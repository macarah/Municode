Chapter 5.24 - COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
Sections:

5.24.010 - Purpose.
This Deferred Compensation Plan is designed to permit employees of Los Angeles County to defer a portion of their compensation and provide for retirement and death benefits.
While the County intends to continue the Plan, it reserves the right to terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, at any time. Benefits under the Plan shall at all times be limited to those payable from Participants' Deferred Accounts to the extent funded by County Contributions that have been made and credited to such Accounts, subject as provided herein to the claims of the County's general creditors. Therefore, neither participation in the Plan nor eligibility therefor shall entitle any employee to have the Plan or any of its provisions continued for his benefit in the future.

Investment in General. All Deferred Compensation Contributions shall be invested (the "Investment Fund") by the Administrative Committee in annuity policies, deposit certificates, mutual funds or other assets to provide convenient methods of setting aside a portion of County assets to meet County obligations under the Plan. All Deferred Compensation Contributions, property and rights purchased with such amounts, and all income attributable to such amounts, property or rights shall remain solely the property and rights of the County and subject to the claims of the County's general creditors, until distributed to Participants or Beneficiaries. The Investment Fund shall at all times remain a part of the general assets of the County, and shall remain available for the payment of County debts. Neither the existence of the Plan nor the Investment Fund shall be deemed to create a trust or shall entitle any Participant, the Beneficiary of any Participant, or a creditor of any Participant, to a claim or lien against the assets of the Investment Fund.
B.
Allocation by Participants. Each Participant may allocate his Deferred Compensation Contributions, with the consent of the County, among the investment alternatives offered under the Plan. With the consent of the Administrative Committee, the Participant may also change the allocation of future Deferred Compensation Contributions and may transfer past Deferred Compensation Contributions, adjusted for earnings, gains and losses, if any, from one investment alternative to another.
(Ord. 87-0061 § 2 (part), 1987.)
5.24.060 - Participant's account.
The County shall maintain a Deferred Account for each Participant. The Deferred Account of each Participant shall be credited with earnings thereon, if any, and the Participant's Deferred Account shall be credited or debited, as the case may be, with the net amount of any gains or losses which may result from the investment of the Deferred Account in the investment alternatives. The County shall not be liable for any losses on any amount allocated to any investment alternative.
(Ord. 87-0061 § 2 (part), 1987.)
5.24.070 - Benefit distributions.
A.
Distributions in General. The entire balance in a Participant's Deferred Account shall be distributed to him or his Beneficiary in a lump-sum payment on the earlier of 90 days after the Participant undergoes a Separation from Service or 60 days after the close of the Plan Year in which the Participant undergoes a Separation from Service; provided, however, that a Participant or his Beneficiary may choose a later time and/or different method of distribution in accordance with this section on an election form provided by the Administrative Committee. The election form shall be filed with the County on or before the earlier of the 75th day after the Participant undergoes a Separation from Service or the 45th day after the close of the Plan Year in which the Participant undergoes a Separation from Service. The electing Participant or Beneficiary shall also furnish such other information as the Administrative Committee or its duly authorized agent may require. If the Participant or his Beneficiary cannot be located within four years of the date the Participant's interest under the plan is first payable, the entire balance in his Deferred Account shall be forfeited; provided, however, that the amount so forfeited shall be reinstated retroactive to the date of such forfeiture upon the subsequent filing of an application for benefits under the Plan, and payment of the lump-sum benefit shall be made not later than 60 days after the application is filed.
Distributions under the Plan to a Participant or his Beneficiary shall be made in cash in accordance with one of the following methods:
1.
A lump-sum payment, or
2.
Equal monthly, quarterly or annual installments not extending over more than 15 years, or
3.
Consecutive periodic payments for the life of the Participant and his spouse and the last survivor of them, or
4.
A combination of the methods of payment described in subdivisions 1 through 3 of this subsection.
The Participant or the Beneficiary, as the case may be, shall elect either a lump-sum payment, installment payments, an annuity or combination thereof with the consent of the Administrative Committee prior to the commencement of any distribution under this Plan; provided, however, that no method may be selected by a Participant unless the present value of the payment expected to be made to him hereunder is more than 50 percent of the present value of all payments expected to be made to him and his Beneficiary; and provided further, that upon the death of a Beneficiary, any amount to which such Beneficiary would be entitled but for the Beneficiary's death shall be paid to the Beneficiary's estate. In the event that the vested balance of any Participant's Deferred Account is less than $3,500.00, the Administrative Committee shall distribute such Participant's interest under the Plan in a lump sum.
No distribution of the balance in a Participant's Deferred Account elected by the Participant shall commence later than the later of 60 days after the close of the Plan Year (i) in which such Participant attains or, in the case of a Separation from Service prior to normal retirement, would have attained, Normal Retirement Age, or (ii) in which the Separation from Service occurs.
If a Participant to whom benefit payments have commenced pursuant to this section due to his Separation from Service should again become an Eligible Employee before completion of the distribution of his Deferred Account, no further distribution shall be made on account of such prior Separation from Service.
B.
Vesting. Any amount credited to a Participant's Deferred Account shall be nonforfeitable and fully vested.
C.
Normal Retirement. If a Participant's employment with the County is terminated on or after his attaining Normal Retirement Age, the balance in his Deferred Account shall be paid to him in accordance with one of the methods of payment set forth in this section commencing no later than 60 days after the close of the Plan Year in which such Participant undergoes a Separation from Service.
D.
Separation from Service. Upon a Participant's Separation from Service prior to his attaining Normal Retirement Age, the amount credited to his Account shall be distributed pursuant to this section after such Separation from Service, but such distribution shall commence no later than the date 60 days after the close of the Plan Year in which such Participant attains Normal Retirement Age.
E.
Death.
1.
Before Termination of Service. In the event of the death of the Participant while he is an Employee, the balance of his Deferred Account shall be paid to his Beneficiary in accordance with this section. Such payment shall commence no later than 60 days after the close of the Plan Year in which the deceased Participant would have attained Normal Retirement Age.
2.
Following Separation from Service. In the event of the death of a Participant following his Separation from Service with the County, the Administrative Committee shall commence payment of the balance, if any, in the Participant's Deferred Account to his Beneficiary in accordance with this section no later than 60 days after the close of the Plan Year in which the deceased Participant would have attained Normal Retirement Age, unless payment of benefits has already commenced, in which event such payments shall be continued in accordance with the method of payment previously selected by the Participant.
F.
Emergency Withdrawals. The Administrative Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit a Participant upon written request to the Committee to make a withdrawal from the Plan to meet an unforeseeable emergency. An unforeseeable emergency is a severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from sudden illness or accident of the Participant, Participant's spouse, and/or a dependent of the Participant, loss of the Participant's property due to casualty or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. A distribution under this subsection may not be made to the extent the hardship is or can be relieved through compensation by insurance, by liquidation of the Participant's other assets (to the extent the liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship), or ceasing further deferrals under the Plan. Withdrawal of amounts based on an unforeseeable emergency will be permitted by the County only to the extent reasonably needed to satisfy the emergency, and shall not exceed the amount credited to such Participant's Deferred Account. Any withdrawal permitted pursuant to this subsection shall be paid by the County within 60 days of the Administrative Committee's approval of the Participant's written request.
G.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, to the extent permitted by Section 457(e)(9) of the Code and regulations thereunder, a Participant (i) whose Account is Credited with $3,500.00 or less and (ii) who is no longer entitled to defer compensation under the Plan may elect in writing to receive the balance credited to such Account in a lump sum payable as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days, after such election is filed with the Administrative Committee.
(Ord. 87-0061 § 2 (part), 1987.)

A.
The Plan shall be administered by the Administrative Committee; provided, however, that consistent with Section 44.7 of the Los Angeles County Charter and Part 3 of Chapter 2.104 of this Code, the Administrative Committee may contract with one or more private firms for services related to the Plan. For purposes of determining whether retirement eligibility is present, the Administrative Committee may rely on the determination of the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association.
B.
Expenses incurred as a result of County employees performing the functions defined in this section may be reimbursed from Plan assets and paid to the County. The expenses so charged will be allocated to the individual Participants' Deferred Accounts. The annual charges shall not exceed the amount approved by the Board of Supervisors in the County budget and will only include direct, additional County costs. Expenses incurred as a result of contractors performing these functions will be similarly charged and are limited by the contract or contracts approved by the Administrative Committee.
C.
The Administrative Committee shall be responsible for the administration of the Plan, including but not limited to the preparation and delivery to the Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County, Participants, Beneficiaries and governmental agencies of all information, descriptions and reports required by applicable law.

Distributions from the Deferred Compensation Plan which commence or are approved to commence before the Merger Date shall continue or commence, as the case may be, pursuant to the distribution provisions and procedures of the Deferred Compensation Plan.

To the extent and in the manner permitted under Section 457(e)(10) of the Code and regulations thereunder, the balance of the Account of a Participant who is no longer an Employee and who subsequently becomes a participant in another plan qualified under Section 457 of the Code shall be transferred to his account in the plan of his new employer, provided that the plan provides for the receipt of such transferred amounts. If a Participant's Account has been transferred to such plan, the Participant shall not be entitled to receive any benefit under this Plan, anything in Section 5.24.070 to the contrary notwithstanding.
B.
If, prior to becoming an Employee, an individual participated in a plan qualified under Section 457 of the Code, the County will accept transfer of any amount credited to the deferred compensation account of such Employee under the predecessor plan and establish for the Employee an Account under the Plan to which such amount shall be credited. In all respects such amount shall be treated as an amount deferred under and subject to the terms of the Plan, except that no amount so transferred will be taken into account in applying the deferral limitations set forth in Section 5.24.040.
