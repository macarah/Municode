22.60.390 - Zoning enforcement order and noncompliance fee.*
A.
Final Zoning Enforcement Order.
1.
In the course of enforcing any provision of this title, the Planning Director shall have the authority to issue a final zoning enforcement order concerning any property not in compliance with the provisions of this title. Such order shall state, in not less than 14 point type in substantially the following form, that "Failure of the owner or person in charge of the premises to comply with this order within fifteen (15) days after the compliance date specified herein, or any written extension thereof, shall subject the violator to a noncompliance fee in the amount of $732.00, unless an appeal from this order is filed within fifteen (15) days after the compliance date. Such appeal must comply with Section 22.60.390 C of the Los Angeles County Code." The director's issuance of a final zoning enforcement order shall be final unless an appeal from the order has been filed as provided in this section.
2.
Service of a final zoning enforcement order shall be upon (a) the person in real or apparent charge and control of the premises involved, (b) the record owner, (c) the owner or holder of any lease of record, or (d) the record owner of any interest in or to the land or any building or structure located thereon. Service shall be by personal delivery or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at the director's election. In the event the director, after reasonable effort, is unable to serve the order as specified above, proper service shall be by posting a copy of the order on the premises. The date of service is deemed to be the date of mailing, personal delivery or posting, as applicable.
B.
Noncompliance Fee.
1.
If a final zoning enforcement order has not been complied with within 15 days following the compliance date specified in the order, or any written extension thereof, and no appeal of such order has been timely filed as provided in this section, the director shall have the authority to impose and collect a noncompliance fee in the amount of $732.00. The fee shall be subject to annual review and adjustment as provided in Section 22.60.100.
2.
The purpose of the noncompliance fee is to recover costs of zoning enforcement inspections and other efforts by the director to secure substantial compliance with a zoning enforcement order. Not more than one such fee shall be collected for failure to comply with a zoning enforcement order. The noncompliance fee shall be in addition to any other fees required by the county code.
3.
The determination of the director to impose and collect a zoning noncompliance fee shall be final, and it shall not be subject to further administrative appeal.
C.
Appeal of Final Zoning Enforcement Order.
1.
Any person upon whom a final zoning enforcement order has been served may appeal the order to the hearing officer within the time specified in subsection A of this section above. Such appeal shall contain any written evidence that the appellant wishes to be considered in connection with the appeal. If applicable, the appeal shall state that said person has applied for the appropriate permit or other administrative approval pursuant to this title.
2.
The hearing officer shall consider such appeal within 45 days from the date that the appeal is filed and shall notify the appellant of the decision within a reasonable period of time thereafter in the manner described in this section for service of a final zoning enforcement order. The hearing officer may sustain, rescind or modify the final zoning enforcement order. The decision of the hearing officer shall be final and effective on the date of decision, and it shall not be subject to further administrative appeal.
D.
Imposition and Collection of the Noncompliance Fee.
1.
The director shall notify the person against whom a noncompliance fee is imposed in the manner described in this section for service of a final zoning enforcement order. The director may waive the imposition and collection of a noncompliance fee where the director determines such waiver to be in the public interest.
2.
The person against whom the noncompliance fee is imposed shall remit the fee to the director within 15 days after the date of service of said notice.
E.
Penalty After Second Notice of Noncompliance Fee. If the person against whom a noncompliance fee has been imposed fails to pay such fee within 15 days of notification as provided above, the director may send a second notice of noncompliance fee in the manner described in this section for service of a final zoning enforcement order. If the fee has not been paid within 15 days after the date of service of the second notice of noncompliance fee, the County shall withhold the issuance of a building permit or other approval to such person until the noncompliance fee has been paid in full. An administrative penalty assessment equal to two times the noncompliance fee and a collection fee equal to 50 percent of the noncompliance fee shall also be imposed if the fee is not paid within 15 days after the date of service of the second notice. The administrative penalty assessment and collection fee, after notice, shall become part of the debt immediately due and owing to the County. The County thereafter shall have the right to institute legal action in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the amount of the noncompliance fee, administrative penalty assessment and collection fee. In any suit brought by the County to enforce and collect the noncompliance fee, administrative penalty assessment and collection fee, the County shall be entitled to collect all costs and fees incurred in such proceedings.
