1905.1.8   ACI 318, Section 22.10.
Delete ACI 318, Section 22.10, and replace with the following:
. . .
22.10.1 - Structures assigned to Seismic Design Category C, D, E, or F shall not have elements of structural plain concrete, except as follows:
(a)
Concrete used for fill with a minimum cement content of two (2) sacks of Portland cement per cubic yard.
(b)
Isolated footings of plain concrete supporting pedestals or columns are permitted, provided the projection of the footing beyond the face of the supported member does not exceed the footing thickness.
(c)
Plain concrete footings supporting walls are permitted, provided the footings have at least two continuous longitudinal reinforcing bars. Bars shall not be smaller than No. 4 and shall have a total area of not less than 0.002 times the gross cross-sectional area of the footing. A minimum of one bar shall be provided at the top and bottom of the footing. Continuity of reinforcement shall be provided at corners and intersections.
In Seismic Design Categories A, B and C, detached one- and two-family dwellings three stories or less in height and constructed with stud-bearing walls, plain concrete footings with at least two continuous longitudinal reinforcing bars not smaller than No. 4 are permitted to have a total area of less than 0.002 times the gross cross-sectional area of the footing.
