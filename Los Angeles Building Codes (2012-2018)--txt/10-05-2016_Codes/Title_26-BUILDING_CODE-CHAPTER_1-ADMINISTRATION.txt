Whenever the Building Official determines by inspection that a building or structure, whether structurally damaged or not, is dangerous to human life by reason of being located in an area which is unsafe due to hazard from landslide, settlement, or slippage or any other cause, such building shall, for the purpose of this Chapter, be considered an unsafe building.
No person shall own, use, occupy or maintain any unsafe building.
All unsafe buildings are hereby declared to be public nuisances.

Whenever, in such ordinance establishing floodways, reference is made to any floodway, it shall be construed to mean a floodway referred to in this Section. A person shall not perform work for which a building or grading permit is required within the boundaries of an established floodway if such work increases the flood hazard to adjacent properties by either increasing the capital flood water surface elevation, deflecting flows or increasing bank erosion. Such work may be performed within an established floodway, and a building or grading permit therefor may be issued, where provisions are made to the satisfaction of the Building Official to avoid such an increase in the flood hazard.

The engineering geology or soils engineering report or both shall contain a finding regarding the safety of the site of the proposed work against hazard from landslide, settlement or slippage and a finding regarding the effect that the proposed work will have on the geotechnical stability of the area outside of the proposed work. Any engineering geology report shall be prepared by a certified engineering geologist licensed in the State of California. Any soils engineering report shall be prepared by a civil engineer licensed in the State of California, experienced in the field of soil mechanics, or a geotechnical engineer licensed in the State of California. When both an engineering geology and soils engineering report are required for the evaluation of the safety of a building site, the two reports shall be coordinated before submission to the Building Official.
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 2 (part), 2007: Ord. 2002-0076 § 53, 2002: Ord. 95-0065 § 3 (part), 1995.)
SECTION 112 - EARTHQUAKE FAULT MAPS
Earthquake fault zone maps within the County of Los Angeles prepared under Sections 2622 and 2623 of the California Resources Code which show traces of earthquake faults are hereby declared to be, on the date of official issue, a part of this Code, and may be referred to elsewhere in this Code. Earthquake fault zone maps revised under the above sections of the California Resources Code shall, on the date of their official issue, supersede previously issued maps which they replace.
Copies of each of the above maps shall be available for examination by the public at the Department of Public Works, Department of Regional Planning and the Executive Office of the Board of Supervisors.
(Ord. 2002-0076 § 54, 2002: Ord. 95-0065 § 3 (part), 1995.)
SECTION 113 - EARTHQUAKE FAULTS
113.1 General.
The construction of a building or structure near a known active earthquake fault and regulated by this Code shall be permitted as set forth in this Section.
(Ord. 95-0065 � 3 (part), 1995.)
113.2 Scope.
The provisions of this Section shall apply only to permits for buildings or structures on individual lots or parcels and are not intended to be supplementary to geologic investigations required to qualify divisions of land as set forth in Title 21 of the Los Angeles County Code, the Subdivision Code.
(Ord. 95-0065 � 3 (part), 1995.)
113.3 Definition.
For the purpose of this Section, a geologist shall be a professional geologist, licensed by the California State Board for Geologists and Geophysicists to practice geology in California.
(Ord. 2007-0108 � 2 (part), 2007: Ord. 95-0065 � 3 (part), 1995.)
113.4 Known Active Earthquake Faults.
For the purpose of this Section, known active earthquake faults are those faults which have had displacement within Holocene time (approximately the last 11,000 years) as defined in the most current issue of Special Publication 42 of the California Geological Survey.
(Ord. 2007-0108 � 2 (part), 2007: Ord. 95-0065 � 3 (part), 1995.)
113.5 Construction Limitations.
No building or structure shall be constructed over or upon the trace of a known active earthquake fault which is shown on maps maintained by the Building Official. These maps include, but are not limited to, earthquake fault zone maps prepared under Sections 2622 and 2623 of the California Public Resources Code.
The absence of a known active earthquake fault trace at the proposed building location shall be determined by a professional geologist licensed in the State of California in the following cases:
1.
When the proposed building is within (50) feet (15.24 m) of that line designated by the Building Official as the assumed location of a known active earthquake fault on the aforementioned maps.
2.
When the proposed building is within 50 feet (15.24 m) of the most probable ground location of the trace of a known active earthquake fault shown on the aforementioned maps.
In these cases the Building Official may require the excavation of a trench, for the purpose of determining the existence of an active earthquake fault. Such a trench will be required if a lack of distinguishable fault features in the vicinity prevents the Building Official from determining by a site examination, review of available aerial photographs, or by other means that the fault trace does not underlie the proposed building. The trench shall be approximately perpendicular to the most probable direction of the fault trace, at least 1-1/2 feet (0.15 m) wide, and at least five feet in depth measured from natural grade, or to a depth satisfactory to the Building Official.
The trench must be accessible for mapping and inspection by the Building Official, when requested, and meet the requirements of Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations, Construction Safety Orders. The trench need not extend further than the full width of the proposed structure plus 5 feet (1.52 m) beyond the traversed exterior walls. A known active earthquake fault shall be presumed nonexistent if an exposure is not found by the professional geologist in the walls or floor of the trench.
The Building Official may require a more extensive investigation by a professional geologist as evidence to the absence of a known active earthquake fault prior to the issuance of a permit for Groups A, E, I, H and R, Division 1 Occupancies and B, F, M and S Occupancies over one story in height.
The results of the investigation, conclusions and recommendations shall be presented in a geology report prepared by a professional geologist as defined by Section 113.3. The report shall comply with the guidelines presented in Note 49 prepared by the California Department of Conservation, Geological Survey.
EXCEPTION: The provisions of this Section do not apply to:
1.
One-story, detached light-frame buildings not intended or used for human occupancy and not exceeding 1,000 square feet (92.9 m 2 ) in gross floor area or 12 feet (3.66 m) in building height.
2.
Alterations or repairs to an existing building provided that the aggregate value of such work within any 12-month period does not exceed 50 percent of the current market value of the existing building. For the purposes of this Section 113.5, "alteration" does not include an addition or additions.
3.
Swimming pools, retaining walls, fences and minor work of a similar nature.

113.6 Maps of Active Faults.
The Department of Public Works shall maintain maps available to the public showing the location of known active earthquake faults. In the absence of additional information, the location of known active earthquake faults shall be as shown on Earthquake fault zone maps as required by Section 112.
(Ord. 2002-0076 � 56, 2002: Ord. 95-0065 � 3 (part), 1995.)
113.7 Earthquake Fault Zones.
Work within the earthquake fault zones established under Sections 2622 and 2623 of the California Public Resources Code shall comply with State laws, policies, criteria, rules and regulations applicable to such work. Fees established by Chapter 7.5 of Division 2 of the California Public Resources Code shall be collected and disbursed as required by State law.
In addition to the State regulations, the provisions of this Section shall apply when geologic investigations, mapping, aerial photographs, other acceptable data or Earthquake Fault Zone Maps show the location of a known active earthquake fault as defined by Section 113.4.
