No person, whether as a principal or agent, clerk or employee, either for himself or any other person, or as an officer of any corporation, or otherwise, shall place or maintain a news rack on or projecting onto a highway unless and until a news rack permit has been obtained from the director of public works or his designate (the "director").
(Ord. 98-0069 § 1, 1998: Ord. 11516 § 2 (part), 1977: Ord. 10816 § 3, 1973: Ord. 9349 § 1 (part), 1967: Ord. 3597 Ch. 12 § 1201, 1940.)
16.24.020 - Permit�Application and fee.
Upon proper application on forms provided by the commissioner, containing all information that is required by Sections 16.08.010 and 16.08.020 of this Division 1, and following payment of all applicable fees required pursuant to this Division 1, the commissioner shall issue the applicant an annual news rack permit for each requested news rack or group of news racks as defined in Section 16.24.070 D that meets all of the requirements of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Division 1, the commissioner may not refuse to issue a news rack permit properly applied for. Each application must be accompanied by a site map showing the width of the sidewalk and the location of each proposed news rack installation and any and all structures, encroachments or objects of any kind or character located within 25 feet of the proposed installation including, but not limited to, traffic signals, street light poles, fire hydrants, bus benches, utility poles, telephones, building entrances, driveways and parking meters. Each application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable annual news rack permit fee of $152.00 for each proposed news rack or $200.00 for each proposed group of two news racks or $245.00 for each proposed group of three news racks. The fee shall offset the costs of administration and inspection services incurred by the commissioner in connection with the review of the application and the costs of monitoring and enforcing the News Rack Ordinance. Each news rack or group of news racks proposed to be placed or maintained on or projecting onto any highway shall require a separate permit. On July 1st of each year, each fee imposed by this section shall be reviewed by the commissioner and the amount of each fee shall be adjusted as follows: Calculate the percentage movement between March of the previous year and March of the current year in the CPI for all urban consumers in the Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County area, as published by the United States Government Bureau of Labor Statistics, adjust each fee by said percentage amount, and round up to the nearest dollar. No adjustment shall increase any fee to an amount more than the amount necessary to recover the cost of providing the services for which the fee is imposed.
