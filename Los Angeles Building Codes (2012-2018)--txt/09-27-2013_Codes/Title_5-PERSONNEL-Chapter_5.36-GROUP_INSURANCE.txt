Editor's note— For statutory provisions on group insurance for local governmental employees, see Gov. Code § 53200 et seq. Art 97 on group insurance was originally added to Ord. 4099 by Ord. 9102 § 1, 1966 (as amended by Ords. 9392 §§ 1—3, 1967; 9296 § 1, 1968 and 9918 §§ 1—2, 1969). These provisions were then entirely amended by Ord. 10275 § 2, 1971 (as amended by Ords. 10524 § 1, 1972; 10616 § 1, 1972; 10700 § 1, 1973 and 10760 § 1, 1973), and then again entirely amended by Ord. 10923 § 2, 1974, as amended. While all these provisions are current, only Ord. 4099 and Ord. 10923 and its amendments can be set forth accurately in legislative history notes.
