Chapter 21.52 - MODIFICATIONS
Sections:

21.52.010 - Modification or waiver of provisions authorized when.
A.
Whenever, in the opinion of the advisory agency, the land involved in a subdivision is of such size or shape, or is subject to such title limitations of record or is affected by such topographical location or conditions, or is to be devoted to such usage, that it is impossible or impractical for the subdivider to conform fully to a regulation contained in this Title 21, the advisory agency may at the time of action on the tentative map of the subdivision modify the regulation, provided that in the case of each modification the advisory agency shall first find that a special, individual reason makes the strict letter of the regulation impossible or impractical of observance and that the modification is in conformity with the spirit and purpose of the Subdivision Map Act and of this title; and provided, further, that the advisory agency shall make a report in writing setting forth each modification and the facts relied upon for making the modification.
B.
The advisory agency, the county engineer or the board of supervisors shall waive the provisions of this title and of Section 66473 of the Subdivision Map Act requiring disapproval of maps for failure to meet or perform state or local requirements or conditions, when the failure of a map submitted for approval is the result of a technical and inadvertent error which, in the determination of the advisory agency, the county engineer or the board of supervisors does not materially affect the validity of the map. Such waivers shall not result in the invalidation or negation of any substantive requirement of this title, the Subdivision Map Act, or any other ordinance, statute or regulation.
C.
The advisory agency or the board of supervisors may make modifications to regulations contained in this Title 21 including, but not limited to, exemption from park space requirements for land divisions where a housing permit for qualified projects as provided for in Title 22 is also approved.
D.
The Director or the advisory agency may make modifications to regulations contained in this Title 21 pertaining to the consideration of a reasonable accommodation, as provided for in Title 22
(Ord. 2011-0067 § 1, 2011: Ord. 2006-0063 § 1, 2006; Ord. 86-0170 § 1, 1986; Ord. 11665 § 4, 1978: Ord. 9721 § 1, 1969: Ord. 9071 § 2, 1966; Ord. 4478 Art. 1 § 6, 1945.)
21.52.020 - Waiver of certain processing fees—Authorized when.
In those instances where the board of supervisors, by resolution, determines it in the public interest to accept or process applications for low and moderate income housing projects without one or more of the county fees required by Chapter 21.40 or by Chapter 21.44 or by Chapter 21.48 or by subsection C of Section 21.36.010 of Chapter 21.36, the county shall accept or process such applications subject to the requirements specified in said resolution.

That such modifications would not alter any right, title or interest in the real property; and
