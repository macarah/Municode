If a conditional use permit has first been obtained as provided in Part 1 of Chapter 22.56, property in Zone MPD may be used for a planned industrial development in which the hearing officer may approve any use permitted in Zone M-1½, subject to all of the following provisions:
1.
Area. The proposed development plan shall include a parcel of land having, as a condition of use, not less than five acres. A development plan may be considered on a parcel of land less than five acres in area when such property is in Zone MPD and has a common boundary with property which has been developed under an approved plan pursuant to this subsection B. In such case, the plan shall indicate that the proposed development will constitute an orderly extension in arrangement of buildings, facilities and improvements throughout the combined parcels of land in addition to all the other requirements for approval of a conditional use permit.
2.
Compatibility. The proposed development, including the specific industrial uses proposed, shall not be in conflict with the objectives of the general plan for the area.
3.
Design. The structural improvements shall not detract from the established or anticipated character of the surrounding area, as indicated by schematic drawings and renderings to scale showing the architectural design of buildings and structures to be established.
4.
Access and Parking. Adequate provision shall be made for vehicular access, parking and loading so as to prevent undue traffic congestion on adjacent streets or highways, particularly local streets.
5.
Building Density. The floor area ratio shall not be greater than 1.0, and the ground-floor area of buildings shall not exceed 60 percent of the gross area of the lot or parcel of land. This does not permit a reduction in the parking requirement specified in this Title 22.

6.
Utilities. The applicant shall submit to the hearing officer, and it shall be made a condition of approval, satisfactory evidence that the applicant has made arrangements with the serving utilities to install underground all new facilities necessary to furnish service in the development. This requirement may be waived where it would cause undue hardship or constitute an unreasonable requirement.
7.
Signs. The hearing officer, in granting the conditional use permit, may allow signs which it finds will be in keeping with the concept of planned development.
8.
Development Features. The development plan shall include yards, walls, walks, landscaping and other such features as may be needed to make the industrial development attractive, adequately buffered from adjacent more restrictive uses, and in keeping with the established or anticipated development of the surrounding area.
9.
Development Schedule. The hearing officer shall approve a progress schedule, including all phases of development, and indicating that the improvements described in the development plan will be made prior to occupancy of industrial buildings. The hearing officer may modify without a hearing this condition pertaining to the development schedule based upon an affirmative showing, in writing, of hardship.

Tentative Subdivision Map. A tentative map shall be filed and made a condition of approval.
C.
