CHAPTER 34 - EXISTING STRUCTURES

SECTION 3401 GENERAL
3401.8 Parapets and appendages.
3401.8.1
Whenever the Building Official determines by inspection that, as a result of inadequate construction or bracing to resist horizontal forces, an existing parapet or appendage attached to and supported by an exterior wall of a building is likely to become a hazard to life or property in the event of earthquake disturbance, and such parapet or appendage is not an immediate hazard or danger as described in Section 102 of this Code, the Building Official may provide the owner of the building or other person or agent in control of the building where such parapet or other appendage exists, with a written notice specifying the hazards and the inadequacies of construction or bracing.
The owner of the building or other person or agent in control of the building shall, within 12 months from the date of such written notice, eliminate the hazard as set forth below. Any person receiving notice as set out in this Section may appeal, in the manner provided by Section 102.4 of this Code, to the building Board of Appeals.
(Ord. 2010-0053 § 72, 2010.)
3401.8.2
The parapet or appendage shall be removed and the remainder of the wall anchored at the roof line, or it shall be reconstructed so that it will conform structurally as near as it is practicable to do so with requirements of Chapter 16 of this Code, or it shall be otherwise braced and strengthened in a manner satisfactory to the Building Official, so that it will resist a reasonable degree of horizontal forces without becoming dislodged with danger of falling.
(Ord. 2010-0053 § 72, 2010.)
3401.8.3
Where, in the opinion of the Building Official, it is necessary to open a portion of roof, wall, or ceiling of a building in order to determine the structural condition of any parapet or appendage, the Building Official may order the owner to make such opening and the owner shall comply with said order at the owner's sole cost and expense.
(Ord. 2010-0053 § 72, 2010.)
3401.9 Existing glass.
Whenever the Building Official determines by inspection that an existing glass installation in rooms having an occupant load of more than 100 persons or a means of egress serving an occupant load of more than 100 persons, as determined by Chapter 10, is likely to become a hazard in the event of accidental human impact as described in Section 2406.4 and such installation does not comply with the provisions of this Code for glazing in such locations, the Building Official may provide the owner of the building or other person or agent in control of the building where such glazing exists with a written notice of such condition. The owner of the building or other person or agent in control of the building shall, within 90 days after receiving said notice, replace such glass or otherwise cause the installation to conform with the requirements of this Code.
(Ord. 2010-0053 § 73, 2010.)

The owner of the building or other person or agent in control of the building shall, within 12 months from the date of such written notice, eliminate the hazard as set forth below. Any person receiving notice as set out in this section may appeal, in the manner provided by Section 102.4 of this code, to the building board of appeals.
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 24 (part), 2007.)
3403.5.2.
The parapet or appendage shall be removed and the remainder of the wall anchored at the roof line, or it shall be reconstructed so that it will conform structurally as near as it is practicable to do so with requirements of Chapter 16 of this code, or it shall be otherwise braced and strengthened in a manner satisfactory to the building official, so that it will resist a reasonable degree of horizontal forces without becoming dislodged with danger of falling.
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 24 (part), 2007.)
3403.5.3.
Where, in the opinion of the building official, it is necessary to open a portion of roof, wall or ceiling of a building in order to determine the structural condition of any parapet or appendage, the building official may order the owner to make such opening and the owner shall comply with said order at the owners sole cost and expense.

Existing Glass.
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 24 (part), 2007.)
3403.7 Security Bars or Grilles.
Every person who owns, operates or maintains a hotel, apartment house, lodging house or dwelling on which security bars or grilles exist at exterior doors or windows shall remove or modify such bars or grilles as necessary to conform with the specific requirements of this section. This section shall apply only to the main entrance door to the dwelling unit and to exterior doors and windows at sleeping rooms.
EXCEPTIONS:
1.
Sleeping rooms above the third floor.
2.
Main entrance door of a dwelling unit where each sleeping room contains an exterior door or an exterior window with a net clear openable area of not less than 5 square feet (0.46 m2) with no dimension less than 22 inches (559 mm) and with a sill height not more than 48 inches (1219 mm) above the floor. Where bars or grilles exist at these openings, they shall be openable from the inside without use of a key, tool or excessive force.
Bars or grilles shall be modified, or installed, to be removable or openable from the inside without the use of a key, tool or excessive force. When in the removed or open position, the net opening shall not be less than that which would be available through the door or window if such bars or grilles were not installed.

SECTION 3404 - FIRE ESCAPES
SECTION 3422 - REPAIRS TO BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES DAMAGED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF A NATURAL DISASTER
3422.1 Purpose.
The purpose of this division is to provide a defined level of repair for buildings damaged by a natural disaster in jurisdictions where a formal state of emergency has been proclaimed.
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 24 (part), 2007.)
3422.2 General.
Required repair levels shall be based on the ratio of the estimated value of the repairs required to restore the structural members to their pre-event condition to the estimated replacement value of the building or structure.
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 24 (part), 2007.)
3422.3 Structural repairs.
3422.3.1.
When the damage ratio does not exceed 0.1 (10 %), buildings and structures, except essential service facilities included as Category I buildings and structures in Table 1604.5, shall at a minimum be restored at their pre-event condition.
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 24 (part), 2007.)
3422.3.2.
When the damage ratio is greater than 0.10 (10 %) but less than 0.5 (50 percent), buildings and structures, except essential service facilities included as Category IV buildings and structures in Table 1604.5, shall have the damaged structural members including all critical ties and connections associated with the damaged structural members, all structural members supported by the damaged member, and all structural members supporting the damaged members repaired and strengthened to bring them into compliance with the force levels and connection requirements of the Building Code. This criteria shall apply to essential service facilities when the damage ratio is less than 0.3 (30 %).
EXCEPTION: For buildings with rigid diaphragms where the above-required repair and strengthening increases the rigidity of the resisting members, the entire lateral-force-resisting system of the building shall be investigated. When, in the opinion of the building official, an unsafe or adverse condition has been created as a result of the increase in rigidity, the condition shall be corrected, as approved by the building official.
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 24 (part), 2007.)
3422.3.3.
When the damage ratio is greater than 0.5 (50 %), buildings and structures, except essential service facilities included as Category IV buildings and structures in Table 1604.5, shall at a minimum have the entire building or structure strengthened to comply with the force levels and connection requirements of the Building Code. This criteria shall apply to essential service facilities when the damage ratio is greater or equal to 0.3 (30 %).
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 24 (part), 2007.)
3422.4 Nonstructural repairs to light fixtures and suspended ceilings.
Under all damage ratios, when light fixtures and the suspension system of suspended ceiling are damaged, the damaged light fixtures and suspension systems shall be repaired to fully comply with the requirements of this code and Standard 25-2 of the Uniform Building Code, 1997 Edition, as published by the International Conference of Building Officials. Undamaged light fixtures and suspension systems shall have the additional support and bracing, as may be required by Standard 25-2 of the Uniform Building Code, 1997 Edition, as published by the International Conference of Building Officials.
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 24 (part), 2007.)
