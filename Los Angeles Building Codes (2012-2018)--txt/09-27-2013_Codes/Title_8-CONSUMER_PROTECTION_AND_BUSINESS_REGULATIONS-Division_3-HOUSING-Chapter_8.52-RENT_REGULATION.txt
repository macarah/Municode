Chapter 8.52 - RENT REGULATION
Sections:

8.52.010 - Declaration of purpose.
Due to a critical shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing in the unincorporated areas of the county, the board of supervisors enacted the ordinance codified in this chapter and from time to time extended it. A two-year phased deregulation extended rent control until June 30, 1983. It was based upon the extreme financial hardship to and a dislocation of numerous rent-controlled tenants which would ensue as a result of immediate termination of rent regulation. The board now finds that because rents to existing tenants have been held at artificially low levels, a two-tier rent structure has been created; that is, market-rate rents for new tenants and substantially under-market rents for tenants with controlled units. By lifting all controls at this time, the rent levels on the regulated units will have a tendency to rise to market value in a relatively short period. The result will be tenant dislocation and short-term economic hardships, especially for the elderly, if the current ordinance is immediately terminated. The board finds that, due to vacancy decontrol, a large percentage of rental units are no longer subject to rent control and, further, that rental units occupied by the elderly are more likely still to be subject to rent control since the mobility of such individuals is substantially less than that of other renters. Therefore, those elderly on fixed incomes who remain in controlled units will be severely impacted by sudden decontrol. The board, nevertheless, finds that it is necessary in the long term to provide sufficient incentives and reduce rent-control regulation in order to create opportunities for new construction in the county. For these reasons, this board now finds it necessary in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the unincorporated area of the county, to adopt a transition ordinance with a 30-month term, terminating on December 31, 1985. The transition ordinance provides that during the last 12 months of its term (January 1, 1985 through December 31, 1985), units shall be permanently removed from rent control based on the month that the tenant then occupying the controlled unit initially moved into the unit. For example, if a tenant moved into a controlled unit on March 5, 1975, the unit would be removed from rent control on March 31, 1985; if the tenant moved in on December 1, 1977, the unit would be removed on December 31, 1985. The board finds that this mechanism will ease the administrative difficulties in winding down the ordinance.

8.52.011 - Declaration of purpose for two-week extension.
The board of supervisors finds that although many rental units have been subject to vacancy decontrol under the existing rent regulation ordinance, the problems posed by immediate decontrol, as of June 30, 1983, for the tenants still subject to rent control are likely to be major. The board is currently exploring practical methods of alleviating those problems for tenants while insuring the rights of landlords to experience a just and reasonable return on their investment. Specifically, the board has under consideration a proposal for the 30-month extension of rent regulation and the establishment of a mediation panel through which tenants would be accorded an opportunity to meet and confer with landlords prior to eviction or imposition of rental increases. In order to study the effects of such a proposal upon the current housing problems and to determine the extent of current effects of the housing shortage, this board finds that it is necessary to continue to regulate rents at their current rate for an additional two weeks until July 14, 1983.

(Ord. 82-0055 § 1, 1982: Ord. 12148 § 1 (part), 1980: Ord. 11950 § 4.5, 1979.)
8.52.070 - Rent adjustments—Procedures and conditions—Rent adjustment commission authority.
A.
The rent adjustment commission, acting through its rent adjustment panels or staff, in accordance with guidelines developed by the regional planning department and approved by the board, shall have the authority to grant adjustments in the rent for a rental unit or units located in the same housing complex upon receipt of an application for adjustment filed by the landlord of the unit or units if it finds that one or more of the following grounds exist:
1.
That on or after April 1, 1978, the landlord has completed a capital improvement with respect to a rental unit and has not increased the rent to reflect the cost of such improvement. If a rent adjustment panel or staff so finds, the landlord shall be entitled to a monthly rental increase calculated by amortizing the cost of such improvement over a period of time set forth in regulations adopted by the commission; provided, however, that in no event shall the monthly rent increase exceed one-sixtieth (1/60) of the average per unit capital improvement cost;
2.
That on or after April 1, 1978, the landlord has completed rehabilitation work with respect to a rental unit and has not increased the rent to reflect the cost of such work. If a rent adjustment panel so finds, the landlord shall be entitled to a monthly rent increase of one-thirty-sixth (1/36) of the average per unit rehabilitation cost;
3.
That the maximum rent otherwise permitted by this chapter does not permit a just and reasonable return on the rental unit or units. The following are factors, as the regional planning department may develop and propose to the board for approval which may be considered in determining whether a rental unit yields a just and reasonable return:
a.
Property taxes,
b.
Reasonable operating and maintenance expenses,
c.
The extent of capital improvements made to the building in which the rental unit is located, as distinguished from ordinary repair, replacement and maintenance,
d.
Living space, and the level of the housing services,
e.
Substantial deterioration of the rental units other than as a result of ordinary wear and tear, and
f.
Failure to perform ordinary repair, replacement and maintenance.
B.
Anti-speculation Provision. If the only justification offered on the landlord's application for the requested rent increase, pursuant to subsection A3 of this section, is an assertion that the maximum rents permitted pursuant to this chapter do not allow the landlord return sufficient to pay both the operating expenses and debt service on the rental unit or units or on the housing complex containing the rental unit or units, a rent adjustment will not be permitted pursuant to this subsection to a landlord who acquired an interest in the rental unit or units after July 1, 1979.
C.
Procedures.
1.
An application for rent adjustment shall be submitted on a form and with the number of copies prescribed by the clerk of the rent adjustment commission, and shall include among other things the addresses and unit numbers of the unit or units for which an adjustment is requested. Such application may include all rental units in a housing complex for which a rent increase is requested. An application must be accompanied by a $25.00 filing fee. An applicant shall produce at the request of the rent adjustment commission or designee such records, receipts or reports as the commission or designee may deem necessary to make a determination on the adjustment request. Failure to produce such requested items shall be sufficient basis for the commission or designee to terminate the rent adjustment proceeding. All applications for rent adjustment, together with all written evidence presented in support thereof, shall be under oath or penalty of perjury.
2.
Upon receipt of a completed application, the clerk of the rent adjustment commission shall notify by mail the tenant or tenants of the subject unit or units of the receipt of such application, the amount of the requested rent increase, the landlord's justification for the request and the tenant's right to submit written objections to the applicant's request within 10 working days.
3.
A determination, with written findings in support thereof, shall be made by a rent adjustment panel or staff within 30 days from the date of the filing of the application; provided, however, that said 30-day time limit shall be suspended and not continue to run until such time as the landlord has furnished all information requested by the commission or designee. A rent adjustment may be granted for less, but for no more than, the amount requested.
4.
Copies of the findings and determination of the rent adjustment panel or staff shall be mailed by the panel to the applicant and all affected tenants. The determination shall be final unless appealed by the applicant or any affected tenant within 15 working days from the date of determination. Appeals shall be in writing.

A.
Permissible Causes. A landlord may bring an action to recover possession of a rental unit only upon one of the following grounds:
1.
The tenant has failed to pay the rent to which the landlord is entitled;
2.
The tenant has violated an obligation or covenant of the tenancy, other than the obligation to surrender possession upon proper notice, and has failed to cure such violation after having received written notice thereof from the landlord;
3.
The tenant is committing or permitting to exist a nuisance in, or is causing damage to the rental unit or to the appurtenances thereof, or to the common areas of the complex containing the rental unit, or is creating an unreasonable interference with the comfort, safety or enjoyment of any of the other residents of the same or any adjacent building;
4.
The tenant is using or permitting a rental unit to be used for any illegal purpose;
5.
The tenant who had a written lease or rental agreement which terminated on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, has refused, after written request or demand by the landlord, to execute a written extension or renewal thereof for a further term of like duration with similar provisions and in such terms as are not inconsistent with or violative of any provision of this chapter;
6.
The tenant has refused the landlord reasonable access to the unit for the purpose of making repairs or improvements, or for the purpose of inspection as permitted or required by the lease or by law, or for the purpose of showing the rental unit to any prospective purchaser or mortgagee;
7.
The person in possession of the rental unit at the end of a lease term is a subtenant not approved by the landlord;
8.
The landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of the rental unit for use and occupancy of the rental unit by the landlord or the landlord's spouse, children, parents, grandparents, grandchildren, brother, sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law;
9.

Notification of Tenants. The landlord shall state the reason for the just-cause eviction on the written notice of termination served on the tenant pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1946.
C.
Retaliatory Evictions. If the dominant intent of the landlord in seeking to recover possession of a rental unit is retaliation against the tenant for exercising his or her rights under this chapter, and if the tenant is not in default as to the payment of rent, the landlord may not recover possession of a rental unit in any action or proceeding or cause the tenant to quit voluntarily.
D.
Notice to Cure. Before a landlord can use tenant violation of a covenant or obligation of tenancy as grounds for eviction pursuant to subsection A2 of this section, the landlord must have provided the tenant with a written statement of the respective covenants and obligations of both the landlord and tenant prior to such alleged violation, and such statement must have set forth the particular covenant or obligation subsequently alleged to have been violated.

In the event the county housing authority uses said funds to subsidize a private development, the authority shall require the developer to execute a covenant and agreement that the project shall be restricted to lower-income apartment use for 20 years. In no event, however, may said funds be used for general administrative expenses of the county housing authority. The use of such funds by the county housing authority shall be in accordance with the following priority:
