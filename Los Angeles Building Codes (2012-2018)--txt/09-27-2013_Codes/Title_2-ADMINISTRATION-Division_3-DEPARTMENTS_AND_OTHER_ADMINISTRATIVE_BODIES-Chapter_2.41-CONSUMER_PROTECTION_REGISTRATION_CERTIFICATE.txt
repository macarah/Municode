Chapter 2.41 - CONSUMER PROTECTION REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE
Sections:

2.41.010 - Introduction.
The Board of Supervisors finds and determines that it is in the public's interest to identify; inspect and register automated point of sale stations, commonly known as "scanners," and to monitor the utilization of such devices.
(Ord. 2002-0014 § 1 (part), 2002)
2.41.020 - Purpose and authority.
It is unlawful to charge, at the time of sale, a price that is more than the price that is advertised or posted. Pursuant to California Business and Professions Code sections 12103.5, 12024.2, and 12024.6, the purpose of this chapter is to ensure that the advertised or posted price of a commodity is the price charged for that commodity. A location shall not be required to sell at a price incorrectly stated in an advertisement which is incorrect as a result of a typographical error or other inadvertent misprint and may also correct pricing errors resulting from the misplacement of merchandise by consumers.
This chapter establishes a system to identify, register and inspect point of sale stations in retail commodity sales. In addition, this chapter authorizes cost recovery for the testing and inspection of these point of sale stations, penalties for failure to register or for late registration and failure to make available a current registration certificate.
This chapter also requires the posting of a toll-free number to consumers at each automated point of sale station. In addition, locations with completed enforcement cases for price accuracy violations shall be required to post notice of the case.
