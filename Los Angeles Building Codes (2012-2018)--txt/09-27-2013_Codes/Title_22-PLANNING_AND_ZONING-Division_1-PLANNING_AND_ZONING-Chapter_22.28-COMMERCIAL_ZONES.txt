Part 8 - CPD COMMERCIAL PLANNED DEVELOPMENT ZONE
Sections:

22.28.340 - Permitted uses and uses subject to permits.
Premises in Zone CPD may be used for:
A.
Any use permitted in Zone R-A, under the same limitations and conditions, including auxiliary and transitional uses, front, side and rear yards, parking and area requirements.
B.
If a conditional use permit has first been obtained, as provided in Part 1 of Chapter 22.56, property in Zone CPD may be used for a planned commercial development in which the hearing officer may approve any nonresidential use permitted in Zone C-1. In the conditional use permit, the hearing officer may modify any of the prescribed standards of development pertaining thereto. Such uses shall be subject to all of the following provisions:
1.
Need For. The hearing officer shall not grant a conditional use permit for a planned commercial development in Zone CPD unless it finds that the proposed commercial development is needed to serve the immediately adjacent area, and development has occurred, or is proposed, which will warrant such commercial development.
2.
Design. The arrangement of buildings, architectural design and the types of commercial uses shall be such as to minimize adverse influences on adjacent properties.
3.
Access and Parking. Adequate provision shall be made for vehicular access, parking and loading so as to prevent undue traffic congestion on adjacent streets and highways, particularly on local streets.
4.
Building Coverage. Buildings shall not occupy more than 40 percent of the gross area. In calculating "gross area," any streets or highways on the perimeter of the parcel of land, or any major or secondary highway or parkway that traverses the property, or any area which is required to be dedicated, or a private easement given for any such street or highway, shall be excluded.
5.
Utilities. The applicant shall submit to the hearing officer, and it shall be made a condition of approval, satisfactory evidence that the applicant has made arrangements with the serving utilities to install underground all new facilities necessary to furnish service in the development. This requirement may be waived where it would cause undue hardship or constitute an unreasonable requirement.
6.
Signs. The hearing officer, in granting the conditional use permit, may allow advertising signs permitted in Zone C-1 which he finds will be in keeping with the concept of planned development.
7.
Development features. The development plan shall include yards, walls, walks, landscaping and such other features as may be needed to make the commercial development attractive, adequately buffered from adjacent more restrictive uses, and in keeping with the character of the surrounding area.
8.
Development Schedule. The hearing officer shall approve a progress schedule including all phases of development and indicating that the improvements described in the development plan will be made prior to occupancy of commercial structures. The hearing officer may modify without a hearing this condition pertaining to the development schedule based upon an affirmative showing, in writing of hardship.
9.
Tentative Subdivision Map. A tentative map shall be filed and made a condition of approval.
