The purpose of this Code is to provide minimum standards to preserve the public health, safety and welfare by regulating the design, construction, installation, quality of materials, location, operation, and maintenance of heating, ventilating, cooling, refrigeration systems, and other miscellaneous heat-producing appliances. Consistent with this purpose, the provisions of this Code are intended and always have been intended to confer a benefit on the community as a whole and are not intended to establish a duty of care toward any particular person.
This code shall not be construed to hold the County or any officer, employee or agent thereof responsible for any damage to persons or property by reason of any inspection authorized herein or by reason of the issuance or non-issuance of any permit authorized herein, and/or for any action or omission in connection with the application and/or enforcement of this Code. By adopting the provisions of this Code the County does not intend to impose on itself, its employees, or agents any mandatory duties of care toward persons and property within its jurisdiction so as to provide a basis of civil liability for damages.
This section is declaratory of existing law and is not to be construed as suggesting that such was not the purpose and intent of previous Code adoptions.

The Chief Mechanical Inspector will satisfy himself as to the right of such applicant to such refund and each such refund shall be paid as provided by law for the payment of claims against the County.

When the installation of any equipment is complete, a second or final inspection shall be made.
Equipment regulated by this Code shall not be connected to the fuel or power supply until authorized by the Building Official.
EXCEPTION: The requirements of this Section shall not be considered to prohibit the operation of any heating equipment installed to replace existing heating equipment serving an occupied portion of a building, in the event a request for inspection of such heating equipment has been filed with the Division not more than 48 hours after such replacement work is completed, and before any portion of such equipment is concealed by any permanent portion of the building.
A final inspection approval may, upon notice, be revoked by the Building Official if he finds that the heating, ventilating, cooling, or refrigeration equipment fails in any respect to comply with the requirements of this Code, or that the installation is unsafe, dangerous, or a hazard to life or property.
(Ord. 2007-0111 § 2 (part), 2007; Ord. 95-0070 § 3 (part), 1995.)
116 - REQUEST FOR INSPECTION
The Building Official may require that every request for inspection be filed at least one day before such inspection is desired. Such request may be in writing or by telephone at the option of the Building Official.
It shall be the duty of the person requesting inspection of any equipment regulated by this Code to provide access to any means for proper inspection of such equipment.
The Building Official shall not be liable for any expense entailed in the removal or replacement of any material required to allow the inspection.

117 - ANNUAL REVIEW OF FEES
The fees contained in this Code shall be reviewed annually by the Director of the Department of Public Works. Beginning on July 1, 1992, and thereafter on each succeeding July 1, the amount of each fee in this Code shall be adjusted as follows: Calculate the percentage movement between March of the previous year and March of the current year in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers in the Los Angeles, Anaheim and Riverside areas, as published by the United States Government Bureau of Labor Statistics, adjust each fee by said percentage amount and round off to the nearest ten (10) cents; provided, however, no adjustment shall decrease any fee and no fee shall exceed this reasonable cost of providing services. When it is determined that the amount reasonably necessary to recover the cost of providing services is in excess of this adjustment, the Chief Mechanical Inspector may present fee proposals to the Board of Supervisors for approval.

It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to erect, install, alter, repair, relocate, add to, replace, use or maintain heating, ventilating, cooling, or refrigeration equipment in the jurisdiction, or cause the same to be done, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this Code. Maintenance of equipment which was unlawful at the time it was installed, and which would be unlawful under this Code if installed after the effective date of this Code, shall constitute a continuing violation of this Code.
Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this Code shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and each such person shall be guilty of a separate offense for each and every day or portion thereof during which any violation of any of the provisions of this Code is committed, continued, or permitted, and upon conviction of any such violation, such person shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $1000.00 or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.
The provisions of this section are in addition to and independent of any sanctions, penalties, or costs which are or may otherwise be imposed for a violation of any provisions of this Code.

APPENDIX 1 - Legislative History for Ordinance 9544.
Ordinance 9544, the Mechanical Code for Los Angeles County, was originally adopted on March 14, 1968. Ordinance 9544 was kept up to date by later amendments until the entire Mechanical Code was repealed and replaced by Ordinance 95-0070. Major amendments to Ordinance 9544, each adopting the current edition of the Uniform Mechanical Code, are listed and briefly described in Table A below; amending ordinances are also listed.
Table B covers the legislative history of the county's own Mechanical Code provisions before Ordinance 95-0070 was passed, and gives the specific legislative history for each section.
Table C shows the correspondence between sections of the 1991 Uniform Mechanical Code and the 1994 Uniform Mechanical Code. The 1991 Uniform Mechanical Code was extensively revised and renumbered to create the 1994 Uniform Mechanical Code.
Provisions of Ordinance 95-0070 and its amendments now comprise Title 29 of the Los Angeles County Code.
