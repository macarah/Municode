Every fuel modification plan shall be reviewed by the forestry division of the fire department for defensible space, reasonable fire safety, and compliance with Sections 325.2.1, 325.2.2, 325.10, and 503.2.1 of this code, the Fire Departments Fuel Modification Guidelines, and California Code of Regulations Title 14, Division 1.5, Chapter 7, subchapter 2. After such final plan has been approved by the forestry division of the fire department, a signed and notarized copy of the provided Covenant and Agreement and or previously reviewed and approved association CC&R's that include the necessary fuel modification information shall be recorded at the registrar-recorder/County clerk's office and a copy given to the Fuel Modification Unit prior to site inspection and release.

An on-site inspection must be conducted by the forestry division of the fire department and a final release issued by the forestry division prior to a certificate of occupancy being granted by the building code official.
