General Rule. Except in extraordinary circumstances described in this subsection D, benefit elections shall be irrevocable for the Plan Year for which they are made. Any new benefit election made under this subsection D must be made within 90 days beginning on the date of the event that is the reason for the new election.

This subsection D shall be interpreted and applied in accordance with applicable Treasury regulations and in a nondiscriminatory manner in accordance with Code Sections 125 and 129.
2.
Revocation of Elections for Status Change; Consistency Rule.
a.
General Rule. The Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, permit (i) a Covered Employee to revoke a benefit election under the Plan and make a new benefit election or (ii) an Eligible Employee who is not participating in the Plan to make a benefit election and commence participation in the Plan, if a Status Change occurs and the election change or new election satisfies the consistency requirements described in subparagraph 2.b below.
b.
Consistency Rules. An election change or new election satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the election change or new election is on account of and corresponds with a Status Change that affects (i) eligibility for coverage under an Employer's dependent care reimbursement account plan, or (ii) expenses described in Code Section 129.
3.
Cost Changes.
a.
Significant Cost Changes. If the cost of a Covered Employee's Qualifying Dependent Care Expenses significantly increases or significantly decreases during a Plan Year, or if the cost to the Employee (e.g., the necessary level of Employee Contributions) to maintain the elected Annual Contribution Credits for the Plan Year increases due to the reduction or termination of Employer Contributions under Section 5.29.040A.2, the Plan Administrator, in its discretion, may permit any affected Covered Employee to revoke his existing election and make a new election to reflect the increased or decreased cost.
b.
Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.29.030D.3, no election changes under the Plan shall be permitted as a result of a change in cost for Qualifying Dependent Care Expenses imposed by a dependent care provider unless such change in cost is imposed by a dependent care provider who is not a qualifying relative (as defined in Code Section 152(d)) of the Covered Employee.
4.
Significant Improvement or Curtailment of Coverage (Services). If the dependent care services being provided to a Covered Employee are significantly improved or curtailed (e.g., if the entity or person providing dependent care services changes or if the hours of services provided change), the Plan Administrator, in its discretion may permit the Covered Employee to revoke his existing election and make a new election to reflect the cost of the modified services.
5.
Change in Coverage Under Another Employer Plan. The Plan Administrator may permit a Covered Employee to prospectively change or revoke an existing benefit election under the Plan if the election change is on account of and corresponds with a change made under another Employer plan (including a plan of the same Employer or of another Employer) that would be permitted under this Section (without regard to this subsection 5). The Plan Administrator also may permit a Covered Employee to make a prospective election to drop coverage under the Plan if dropping such coverage is on account of and consistent with adding coverage under another Employer's plan provided that the period of coverage or plan year under the plan does not correspond with the period of coverage or Plan Year under this Plan.
(Ord. 2008-0014 §§ 9, 10 (part), 2008.)
5.29.040 - Contributions and funding.
A.
Contributions.
1.
Employee Contributions. During enrollment in accordance with Section 5.29.030, and pursuant to the terms of the Cafeteria Plan, an Employee may elect to have his Employer credit a portion of his Contribution (as defined in the Cafeteria Plan) to his Dependent Care Account. The amount elected may not be less than $10 or more than the amount that, together with any monthly Employer Contribution, would cause his Annual Contribution Credits to exceed the Maximum Annual Benefit. To the extent permitted under Code Sections 125 and 129, Employee Contributions will be treated like non-taxable Employer contributions.
2.
Employer Contributions. Each Employer may contribute up to a designated dollar amount per month to the Plan on behalf of each Covered Employee employed by that Employer who elects to receive an Employer Contribution. The Employer shall determine the maximum amount of the monthly Employer Contribution that it will make on behalf of each Covered Employee, as well as any annual cap on total Employer Contributions, before the start of each Plan Year. The Plan Administrator shall disclose to Eligible Employees prior to enrollment the maximum level of Employer Contribution that may be made on behalf of each Covered Employee and the existence of the cap. A Covered Employee does not need to make Employee Contributions to receive an Employer Contribution. An Eligible Employee who does not enroll in the Plan will not be entitled to an Employer Contribution.
In the event the Employer establishes an annual cap on Employer Contributions on behalf of Covered Employees, the Employer may, without prior notice to Covered Employees and at any time during the Plan Year, reduce or terminate the Employer Contribution to be made for some or all Covered Employees in any manner consistent with Code Section 129(d) that it determines is necessary to prevent the cap from being exceeded. The Plan administrator shall notify affected Covered Employees if their Employer Contributions will be reduced or terminated and their Annual Contribution Credits reduced due to imposition of a cap.
3.
Termination or Suspension of Contributions. The Employer will not make an Employer Contribution or Employee Contribution for a month on behalf of a Covered Employee if he works less than 8 hours or receives less than 8 hours of leave benefits in the prior month. The Employer also will not make an Employer Contribution or Employee Contribution on and after the first day of the second month after the Covered Employee ceases to be an Employee or an Eligible Employee unless the Covered Employee changes employment classifications and plan participation as described in Section 5.29.030A.3.a. If the Covered Employee changes employment classifications and plan participation as described in Section 5.29.030A.3.a, he will not receive an Employer Contribution or Employee Contribution on or after the date his coverage under the Plan terminates in accordance with Section 5.29.030C.1.b.
B.
Plan Funding. The Plan is not required to be and is not funded or insured. Benefits paid to a Covered Employee are paid solely out of the general assets of the Employee's Employer.

Qualifying Dependent Care Expenses means expenses incurred by the Covered Employee for household services or for the care of a Qualifying Dependent but only if such expenses are incurred to enable the Covered Employee (and the Covered Employee's spouse, if any) to be gainfully employed or to search for gainful employment for any period for which there are one or more Qualifying Dependents with respect to the Covered Employee, and subject to the exclusions set forth in Section 5.29.050C. For these purposes:
1.
A Covered Employee's spouse is deemed gainfully employed for each month that he is a Full-Time Student or is Incapable of Self-Care.
2.
Volunteer work for a nominal salary does not constitute gainful employment.
3.
Expenses paid for a period during only part of which a Covered Employee or spouse is gainfully employed or in active search of gainful employment must be allocated on a daily basis, unless such expenses are incurred during a short, temporary absence from work (such as for vacation or minor illness) and the dependent care arrangement requires payment for care during the absence. An absence of two consecutive calendar weeks is deemed a short, temporary absence.
4.
Expenses are for the care of a Qualifying Dependent only if their primary purpose is to assure the individual's well-being and protection. Expenses incurred for the care of a Qualifying Dependent may include employment taxes on the wages of a care provider, the additional costs of room and board for a care provider over usual household expenditures, and expenses that relate to, but are not directly for, the care of a Qualifying Dependent such as application fees, agency fees and deposits if the Covered Employee is required to pay those expenses to obtain the related care. Forfeited deposits or other payments are not for the care of a Qualifying Dependent if care is not provided in connection with those amounts.
5.
Expenses are paid for household services if they are paid for the performance in and about the Covered Employee's home of ordinary and usual services necessary to the maintenance of the household, provided the expenses are attributable to the care of a Qualifying Dependent. Services of a housekeeper are household services if the services are provided, at least in part, to the Qualifying Dependent.
6.
Expenses that are incurred for services outside the Covered Employee's household may qualify as Qualifying Dependent Care Expenses only if such expenses are incurred for the care of a Qualifying Dependent described in subsection 5.29.020Y.1 of this Plan or any other Qualifying Dependent who regularly spends at least 8 hours each day in the Covered Employee's household.
7.
Expenses that are incurred for services provided outside the Covered Employee's household by a Dependent Care Center may qualify as Qualifying Dependent Care Expenses only if such center complies with all applicable state and local laws and regulations applicable to such facility.
8.
The cost of transportation by a care provider of a Qualifying Dependent to or from a place where care of the Qualifying Dependent is provided may be for the care of the Qualifying Dependent.
9.
Qualifying Dependent Care Expenses are incurred on the date the dependent care is provided, not on the date charged, billed, or paid.

Any amounts paid for services outside the Covered Employee's household at a camp where the Qualifying Dependent stays overnight;

3.
The costs of a Qualifying Dependent's food, clothing, entertainment, or education (unless for a child below kindergarten) unless those costs are incidental, minimal, and inseparable from the cost of caring for a Qualifying Dependent.
4.
The costs of transportation other than as provided in subsection 5.29.050B.8.
D.
Coverage Period Limitations. Qualifying Dependent Care Expenses reimbursed by the Plan for a Plan Year must have been incurred during the Coverage Period. Accordingly, with regard to each Plan Year, the Plan will not reimburse any expenses incurred:
1.
before the start of the Plan Year or after the end of the Plan Year,
2.
before a benefit election becomes effective in accordance with Section 5.29.030, or
3.
after coverage terminates or during a period in which coverage is suspended in accordance with Section 5.29.030

F.
Code Limitations on Benefits. Benefits payable under the Plan to each highly compensated Employee, as defined in Code Section 414(q), are limited to the extent necessary to avoid violating the nondiscrimination requirements contained in Code Section 129.

Expenses and Compensation. Unless the County agrees otherwise, the Plan Administrator shall serve without compensation. The County shall pay all reasonable expenses the Plan Administrator incurs in performing its duties.
2.
Indemnification. The County shall indemnify and hold harmless any Employee, officer, or director who serves or served as Plan Administrator from all claims, liability, and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of being the Plan Administrator or performing the Plan Administrator's duties, except if the claim, liability, or cost is the result of such individual's willful misconduct or bad faith.
(Ord. 2008-0014 §§ 9, 10 (part), 2008.)
5.29.080 - Plan amendment or termination.
A.
Permanence of the Plan; Right to Terminate. The Plan shall continue in full force and effect unless amended or terminated by the County as provided in Section 5.29.080B.
B.
Plan Amendment or Termination to Amend or Terminate the Plan at Any Time. The County reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time.
C.
Effect of Amendment or Termination; No Vested Rights. No amendment or termination of the Plan shall have any retroactive effect so as to deprive any Covered Employee of any benefit then payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, amendment or termination of the Plan may be made retroactive to the extent necessary for the Plan to comply with any applicable law. No Covered Employee has any vested right to continue to receive benefits under the Plan.
(Ord. 2008-0014 §§ 9, 10 (part), 2008.)
5.29.090 - Miscellaneous provisions.
A.
No Employment Rights. Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any Employee, or as the right of any Employee to continue in the employment of an Employer, to be employed for any specific period of time.
B.
Exclusive Obligations and Rights. The County, an Employer, and the Plan Administrator do not have any obligation or duty other than as stated in the Plan and, except as specified in this document, no one has a right to Plan benefits or a legal or equitable right against the County, the Board of Supervisors, an Employer, the Plan, or the Plan Administrator.
C.
No Assignment of Benefits. Except to the extent required in accordance with applicable law, Plan benefits are not subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, levy or charge of any kind, and any attempt to effect any of these actions is void.
D.
Misrepresentation or Fraud. A Covered Employee who receives a Plan benefit as a result of false or incomplete information or a misleading or fraudulent representation shall repay all amounts the Plan paid and is liable for all collection costs including attorneys' fees and court costs.
E.
Legal Action.
1.
Exhaustion of Administrative Procedures. Before pursuing legal action, a person claiming Plan benefits or seeking redress related to the Plan shall first exhaust all claim, review and appeal procedures provided by the Plan. No action at law or in equity may be brought to recover Plan benefits or seek redress related to the Plan until the claim procedures contained in Section 5.29.060 have been exhausted.
2.
Necessary Parties. Unless otherwise required by law, the County and the Plan Administrator are the only necessary parties to any action or proceeding that involves the Plan or its administration. No Employee, Employer or other person or entity is entitled to notice of any legal action, unless a court with appropriate jurisdiction orders otherwise.
F.
Governing Law. The Plan's provisions and all Plan matters, including actions of the parties involved, are construed and enforced according to applicable California laws unless preempted by federal law.
G.
Governing Instrument. This writing, together with any documentation incorporated by reference, is the legal instrument governing the Plan. In case of conflict between this document and any of the writings incorporated by reference, the provisions of the documentation govern in the following order: this document, any other plan document, any summary plan description, any enrollment or election form and, finally, any other writing. No writing or evidence may contradict or interpret the Plan's terms or provisions unless specifically incorporated by reference herein.
H.
Savings Clause. If a Plan provision or its application is held invalid under governing law by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of the Plan and its application will not be affected.
I.
Parties' Liability. Neither the County, the Board of Supervisors, an Employer, the Plan Administrator, nor any delegate thereof, shall be liable for:
1.
good faith reliance on any fact or absence of fact, good faith action, or good faith omission,
2.
another person's act or omission, unless required by law, or
3.
the tax consequences of contributions to or benefits paid from the Plan.
J.
Tax Consequences Not Guaranteed. Neither the County, the Board of Supervisors, an Employer, the Plan, the Plan Administrator, nor any other person connected with any such person or entity guarantees that Plan benefits are or will be excludable from a Covered Employee's gross income for federal, state, or local income tax purposes, or that any other tax treatment is or will be applicable or available. Covered Employees themselves shall determine whether Plan benefits are excludable for these purposes, and shall notify the Plan Administrator if they have reason to believe a payment is not excludable. If the Plan Administrator determines at any time after the end of a Plan Year that contributions to the Plan or benefits paid exceeded limits allowed by law for any reason including, but not limited to, erroneous information, administrative error or failure to satisfy prohibitions on discrimination, then affected Covered Employees shall:
1.
pay any local, state, and federal income taxes and related penalties and interest due with respect to the excess contributions or benefits, and
2.
reimburse the Employer for the Employee's share of any local, state, and federal tax contributions the Employer would have withheld or other applicable deductions the Employer would have taken had the excess contributions or benefits been treated as taxable income.
K.
Nondiscrimination. If, in the judgment of the Plan Administrator, the Plan may fail to meet the requirements of Section 129(d) of the Code, the Plan Administrator will take such action as it deems appropriate to assure compliance with such requirements. The action taken by the Plan Administrator may include, without limitation, a modification of the elections of certain Covered Employees who are defined as "highly compensated employees" under Code Section 414(q). Such action may be taken by the Plan Administrator without consent of the affected Covered Employee.
L.
Participating Employers. With the County's consent, any Employer may adopt or withdraw from this Plan. Each Participating Employer shall file with the Plan Administrator a notice of adoption specifying:
1.
the effective date of its adoption, and
2.
any other information the Plan Administrator may require to carry out its duties under the Plan. Except for functions reserved to the County, the Plan Administrator has exclusive authority over all Plan matters and acts as agent of all Employers that have at any time adopted the Plan.
An adopting Employer may withdraw from Plan participation by giving the County and the Plan Administrator 60 days advance written notice of its withdrawal. Similarly, the County may terminate an Employer's Plan participation by giving the Employer and the Plan Administrator 60 days advance written notice of the termination. Upon an Employer's withdrawal or termination of participation, the Plan Administrator must provide the Employer with copies of all records that the Plan Administrator determines necessary for the Employer to terminate and administer its portion of the Plan. An Employer's withdrawal or termination of Plan participation operates only as to that Employer's Employees.
