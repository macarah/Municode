SECTION 325 - CLEARANCE OF BRUSH AND VEGETATIVE GROWTH
325.1 Electrical transmission lines.
325.1.1 Support clearance.
Any person owning, controlling, operating, or maintaining any electrical transmission or distribution line upon any mountainous, forest, or brush-covered lands, or land covered with flammable growth shall, at all times, maintain around and adjacent to any pole supporting a switch, fuse, transformer, lightning arrester, or line junction, or dead end, or corner poles, or towers, or other poles or towers at which power company employees are likely to work most frequently, an effective firebreak, consisting of a clearing of not less than 10 feet in each direction from the outer circumference of such pole or tower provided, however, that this provision shall not be deemed to apply to lines used exclusively as telephone, telegraph, telephone, or telegraph messenger call, fire or alarm lines, or other lines classed as communication (Class C) circuits by the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California. Nor shall this provision apply to clearance around poles supporting only secondary electrical distribution lines of 750 volts or less.
(Ord. 2010-0060 § 45, 2010.)
325.1.2 Line clearance.
Any person owning, controlling, operating, or maintaining any electrical transmission or distribution line upon any mountainous, or forest, or brush-covered lands, or lands covered with flammable growth shall maintain a clearance of the respective distances hereinafter in this section specified in all directions between all vegetation and all conductors carrying electrical current.
For lines operating at 2,400 volts or more, but less than 72,000 volts, four (4) feet;
For lines operating at 72,000 volts or more, but less than 110,000 volts, six (6) feet; and
For lines operating at 110,000 volts or more, ten (10) feet.
In any case, such distance shall be sufficiently great to furnish the required clearance from the particular wire or conductor at any position, of such wire or conductor at any temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit or less. Dead trees, old, decadent, or rotten trees, those weakened by decay or disease, and trees leaning toward the line, which may contact the line from the side or may fall on the line, shall be felled, cut or trimmed so as to remove the hazard.
(Ord. 2010-0060 § 45, 2010.)
325.1.3 Self-supporting aerial cable.
No clearing to obtain line clearance is required when self-supporting aerial cable is used except that forked trees, leaning trees, and other growth which may fall across the cable and break it, shall be removed.
EXCEPTION: Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to require any person to maintain any clearing on land where such person does not have the legal right to maintain such clearing, nor shall any provision of this ordinance be construed to require any person to enter upon or to damage property of another without the consent of the owner thereof. For further exceptions, see Title 14, California Code of Regulations, sections 1250-57 inclusive.
(Ord. 2010-0060 § 45, 2010.)
325.2 Structures.
325.2.1 Clearances.
Any person owning, leasing, controlling, operating, or maintaining any building, structure, or apiary upon or adjoining any mountainous, or forest or brush-covered land or land covered with flammable growth, and any person owning, leasing, or controlling any land adjacent to such structures, shall at all times:
1.
Place or store firewood, manure, compost, and other combustible materials a minimum of 30 feet from any building, structure, or apiary.
2.
Maintain around and adjacent to such building, structure, or apiary an effective fire protection or firebreak made by removing and clearing away, for a distance of not less than 30 feet on each side thereof, all flammable vegetation or other combustible growth. This includes ornamental plants and trees known to be flammable, including but not limited to, acacia, cedar, cypress, eucalyptus, juniper, pine, and pampas grass.
EXCEPTIONS:
1.
Ornamental plants and trees that are individually planted, spaced, and maintained in such a manner that they do not form a means of transmitting fire from native growth to the structure.
2.
Cultivated ground cover such as green grass, ivy, succulents, or similar plants provided that they are maintained in a condition that does not form a means of transmitting fire from native growth to the structure.
3.
When the fire code official or commissioner finds that because of extra hazardous conditions, a firebreak of only 30 feet around such building, structure, or apiary is not sufficient to provide reasonable fire safety, the person owning, leasing, controlling, operating, or maintaining the building, structure, or apiary shall maintain around or adjacent to any building, structure, or apiary an additional fire protection or firebreak made by removing all brush, flammable vegetation, or combustible growth located from 30 to 100 feet from such building, structure, or apiary, as may be required by the fire code official or commissioner. Grass and other vegetation located more than 30 feet from such building, structure, or apiary and less than 18 inches in height above the ground, may be maintained where necessary to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion.
4.
That portion of any tree which extends within 10 feet of the outlet of any chimney shall be removed.
5.
Maintain any tree adjacent to or overhanging any building, structure, or apiary free of dead wood.
6.
Maintain the roof of any building, structure or apiary free of leaves, needles, or other dead vegetative growth.
7.
Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to require any person to maintain any clearing on land where such person does not have the legal right to maintain such clearing, nor shall any provision of this ordinance be construed to require any person to enter upon or to damage property of another without the consent of the owner thereof.
(Ord. 2010-0060 § 45, 2010.)
325.2.2 Extra hazard.
The governing body finds that in many cases because of extra hazardous situations, a firebreak around buildings, structures, or apiaries of only 30 feet is not sufficient and that a firebreak of 50 feet or more may be necessary. If the fire code official or commissioner finds that because of the location of any building, structure, or apiary and because of other conditions, a 30-foot firebreak around such building, structure, or apiary as required by Section 325.2.1 is not sufficient, the fire code official or commissioner may notify all owners of the properties affected that they must clear all flammable vegetation and other combustible growth or reduce the amount of fuel content for a distance greater than 30 feet, but not to exceed 200 feet.
(Ord. 2010-0060 § 45, 2010.)
325.3 Notice to correct.
325.3.1 Contents of notice.
A notice to clear all flammable vegetation and other combustible growth for a distance greater than 30 feet shall be in writing and shall specify the exact distance from the structure that such vegetation and growth must be cleared.
(Ord. 2010-0060 § 45, 2010.)
325.3.2 Compliance with findings.
Within a reasonable time after receipt of the notice specified in Section 325.3.1, every person owning, leasing, controlling, or operating the building, structure, or apiary involved, and every person owning, leasing, or controlling any land adjacent to such building, structure, or apiary shall at all times maintain around and adjacent to such building, structure, or apiary an effective fire protection or firebreak made by removing and clearing away, for a distance not less than so determined, on each side thereof, all flammable vegetation or other combustible growth, except as otherwise provided in Section 325.2
(Ord. 2010-0060 § 45, 2010.)
325.3.3 Correction by fire code official or commissioner.
Any person who has received notice for having failed to meet any of the requirements specified in Sections 325.2.1, 325.2.2, 325.3.2, 325.10, 503.2.1, 2404.21, 3807.2, or 3807.3 and who is unable to comply with the requirements of such notice may request the fire code official or commissioner to correct the condition or conditions. The fire code official or commissioner may do so, provided that the person requesting such assistance agrees to pay the full cost thereof.
(Ord. 2010-0060 § 45, 2010.)
325.3.4 Notice of failure to correct.
In the event any of the conditions prohibited by Sections 325.2.1, 325.2.2, 325.3.2, 325.10, 503.2.1, 2404.21, 3807.2, or 3807.3 exist, the governing body may instruct the fire code official or commissioner to give notice to the owner of the property upon which such condition exists, to correct such prohibited condition, and if the owner fails to correct such condition, the governing body may cause the same to be done and make the expenses of such correction a lien upon the property upon which such condition exists. If it so instructs the fire code official or commissioner, the governing body shall designate the time and place of a hearing either before itself or before a referee appointed by it, and shall notify the fire code official of its action.
(Ord. 2010-0060 § 45, 2010.)
325.3.5 Mailing notice.
Upon receipt of a notice from the governing body of the time and place of hearing, and not less than 10 days before such hearing, the fire code official or commissioner shall mail a notice to the owners of the property, as their names and addresses appear from the last equalized assessment roll, or as they are known to the clerk of the governing body on which a firebreak is not maintained as required by Sections 325.2.1. 325.2.2, 325.3.2, 325.10, 503.2.1, 2404.21, or 3807.3 in substantially the following form:
