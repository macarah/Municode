Rule 20 - PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
Rules:

20.01 - Performance evaluation.
The performance of each employee in the classified service shall be evaluated by the appointing power in relation to standards for efficient performance of the work in accordance with these Rules.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
20.02 - Ratings.
A.
Ratings of efficiency of performance shall be made for permanent employees at least once each year, and for probationers by the end of the probationary period. A revised rating may be submitted by the appointing power at any time.
B.
Performance ratings, in whole or in part, singly or cumulatively, are not, in themselves, compelling or presumptive of any particular score, grade or ranking on any part of a competitive examination.
C.
When an employee terminates employment, his/her most recent rating on file shall be the rating of record, and no additional rating need be made unless the performance has changed to unsatisfactory or "Failed to Meet Expectations" for management appraisal and performance plan participants. If a new rating is to be given, the report must be made and mailed within 30 days of employee's date of termination.
D.
No rating need be made for temporary employees.
(Ord. 2007-0061 § 2 (part), 2007: § 4 (part), Board of Supervisors Amendment adopted 10/10/96: Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
20.03 - Minimum service for which a rating is required.
No rating based on less than 10 days' service need be made.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
20.04 - Rating standards.
Except for employees covered by Rule 20.11, overall ratings shall be expressed by the following terms:
A.
Permanent Employees.
1.
"Outstanding": all work performance is consistently above the standards of the position. A substantial part of the work performance exceeds supervisory and management expectations most of the time. Factual evidence must be presented in writing to substantiate this rating;
2.
"Very good": a substantial part of the work performance is well above the standards of performance required for the position and all other parts of the performance are at least "competent." Factual evidence must be presented in writing to substantiate this rating;
3.
"Competent": work performance is consistently up to or somewhat above the standards of performance required for the position. This is the performance which is expected of a trained and qualified employee;
4.
"Improvement needed": This rating indicates that:
a.
A significant part of the work performance is below the standard of performance required for the position, and
b.
It is reasonable to expect that the employee will bring performance up to acceptable standards.
Factual evidence must be presented in writing to substantiate this rating. When this rating is given a new evaluation must be made within a period not to exceed six months from the day on which the employee is served with the "improvement needed" evaluation, except that the rating period may be extended by the length of any approved leave during the six months. Such evaluation shall bear an overall rating other than "improvement needed." If no follow-up rating is submitted at the end of six months, the employee will revert to his/her immediately prior status. If an employee is absent from duty prior to the period while on approved leave prior to the completion of such six-month period, the appointing power may, with the approval of the director of personnel, evaluate the six-month period on the basis of actual service, exclusive of the time away on leave. If adequate justification is provided, and with the approval of the director of personnel, the requirement of a new evaluation bearing a rating of "competent" or "unsatisfactory" within six months may be waived for up to an additional six months;
5.
"Unsatisfactory": a substantial part of the work performance is inadequate and definitely inferior to the standard of performance required for the position. Factual evidence must be presented in writing to substantiate this rating. When this rating is given it must be accompanied by a discharge or reduction in those cases in which the employee is still in service.
B.
Probationary Employees.
1.
"Competent": work performance is equal to or above the standards of performance for the position. This rating carries with it the appointing authority's approval to make the appointment final and complete;
2.
"Unsatisfactory": work performance is inadequate and below the standards of performance for the position. Factual evidence must be presented in writing to substantiate this rating, which carries with it the appointing authority's decision not to approve final and complete appointment.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
20.05 - Departmental record of ratings.
Each appointing power shall maintain within the employing department complete and detailed records of all ratings made.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
20.06 - Copy delivered to the employee.
Whenever a rating is made, the appointing power shall deliver or mail a true copy of the full report to the employee being rated, noting on the report the date such a copy was delivered or mailed. The report shall be handed or mailed to the employee within 20 days from the date such report is presented to the employee for signature, unless a revised report is being prepared, in which case such revised report shall be handed or mailed to the employee.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
20.07 - Review.
The employee may, within 10 business days of receipt of the rating, review the rating with any of the persons who have signed the report.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
20.08 - Full reports required.
When an appointing power rates an employee "unsatisfactory" or "improvement needed," a copy of the full report with all supporting data shall be forwarded promptly to the director of personnel. (§ 4(a), Board of Supervisors Amendment adopted 9/29/88: Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
20.09 - Reconsideration of ratings.
Except for employees covered by Rule 20.11, the employee may initiate a timely grievance in accordance with the department's grievance procedure or through the grievance procedure contained in any memorandum of understanding in effect between the county and the certified employee organization for the classification in which the employee works, or any specified item or items of the report including the overall rating, except for an overall rating of "unsatisfactory." Upon completion of the grievance proceedings, the appointing power shall either approve the report as originally prepared or direct that a new report be prepared, and shall notify the employee of the decision. If, subsequent to a resignation, an employee who held permanent status receives a performance evaluation with an overall rating of "improvement needed" or "unsatisfactory," the employee may, within 10 business days after delivery or mailing a copy of the evaluation, request reconsideration of the rating by the director of personnel. This request must be in writing setting forth in detail all the reasons upon which the request is made. Upon receipt of the request, the director of personnel may deny the request, upholding the rating as prepared, or conduct a hearing from written materials. In no event shall the decision of the director of personnel affect the employee's resignation.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
20.10 - Records.
In all departments, the records, reports and other data relating to employee performance shall be open at all times to the inspection of the commission, the director of personnel, and the employee concerned, and/or the employee's authorized representative. Such authorization must be in writing. Nothing herein contained is to be construed to require disclosure of information which would otherwise be privileged or confidential as provided by the laws of this state.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
20.11 - Management appraisal and performance plan Tier I and Tier II participants.
For employees who are not in a bargaining unit certified by ERCOM and who are compensated under the management appraisal and performance plan, performance will be evaluated at the end of each performance period using a written performance plan approved by the appointing authority. For employees who are serving a probationary period subsequent to appointment to a position paid under the management appraisal and performance plan, an interim review of the participant's performance must be completed prior to completion of the probationary period. The performance rating plan shall be in a format approved by the director of personnel. Overall performance evaluation ratings shall be assigned according to the following categories:
A.
Permanent Employees.
1.
"Far Exceeded Expected Expectations." Recognizes exceptional, unexpected, and highly successful outcome of performance, special assignments, or unusual opportunities. Significantly exceeds performance requirements on all job responsibilities, job skills, expectations, and goals. Performance and quality of work are at such a high level that the manager is performing substantially beyond the scope normally expected of the present position. This rating category is reserved for recognition of extraordinary performance.
2.
"Exceeded Expectations." Performance exceeded most and met all other performance requirements on all job responsibilities, job skills, behaviors, expectations, and goals as defined in the performance plan.
3.
"Met Expectations." Performance met goals, behaviors, and expectations as defined in the performance plan.
4.
"Needs Improvement Meeting Expectations." Performance failed to meet some of the goals, behaviors, and expectations as defined in the performance plan. Performance or quality of work is slightly below the satisfactory level and must be improved to the level of "Met Expectations." This performance rating requires a remedial performance plan, and within six months, a review and rating of performance with an overall rating of other than "Needs Improvement Meeting Expectations."
5.
"Failed to Meet Expectations." Performance failed to meet most of the goals, behaviors, and expectations as defined in the performance plan. When employee receives this rating, the employee must receive a notice of reduction or discharge if still in County service in accordance with the provisions of Rule 18.
B.
Probationary Employees.
1.
A probationary employee may be rated "Far Exceeded Expectations," "Exceeded Expectations," "Met Expectations," or "Failed to Meet Expectations" as defined above.
2.
An overall rating of "Far Exceeded Expectations," "Exceeded Expectations," or "Met Expectations" as defined above, carries with it the appointing authority's approval to make the appointment final and complete.
3.
An overall rating of "Failed to Meet Expectations" as defined above carries with it the appointing authority's decision not to approve final and complete appointment followed by discharge or reduction in accordance with the provisions of Rule 18.
C.
Performance Rating Transition.
1.
Performance Evaluation. The last performance evaluation rating under Civil Service Rule 20.04, shall be used for all purposes on or after January 1, 1997 and continue only until a new performance rating is given under the management appraisal and performance plan. Performance evaluation ratings under Civil Service Rule 20.04 shall be treated as if they are the same as management appraisal and performance plan ratings as follows:
a.
Permanent employees.
EXPAND
"Outstanding" = "Far Exceeded Expectations"
"Very Good" = "Exceeded Expectations"
"Competent" = "Met Expectations"
  EXPAND
"Improvement Needed" = "Needs Improvement Meeting Expectations"
"Unsatisfactory" = "Failed to Meet Expectations"
  b.

"Unsatisfactory" = "Failed to Meet Expectations"
  D.

The participant will be allowed the opportunity to present to the appointing authority, in writing, factors pertinent to the request for review. The decision of the appointing authority shall be final.
