APPENDIX 1 - LEGISLATIVE HISTORY FOR ORDINANCE 1494
The provisions of Ordinance 1494, originally adopted on September 12, 1927, have been frequently changed and updated. Often, outdated material has not been repealed; instead, the provisions have been kept current by many detailed amendments. Present provisions are based on language set out in Ord. 5447, passed December 13, 1949, which amended Ord. 1494 in its entirety and initiated a new section numbering scheme, but which left unrepealed a group of earlier amendments, from Ord. 1525 to Ord. 5445; among these are early regulations for zoned districts. It is for these reasons that full legislative history notes are not given following the text of each section of Ord. 1494 set out in Title 22. Current amendments to maps for zoned districts are set out only in the complete Ordinance List and Disposition Table at Volume 8 of this code.
The table set out in this Appendix 1 attempts to include all ordinance information concerning each section number presently or formerly in Ord. 1494, although some information may be missing. Ordinances with earliest passage dates are listed before later ordinances and repealing ordinances have been supplied for continuity.

For example: Section X In 1494 (appeared in original Ord. 1494); amended by Ords. A; B; C; repealed by Ord. D.
Added by Ord. E; renumbered to be § XX by Ord. F. (Further data listed under Section XX.)
Section Y Added by Ord. G; amended by H, I.* (No record of repeal or renumbering.)
Section Z Renumbered from § P by Ord. Q (see entry under Section P for early history).
  *An asterisk means that information is missing, or that the particular section number has not been amended or kept current.
Beginning with Ord. 12377, ordinances adding or making changes to particular zoning sections are noted in the legislative history at the end of each section; repeal information continues to be maintained in this Appendix 1.
To find the location of a particular section of Ord. 1494 in Title 22, consult Appendix 2. For example: Section 22.20.170 derives from Ord. 1494 Section 212; then, consulting this Appendix 1, the entry under Section 212 shows all ordinances affecting that section since its enactment.
