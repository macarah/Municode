Chapter 21.24 - DESIGN STANDARDS
Parts:
Part 1 - ACCESS
Sections:

21.24.010 - General requirements—Determination of adequacy.
A.
Each street providing access to lots within a division of land shall connect directly or through one or more other streets to a highway which is shown on the Highways Plan and which is maintained and open to public travel. Each route of access to a highway which is shown on the Highway Plan shall be adequate to accommodate the composition and volume of vehicular traffic generated by the land uses which it serves.
B.
In determining the adequacy of a route of access, the advisory agency shall consider the potential for blockage of the route by flood, fire or landslide and the effect of such blockage on the safe evacuation of future users and occupants of the division and on the deployment of fire equipment or other services under emergency conditions. The advisory agency may disapprove a design which makes use of a residential street as a route of access to industrial, commercial or other divisions of land generating traffic which would conflict with the residential character of the street.
(Ord. 85-0168 § 1, 1985; Ord. 10485 § 2, 1972: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 40, 1945.)
21.24.020 - Restricted residential access.
A.
If a street or street system is restricted to a single route of access to a highway shown on the Highway Plan, except for a limited secondary highway, which is maintained and open to public travel, whether at the point of intersection with the highway or at some point distant from the highway, the street or street system shall serve not more than:
1.
150 dwelling units where the restriction is designed to be permanent and the street or street system does not traverse a wildland area which is subject to hazard from brush or forest fire;
2.
75 dwelling units where the restriction is designed to be permanent and the street or street system traverses a wildland area which is subject to hazard from brush or forest fire;
3.
300 dwelling units, where the restriction is subject to removal through future development.
B.
If the roadway paving on that portion of the street or street system forming the restriction is less than 36 feet in width and is not to be widened to 36 feet or more as a part of the development of the division of land, the permitted number of dwelling units shall be reduced by 25 percent if the pavement is 28 feet or more in width, and by 50 percent if the pavement is less than 28 feet in width. If the roadway paving on that portion of the street or street system forming the restriction is 64 feet or more in width and the restriction is subject to removal through future development, the permitted number of dwelling units may be increased to 600. In no event shall the pavement width be less than 20 feet. The provisions of this section shall not apply to divisions of land referred to in Section 21.32.040 to divisions of land approved pursuant to Section 21.32.080, or to minor land divisions.
(Ord. 85-0168 § 2, 1985; Ord. 10485 § 4, 1972: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 40.2, 1945.)
21.24.030 - Wildland access.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 21.24.020 and 21.24.190, the advisory agency may disapprove a design of a division of land which utilizes a cul-de-sac or branching street system or other single-access street or street system as the sole or principal means of access to lots within the division, where the forester and fire warden advises:
A.
That the street or street system will traverse a wildland area which is subject to extreme hazard from brush or forest fires;
B.
That the lack of a second route of access would unduly hinder public evacuation and the deployment of fire-fighting and other emergency equipment in the event of a brush or forest fire.
(Ord. 10485 § 3, 1972: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 40.1, 1945.)
21.24.040 - Modifications to access and frontage requirements.
The advisory agency may modify the requirements of Sections 21.24.010, 21.24.020, 21.24.190 and 21.24.290 where it finds that topographic conditions, title limitations, or the pattern of ownership or the state of development of parcels in the immediate vicinity of a division of land make the strict application of the provisions of these sections impossible or impractical and that the public health, safety and general welfare will not be adversely affected thereby.
(Ord. 10485 § 5, 1972: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 40.3, 1945.)
Part 2 - HIGHWAYS
Sections:

21.24.050 - Highways.
A.
Where the Highway Plan shows any highway so located that any portion thereof lies within any proposed division of land, right-of-way for such portion shall be provided within such division in the general location shown on the Highway Plan, unless the advisory agency finds that the Highway Plan will be so amended as to remove or change the location of any portion of such highway within the proposed division, or unless an exception is granted pursuant to Section 21.52.010.
B.
Where the advisory agency finds that the Highway Plan will be amended in the future to add or reclassify a highway so located that a portion thereof lies within a proposed division of land, right-of-way for such portion shall be provided within the division in a width and at a location deemed appropriate by the advisory agency.
(Ord. 89-0061 § 1, 1989: Ord. 85-0168 § 3, 1985: Ord. 9404 § 7, 1967: Ord. 9071 § 5 (part), 1966: Ord. 5345 § 1, 1949: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 41, 1945.)

(Ord. 89-0061 § 2, 1989: Ord. 85-0168 § 4, 1985: Ord. 11665 § 21, 1978: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 42, 1945.)
21.24.065 - Right-of-way and Roadway Width Requirements—Cross-section Diagrams.
A.
Each highway shall have a width of right-of-way, vehicular pavement, and sidewalk where a sidewalk is required, to conform to the following cross-sections and standards, or such other designs as approved by the Director of Public Works. The advisory agency may modify the requirements of this section as to highway widths if topographic features, title limitations, existing improvements, or safety considerations make such dedication impossible or impractical, provided the safety and convenience of bicyclists and pedestrians, including children, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities, are maintained.
B.
Width of Limited Secondary Highways. Where the advisory agency finds that the traffic or drainage conditions warrant, the area indicated by the asterisk in Diagram 3 shall be shown as a future or dedicated right-of-way If such finding is not made, said area shall be subject to the provisions specified by Section 22.48.115. Other yard requirements established by Chapters 22.20 through 22.40 of Title 22 shall be in addition to said provisions.
C.
Cross-sections—not to scale. (See Cross-section Diagrams for Section 21.24.065 on the following pages.)
(Ord. 2013-0001 § 2, 2013; Ord. 89-0061 § 3, 1989; Ord. 85-0168 § 5, 1985.)
21.24.070 - Part-width highways.
Any part-width highway, or any reservation therefor, lying along and abutting any boundary of a division of land shall have such a width as will conform to the lines shown on the Highway Plan covering the same portion of such division.
(Ord. 85-0168 § 6, 1985: Ord. 9071 § 5 (part), 1966: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 43, 1945.)
21.24.080 - Grade separation and bridge approaches.
A.
Wherever any highway within a division of land intersects any railroad, interurban, or streetcar right-of-way, and such highway is shown upon the Highway Plan, and provision is made in such plan for the location of a separation of grades at such intersection, the road layout of the division of land shall be such as to conform to such plan.
B.
Each lot abutting upon a proposed cut or fill necessary for the approach to such grade separation shall be given suitable access elsewhere.
C.
Wherever it is proposed to divide property abutting an approach to an existing or proposed bridge, the division shall be arranged so that any lot abutting such approach has suitable access elsewhere, and the street layout adequately provides for such approach.
(Ord. 85-0168 § 7, 1985; Ord. 9071 § 5 (part), 1966: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 44, 1945.)
Part 3 - LOCAL STREETS AND WAYS
Sections:

21.24.090 - Right-of-way and Roadway Width Requirements—Cross-section Diagrams.
A.
Each alley and street shall have a width of right-of-way, vehicular pavement, and sidewalk, where a sidewalk is required, to conform to the following cross-sections, as shown on the diagrams following this section.
B.
The advisory agency may modify the requirements of this section, provided the minimum width of the right-of-way is 40 feet, excluding alleys, the safety and convenience of bicyclists and pedestrians, including children, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities are maintained, and either of the following apply:
1.
The requirements of this section cannot be met or are unnecessary or impractical because of topographic features, title limitations, general plan or Community Standards District policies or requirements, existing patterns of development, or existing improvements or safety considerations; or
2.
The advisory agency finds that the standard street widths required by this section are not consistent with the design of an applicant's residential planned, density-controlled, or hillside management development.
C.
The cross-sections designated as "alternate" in the diagrams following this section shall apply to existing improved streets only if the advisory agency finds that:
1.
The standard cross-section is not necessary to provide for the safety and convenience of pedestrians, including children, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities;
2.
The alternate cross-section will not directly serve land zoned residential or commercial;
3.
Pedestrian-heavy institutional uses, including private schools, public schools, colleges, universities, parks, and post offices will not be served by the alternate cross-section;
4.
The alternate cross-section will not impact either existing or proposed bicycle facilities that are required by and/or consistent with, the County Bicycle Master Plan; and
5.
That the use of such alternate cross-section would be in keeping with the design and improvement of adjoining highways or streets.
D.
That position of a street marked with an asterisk (*) in the following diagrams may be counted as part of the net area of a lot or parcel of land. The line between that portion of a street marked with an asterisk (*) and the portion thereof not so marked shall be deemed to be the property line as the words "property line" are used in the Zoning Ordinance set out at Title 22 of this code, but this shall not permit any encroachment within any portion of such street by the underlying fee owner.
E.
Cross-sections—not to scale. (See Cross-section Diagrams for Section 21.24.090 on the following pages.)
(Ord. 2013-0001 § 3, 2013; Ord. 85-0168 § 8, 1985: Ord. 10485 § 11, 1972; Ord. 9086 § 1, 1966: Ord. 7634 § 4, 1959: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 54, 1945.)
21.24.100 - Street grades.
No highway or street shall have a grade of more than six percent, except for short stretches where the topography makes it impracticable to keep within such grade, and in no event shall the grade exceed 10 percent, except where evidence, which is satisfactory to the advisory agency, is given that a lower grade is not possible.
(Ord. 85-0194 § 3 (part), 1985; Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 55, 1945.)
21.24.110 - Right-of-way radius.
Intersections of road right-of-way lines, where one or both roads are local residential, shall be rounded with a curve having a radius of 13 feet, unless otherwise determined by the road commissioner. Intersections of road right-of-way lines, where both roads are shown as highways on the Highways Plan or one of the roads serves a commercial or industrial development, shall be rounded with a curve having a radius of 27 feet, unless otherwise determined by the road commissioner.
(Ord. 85-0168 § 9, 1985: Ord. 9721 § 5, 1969: Ord. 8822 § 2, 1965: Ord. 8792 § 2, 1965: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 57, 1945.)
21.24.120 - Future streets.
Wherever the advisory agency shall have determined that a street is necessary for the future division of property as shown on the tentative map, or for adjoining property, but that the present dedication and construction of such street is not warranted, the advisory agency may require that the location, width and extent of such street shall be shown on the final map or parcel map as a future street. No improvement of such future street shall be required of the subdivider.
(Ord. 85-0194 § 3 (part), 1985; Ord. 9071 § 5 (part), 1966: Ord. 5883 § 3, 1952: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 56, 1945.)
21.24.130 - Centerline curve radius.
On any street the centerline curve radius shall not be less than 100 feet, unless sufficient evidence is offered to the advisory agency by the subdivider to show that the 100-foot radius is not practicable.
(Ord. 85-0168 § 10, 1985: Ord. 85-0194 § 3 (part), 1985; Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 45, 1945.)
21.24.140 - Street intersection angle.
Except as provided in Section 21.24.060, any highway or street intersecting any other highway or street shall intersect it at an angle as nearly a right angle as practicable.
(Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 46, 1945.)
21.24.150 - Service roads or alleys required when.
A.
Whenever it is proposed to divide property abutting a major or secondary highway, a service road or other local street shall be provided unless the circumstances of such property or of adjoining property render it inadvisable or undesirable to provide access by such service road or other local street.
B.
Where a service road or local street is not required, the subdivider shall provide an alley at the rear of such lots unless the advisory agency finds such alley inadvisable, undesirable, detrimental to adjoining property, or contrary to the best community design.
(Ord. 9071 § 5 (part), 1966: Ord. 5345 § 2, 1949: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 50, 1945.)
21.24.160 - Alleys in congested districts.
The advisory agency may require that an alley be provided at the rear of all lots where property is to be used for multiple residential use (not including two-family use) or commercial or other less-restrictive uses.
(Ord. 9721 § 4, 1969: Ord. 9204 § 3, 1966: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 48, 1945.)

Where two alleys intersect, a cutoff of not less than 10 feet along each alley shall be provided.
(Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 49, 1945.)
21.24.180 - Turnarounds.
A.
A turning area shall be provided at the end of cul-de-sac streets and dead-end alleys. The advisory agency may require turnarounds:
1.
Upon the recommendation of the subdivision committee, at intermediate points on cul-de-sacs of more than 700 feet in length, and on other local streets where the distance between intersections exceeds 2,000 feet; and
2.
At the end of stub or dead-end streets or more than 300 feet in length where the future extension of the street is remote.
B.
All such turnarounds shall conform to the specifications of the road commissioner.
(Ord. 10485 § 6, 1972: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 47, 1945.)
21.24.190 - Cul-de-sacs—Length restrictions.
A.
Cul-de-sacs shall be not more than:
1.
500 feet in length, when serving land zoned for industrial or commercial use;
2.
700 feet in length, when serving land zoned for residential uses having a density of more than four dwelling units per net acre;
3.
1,000 feet in length, when serving land zoned for residential uses having a density of four or less dwelling units per net acre.
B.
This section shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of a division of land utilizing frontage on an existing cul-de-sac of more than the maximum permitted length nor shall it be construed to prohibit the advisory agency from reducing the length of a proposed cul-de-sac to less than the maximum length permitted by this section or requiring the elimination of a proposed cul-de-sac in order to provide for the efficient circulation of traffic, the future development of the neighborhood street system or the deployment of emergency services.
(Ord. 10485 § 7, 1972: Ord. 7634 § 3 (part), 1959: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 47.1, 1945.)
21.24.200 - Mobilehome divisions of land—Street and driveway standards.
Those streets, existing or proposed within or contiguous to a mobilehome division of land which are to be dedicated or offered to be dedicated for public use shall meet the standards outlined in Section 21.24.090. Driveways in such division shall have minimum widths of 30 feet. However, greater driveway widths may be required by the advisory agency if the design or magnitude of such division warrants the greater width.
(Ord. 85-0168 § 11, 1985: Ord. 11681 § 2, 1978: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 59, 1945.)
21.24.210 - Pedestrian Ways.
A.
Internal mid-block pedestrian ways. Except in the case of any reversion-to-acreage map, vacation map, or boundary-line map, a transverse pedestrian way with a minimum width of eight feet may be required through the approximate middle of each block having a length of more than 700 feet. No such pedestrian way shall have a grade exceeding 10 percent, provided that where one or more adequate stairways in such pedestrian way are made a part of the improvement thereof, the grade of such stairway may be as great as 50 percent.
B.
Maintenance. All pedestrian ways not within the road right-of-way shall be privately maintained either by a homeowners' association or by the property owners of properties adjoining the pedestrian way, the cost of which shall be shared equally. The maintenance requirement shall be set forth in a maintenance agreement, the terms of which shall be to the satisfaction of the Director of Regional Planning.
C.
Design standards. All pedestrian ways shall be designed to maximize pedestrian safety, security, and comfort, and shall include the following:
1.
Open public access, unless recommended otherwise by the County Sheriff, or unless the advisory agency determines that access to the pedestrian way shall be gated for safety reasons;
2.
Walls and/or fences if needed for safety or security, provided they allow for transparency;
3.
A paved surface that is a minimum of five feet in width;
4.
A landscaped strip, a minimum of four feet in width, adjacent to the pedestrian way;
5.
Tree plantings within the above landscaped strip at sufficient intervals to provide a continuous shade canopy;
6.
Lighting at sufficient intervals to illuminate the pedestrian way; and
7.
Any other appropriate measure as determined by the Director of the Regional Planning.
D.
Cul-de-sac through access.
1.
When cul-de-sacs are proposed for the development and where title considerations and/or topography otherwise allow, each cul-de-sac shall provide a pedestrian and/or bicyclist pathway or stairway, a minimum of eight feet in width, to connect to:
a.
Any highway, parkway, street, driveway, fire lane, or alley that adjoins any portion of any lot that fronts the cul-de-sac;
b.
Any existing or proposed trail located within 500 feet from any point on the cul-de-sac right-of-way;
c.
Any existing or proposed recreational facility located within 500 feet from any point on the cul-de-sac right-of-way;
d.
Any existing school located within one-quarter mile from any point on the cul-de-sac right-of-way; and
e.
Any existing commercial area located within one-quarter mile from any point on the cul-de-sac right-of-way.
2.
The through-access pathway or stairway required by this subsection shall be depicted on the tentative map or exhibit map showing an access and pathway/stairway construction easement or dedication, but when infrastructure improvements are required pursuant to this Title 21, a constructed pathway/stairway shall be depicted on the tentative map or exhibit map.
(Ord. 2013-0001 § 4, 2013; Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 51, 1945.)
21.24.220 - Fire-fighting access easements.
In areas where, in the opinion of the forester and fire warden, there will be fire hazard to the watershed or any other properties, unobstructed fire-protection access easements, not less than 15 feet wide, shall be dedicated from the public highway to the boundary of the division of land. Where the design of a division of land will cause an existing fire road or fire break to be severed, and the forester and fire warden advises that this condition will impair the provision of adequate fire protection, the advisory agency may require that the subdivider either revise the design of the division of land so that the fire road or fire break will not be severed or provide an alternate easement. The forester and fire warden shall recommend to the advisory agency regarding the location, design and grading of easements required pursuant to the provisions of this section. Such location, design and grading shall be as found necessary by the advisory agency.
(Ord. 10485 § 8, 1972: Ord. 9071 § 5 (part), 1966: Ord. 7634 § 3 (part), 1959: Ord. 4478 Art. 4 § 47.2, 1945.)
21.24.230 - Collector streets on section lines and quarter-section lines.
Collector streets shall be established on all section lines and quarter-section lines in the Antelope Valley, except on those lines designated as highways on the Highway Plan. The advisory agency may select a different location for such streets where existing conditions on the ground, ownership patterns, topography, environmental factors or other concerns warrant.
(Ord. 85-0168 § 12, 1985.)
Part 4 - LOTS
Sections:

21.24.240 - Area and width—Requirements generally.
A.
Each lot in any division of land shall have an area not less than either the required area or what will be the required area at the time of the submission of the final map or parcel map for approval for the zone in which the lot or any portion thereof is located. Each lot shall have an average width of not less than the required width, or what will be the required width at the time of the submission of the final map or parcel map for approval, or shall contain an area of not less than such required area within a portion which does have an average width of not less than such required width, except as provided in Sections 21.24.280 or 21.24.360 or 21.24.370. The required area and the required width shall be the same as those terms are defined, respectively, in the Zoning Ordinance set out at Title 22 of this code. Where the Zoning Ordinance does not establish a required area or a required width in a particular zone, the required area shall be 5,000 feet and the required width shall be 50 feet.
B.
If any lot is in more than one zone, then the area and width thereof shall be not less than the area and width requirements, respectively, in that zone in which any part of the lot is located which has the largest area requirement and in that zone in which any part of the lot is located which has the greatest width requirement.
C.
This section does not apply to any lot which the subdivider offers to deed or dedicate to the public.
D.
Where public sewers are not available and private sewage disposal is to be used, every lot or parcel or building site shall be of sufficient size to provide for satisfactory sewage disposal for the land use intended.
(Ord. 9071 § 5 (part), 1966: Ord. 7831 § 1, 1960; Ord. 7694 § 1, 1959; Ord. 7634 § 5, 1959; Ord. 7345 § 5, 1958; Ord. 6365 § 1, 1954: Ord. 6251 § 1, 1953: Ord. 4478 Art. 5 § 71, 1945.)
21.24.250 - Area and width—Sloping terrain.
A.
In lieu of compliance with subsection A of Section 21.24.240, the plan of subdivision may comply with the requirements of Section 21.24.260 if the advisory agency determines:
1.
That due to sloping terrain, the topographic features within the division of land will be better utilized if a portion of the lots in such division are less in area than the applicable designation;
2.
That a final map or parcel map of the division of land or any part thereof will not be filed unless the average area of all lots on such map or maps is not less than the applicable zoning designation;
3.
That the lots having a reduced area will be compatible in design to adjacent facing and siding lots of abutting development;
4.
That all lots which are not reduced in area shall comply with subsection A of Section 21.24.240.
B.
Lots which have been averaged in area with one or more other lots on a final map or parcel map in order to comply with the provisions of this section shall not be resubdivided or otherwise divided unless the advisory agency finds that the division will not reduce the average area of the lots resulting from the division and any remaining lots shown on the final map or parcel map below the applicable zoning designation.
(Ord. 9721 § 6, 1969: Ord. 9071 § 5 (part), 1966: Ord. 8042 § 1 (part), 1961: Ord. 4478 Art. 5 § 71.1, 1945.)
21.24.260 - Area and width—Reduced lot table.
When the advisory agency has made all of the findings listed in Section 21.24.250, not to exceed 43 percent of the lots in the division of land may have less than the required area if they all have an area and average width not less than that shown on the following table.
Reduced Lot Table
EXPAND
Zoning Designation Reduced Lots Min. Area Reduced Lots Min. Width
Less than 10,000 sq. ft. 7000 60′
10,000 sq. ft. to less than 15,000 sq. ft. 70% of zoning designation 70′
15,000 sq. ft. to less than 30,000 sq. ft. 70% of zoning designation 80′
30,000 sq. ft. or more 65% of zoning designation 100′
  (Ord. 9071 § 6, 1966: Ord. 8042 § 1 (part), 1961: Ord. 4478 Art. 5 § 71.2, 1945.)
21.24.270 - Area and width—Change of zone.
A.
If the advisory agency has approved and recommended to the board of supervisors a reduction of the required area or required width, or both, and is of the opinion there is a reasonable probability that prior to the submission of the final map for approval or the parcel map for filing with the county recorder, the required area or required width or both will be reduced by action of the board of supervisors, it may conditionally approve a tentative map having one or more lots with less than the required area or width, or both.
B.
Such approval of the tentative map shall not be effective unless and until the required area or required width or both are so reduced by the adoption of an ordinance by the board of supervisors and such ordinance has become effective and all lots in the division of land comply with Section 21.24.240, or with 21.24.240 as modified pursuant to Section 21.52.010.
(Ord. 9071 § 7 (part), 1966: Ord. 7694 § 2, 1959: Ord. 4478 Art. 5 § 71.5, 1945.)
21.24.280 - City boundary line to be lot line when.
No lot shall be divided by a city boundary line. Each such boundary line shall be made a lot line.
(Ord. 9071 § 7 (part), 1966: Ord. 7345 § 6, 1958: Ord. 4478 Art. 5 § 73, 1945.)
21.24.290 - Frontage for lots.
The alignment of streets shall be such as to provide frontage for lots in the division of land except as provided in Section 21.24.280.
(Ord. 9071 § 7 (part), 1966: Ord. 4478 Art. 5 § 72, 1945.)
21.24.300 - Minimum frontage.
Wherever practical, lot frontage at the right-of-way line shall be:
A.
40 feet or more, where a lot is oriented so that its side lot lines are radial or approximately radial to a turnaround or knuckle or to the convex side of a curved street centerline; and
B.

In all cases where practicable, the side lines of lots shall be at an approximate right angle to the street upon which such lots front.
(Ord. 4478 Art. 5 § 75, 1945.)
21.24.320 - Flag lots.
The advisory agency may disapprove the platting of flag lots where this design is not justified by topographic conditions or the size and shape of the division of land, or where this design is in conflict with the pattern of neighborhood development. If flag lots are approved, the access strip for each lot shall be at least 10 feet in width where the strip is situated contiguous to other such access strips, so as to form a common driveway, and at least 15 feet in width, where the strip is not situated contiguous to other such access strips, unless the subdivision committee recommends the approval of lesser widths because of topographic conditions or the size and shape of a division of land. Each access strip shall be located so that, when improved as a driveway, the finished grade will not exceed 20 percent. The advisory agency may require that easements for ingress and egress be provided over common driveways for the benefit of the lots served.
(Ord. 10485 § 13, 1972: Ord. 4478 Art. 5 § 72.2, 1945.)

21.24.340 - Residential Subdivisions�Local Park Space Obligation�Formula.
A.
The subdivider of a residential subdivision shall provide local park space to serve the subdivision, pay a fee in lieu of the provision of such park land in accordance with the provisions of Section 21.28.140, provide local park space containing less than the required obligation but developed with amenities equal in value to the park fee, or do a combination of the above in accordance with the requirements of this title. The extent of the local park space obligation to be satisfied by land, fees, land and amenities, or a combination of these, shall be determined by the following formula:
X = .003(UP)
Where:
X = Local park space obligation in acres.
U = Total approved number of dwelling units.
P = Column 1 for detached and attached single-family residences;
Column 2 for multi-family housing containing two to four dwelling units;
Column 3 for multi-family housing containing five or more dwelling units; and
Column 4 for mobile homes.

B.
The approved number of dwelling units within a subdivision shall be the number of dwelling units approved in the tentative tract, except that where topographic conditions, the design of the subdivision, dedications, agreements, or the restrictions of other ordinances, statutes or regulations will not, in the opinion of the advisory agency, permanently prohibit construction of dwelling units to the maximum permitted by zoning, the advisory agency may determine the maximum number of dwelling units which can be placed in such subdivision, and shall base the approved number of dwelling units within the subdivision on such maximum number.
C.
For purposes of this Title 21, "local park space" may include, but shall not be limited to: publicly or privately owned playgrounds, riding and hiking trails, tennis, basketball or other similar game-court areas, swimming pools, putting greens, athletic fields, picnic areas, and other types of natural or scenic areas as recommended by the director of parks and recreation for passive or active recreation.
D.
If the advisory agency determines that the strict application of the equation set forth in this section to a particular subdivision would result in an inequitable duplication of local park space previously provided by a subdivider or his predecessors in interest for the benefit of the land comprising the subdivision, or in a duplication of fees previously paid for the acquisition or development of such facilities, the advisory agency shall adjust the computation of required park space to the extent necessary to eliminate such duplication.
E.
The provisions of this section and of Sections 21.24.350 and 21.28.140 shall not apply to condominium projects which consist of the subdivision of air space in an existing residential building which is more than five years old (when no new units are added), or to single-family lots within a land division having a gross area 10 acres or larger.

21.24.350 - Residential subdivisions—Provision or local park sites.
A.
Upon ascertaining the local park space obligation to be fulfilled by the subdivider of a residential subdivision pursuant to Section 21.24.340, the advisory agency shall review the proposed subdivision, the park and recreational needs of the future inhabitants of the subdivision, and existing or potential neighboring park and recreational facilities to determine whether all or any portion of the local park space obligation should be satisfied by the provision of park space to serve the subdivision. If the advisory agency determines that park space should be provided, the advisory agency shall advise the subdivider of the design and location of such space.
B.
If the subdivision contains more than 50 lots, the subdivider shall provide the necessary park space as determined by the advisory agency. If such park space is less than the total park space obligation required by the provisions of Section 21.24.340, the subdivider shall pay the park fees, in accordance with the provisions of Section 21.28.140, provide amenities to the park space equal in value to the park fees, or do a combination of both.
C.
If the subdivision contains 50 or fewer residential lots, provision of the park space designated by the advisory agency shall be at the option of the subdivider. If the subdivider elects to provide the park space designated by the advisory agency, the amount of park space provided shall be credited against the local park space obligation for the subdivision. The residual obligation, if any, shall be satisfied by the payment of park fees in accordance with the provisions of Section 21.28.140, the provision of amenities to the park space equal in value to the park fees, or a combination of both. If the subdivider elects not to provide the local space designated by the advisory agency, the entire local park space obligation shall be met by the payment of park fees.
D.
Determinations as to whether park space should be provided, and as to the design and location of such space and any amenities thereof, shall be made in accordance with the principles and standards for local park and recreational facilities contained in the recreation element of the general plan, the additional provisions of this Title 21, and the recommendations of the director of parks and recreation. The subdivider shall install all improvements for streets abutting the park sites as required by this Title 21.
E.
1.
Each park site shall be physically suited for the use intended. Land which is made a part of a park site for subdivision design purposes, but which is physically unsuited for park use, shall be discounted when calculating the area of the park site provided pursuant to this section. The park space provided shall be calculated from the road right-of-way line and not from the centerline of an abutting street.
2.
Land intended for other than trail use shall have a maximum slope of three percent. If necessary, the site shall be graded by the subdivider to achieve this slope, in accordance with plans approved by the department of parks and recreation. However, land which has an average slope of more than three percent may be credited against the park dedication requirement where the director of parks and recreation finds that special circumstances exist which would make the acceptance of such land in the public interest. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of credit against the park obligation in such cases shall be calculated as follows:
EXPAND
Park Site Slope Credit Against Park Obligation
0—3% 100%
3.1—10% 87%
10.1—20% 56%
Over 20% 10%
  3.
Greater credit for sites in excess of three-percent slope may be given where the director of parks and recreation finds that a site contains an exceptional visual, biotic or other natural resource.
F.
If the board of supervisors determines that any of the proposed land to be provided is not suitable for park use, it may reject all or any portion of the offer to provide, and in that event the subdivider shall pay the appropriate fee in accordance with the provisions of Section 21.28.140.
G.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve the subdivider from providing park or recreational space required by the Zoning Ordinance set out at Title 22 of this code, or by the provision of variances or permits granted pursuant to the Zoning Ordinance, nor shall any provision of this section be construed to require the county to accept land for park purposes which is unsuited for park use.

Such alternate requirements which are intended to authorize that type of subdivision commonly designated as the "Radburn Plan of subdivision" are as follows:
1.
A complete system of pedestrian walks in front of the lots, separate from the streets, completely serving all lots in the subdivision in such a direct manner, particularly in relation to schools serving the subdivision, that there will be little inducement or necessity for pedestrians to walk in the streets;
2.
A system of short dead-end streets at the rear of the majority of lots, to discourage instrusion of through traffic which can be confined to the relatively few through streets from which these dead-end streets branch, and which bound the super-blocks thus formed;
3.
A system of continuous park, of such size, shape and arrangement as to be useful in part for recreation, and at least equal to 0.033 acre per lot within each super-block, adjacent to all lots or the walks immediately in front of such lots, and not separated from the lots by any street for vehicular use;
4.
Effective restrictions binding on and for the benefit of the tract as a whole and enforceable by the property owners as a whole, providing that the lots served only by such dead-end streets may be used for single-family residence only, and providing that all such houses will be so located that the garage is accessible directly from the street, and the principal entrance of the house is accessible directly from the walk, that adequate space between buildings will be maintained, and that buildings shall not cover more than 35 percent of the area of each such lot;
5.
Where economically proper and feasible, business properties and multiple-dwelling properties located only upon the through streets bounding the super-blocks and served by adequate automobile parking space either off the street or by special design of the street, and, in case of business properties, easily accessible from all parts of the tract by the system of walks above mentioned.
B.
Provided, that in no case shall any lot have an area of less than 4,000 square feet; that every through street shall have a width of not less than 60 feet; that every such dead-end street shall be entered directly from a through street, shall have an adequate turning area at the dead end, and shall have a width of not less than 34 feet; that vision clearance and curb construction at block corners be maintained as provided for in Section 21.24.110, even though the dedication lines so mapped may differ from the requirements of Sections 21.24.110 and 21.24.290; that in all cases of property fronting on such streets of reduced width or on walks, the distance between houses across such streets or walks shall be not less than 50 feet, and that where lots front upon such walks rather than upon streets, the side lines shall be, so far as practical, at a right angle to said walks instead of the streets.
(Ord. 85-0194 § 3 (part), 1985; Ord. 4478 Art. 5 § 76, 1945.)
21.24.370 - Divisions of land for purpose of lease only.
A.
The advisory agency may approve a tentative map of a division of land which does not comply in all respects with the requirements of Parts 1, 2 and 3 of this chapter if:
1.
The advisory agency finds:
a.
The division of land is for lease only,
b.
Because the lots are to be leased only and because of the situation and development or proposed development of the division of land and surrounding property, approval of the tentative map would not be detrimental to the public welfare or property of other persons in the vicinity thereof;
2.
On such tentative map, and on the final map or parcel map, there appear, in letters not less than one-fourth inch in height, the words: "DIVISION OF LAND FOR PURPOSE OF LEASE ONLY."
B.
A person shall not sell, mortgage, place a deed of trust or other lien upon any lot or other parcel in such division of land, or offer or contract to do so, unless such transaction would be in full compliance with all of the provisions of this Title 21 and the Subdivision Map Act had such final map or such parcel map not been filed.
C.
The filing of such final map or of such parcel map authorizes the leasing of any lot shown upon such map.
D.
Except that the lots in a division of land for lease only need not comply with the provisions of Section 21.24.240, this section does not modify in any way any requirements in the Zoning Ordinance or any other ordinance or law as to area or width requirements.
(Ord. 11127 § 1, 1975: Ord. 10486 § 8, 1972; Ord. 9071 § 7 (part), 1966: Ord. 7345 § 7, 1958: Ord. 4478 Art. 5 § 77, 1945.)
21.24.380 - Condominiums and Community Apartment Projects.
A.
In a division consisting of a condominium or a community apartment project, as defined in section 1351 of the California Civil Code, maps of such subdivisions need not, but may, show the design of the buildings and manner in which the buildings or the airspace above the property shown on the map are to be divided.
B.
Pedestrian access into or through the project area shall comply with the following:
1.
When serving residential uses:
a.
A common walkway a minimum of five feet in width shall be provided for direct access into the project site from any sidewalks along the project frontage. When such common walkway is located along a fire lane, a curb shall separate the fire lane from the walkway;
b.
If a project has a density of 12 or more dwelling units per net acre, a landscaped strip a minimum of four feet in width shall be provided along any common walkway that is adjacent to a fire lane. This landscaped strip shall be located between the common walkway and the curb to separate the fire lane from the walkway; and
c.
If direct vehicle access to the garage parking for any unit in the project is taken from a fire lane, the common walkway and/or main entrance to that unit shall be located along a landscaped common area or be accessible via a walkway from an adjoining street. In no case shall the primary pedestrian access to a unit be located along the fire lane. Any secondary pedestrian access to the unit may be located along the fire lane;
2.
When serving commercial and/or industrial uses, a common walkway a minimum of five feet in width with an adjoining landscaped strip a minimum of four feet in width shall connect all main building entrance(s) with the main entrances to all other on-site buildings, the on-site parking facilities, and any sidewalk(s) within or fronting the project area.
C.
Where a private driveway into or through the project area is required by the County Forester and Fire Warden to be designated a fire lane, any pedestrian access way along the fire lane, including pedestrian crossings, shall be clearly delineated on the tentative map or exhibit map.
D.
In all other respects, all of the provisions of this Title 21 shall apply to such a subdivision.
(Ord. 2013-0001 § 5, 2013; Ord. 11127 § 2, 1975: Ord. 9071 § 7 (part), 1966: Ord. 8500 § 2, 1963: Ord. 4478 Art. 5 § 79, 1945.)
21.24.390 - Mobilehome divisions of land.
A.
The advisory agency may approve a tentative map of a division of land which does not comply in all respects with the requirements of Parts 1, 2 and 3 of this chapter if:
1.
The advisory agency finds:
a.
The division of land is for mobilehome purposes only,
b.
The units of space proposed on the tentative map are for mobilehomes and related facilities only and the development of a mobilehome park on the property included within the division of land is in conformance with the Zoning Ordinance set out at Title 22;
2.
On such tentative map and on the final map or parcel map, there appear, in letters no less than one-fourth-inch in height, the words: "DIVISION OF LAND FOR MOBILE HOME PURPOSES ONLY."
B.
A person shall not use, lease, sell, mortgage, place a deed of trust or other lien upon a unit of space within a mobilehome division of land for any purpose other than a mobilehome and related facilities.
C.
Except that the units in a division of land for mobilehome purposes need not comply with the provisions of subsections A through D of Section 21.24.240, this section does not modify in any way any requirements in the Zoning Ordinance or any other ordinance or law as to area or width requirements.
D.
In a mobile home division of land, the owners of the units of space which are occupied by mobilehomes and which may also be occupied by accessory uses will hold an undivided interest in the common areas which will in turn provide the necessary access and utility easements for the units. A note to this effect is required on the final map or parcel map.
E.
Title to the units and common areas in a mobilehome division of land and control and maintenance of the common areas shall be similar to those for condominiums as contained in the Civil Code.
(Ord. 11681 § 3, 1978: Ord. 4478 Art. 5 § 77.1, 1945.)
21.24.400 - Division of land adjacent to existing roads.
A.
If the advisory agency finds that the proposed division of land abuts an existing road which has improvements insufficient for the general use of the lot owners in the division of land and local neighborhood and drainage needs, it may disapprove the design of the division unless the subdivider improves or agrees to improve such road to the same standards required of roads within all divisions of land by Chapter 21.32.
B.
Where a subdivider proposes to connect to an existing dead-end or cul-de-sac street in which a turnaround has been installed, the advisory agency may require the reconstruction of existing street improvements as a condition of such connection. If the subdivider makes or agrees to make the required improvements, all of the provisions of this Title 21 which apply to improvements and agreements to improve within a division of land shall apply.
(Ord. 85-0168 § 13, 1985; Ord. 12408 § 1, 1981: Ord. 10485 § 14, 1972; Ord. 9204 § 4, 1966; Ord. 9071 § 7 (part), 1966: Ord. 7912 § 1, 1961: Ord. 4478 Art. 5 § 78, 1945.)
21.24.410 - Coastal development permit required.
When a subdivision lies within the boundaries of the coastal zone, as defined in Section 30103 of the Public Resources Code, the subdivider shall apply for a coastal development permit concurrently with the tentative map. The advisory agency shall approve a tentative map only if a coastal development permit has been approved for the land division.
(Ord. 89-0147 § 7, 1989.)
21.24.420 - Low Impact Development.
