5.33.030 - Participation.
A.
Commencement of Participation. Each person employed by the County who is an Eligible Employee on February 28, 1989 shall become a Participant pursuant to the following:
1.
Each person who is an Eligible Employee on February 28, 1989 and who is enrolled in a Medical Insurance Plan as of February 28, 1989, shall become a Participant on the Effective Date. Any other person who is an Eligible Employee on February 28, 1989 shall become a Participant on the Effective Date provided he completes the election procedure set forth in Section 5.33.060A.
2.
Each person who becomes an Eligible Employee after February 28, 1989, and who, as of the date he becomes an Eligible Employee, is enrolled in a Medical Insurance Plan, shall become a Participant on the earlier of (a) the first day of the calendar month next following the first date he becomes an Eligible Employee and completes the election procedure set forth in Section 5.33.060A; or (b) the first day of the calendar month next following the ninetieth day after the first date he becomes an Eligible Employee.

B.
Effect of Participation. Eligibility to participate in the Plan shall entitle all Eligible Employees and Participants to select Benefits before such Benefits become currently available to them during the whole or part of a Plan Year, from among the Benefits included under the Plan for such Plan Year, and then only to the extent provided herein. Participation in the Plan shall not be deemed or construed in any manner whatsoever as entitling any Participant to receive any Benefit now existing or hereafter adopted by the Board absent such Participant meeting the eligibility and participation requirements of such Benefit.
C.
Termination of Participation. Participation in the Plan shall terminate when the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Employee; provided, however, that any provisions relating to a particular Benefit, as set forth herein or in the Materials, which continue the right of the Participant to receive such Benefit shall apply although he is no longer an Eligible Employee. When a person terminates participation in the Plan, but continues to be an employee of the County eligible for part or all of the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits to which he was entitled immediately prior to such termination, he shall be deemed to have authorized the County to convert his Elective Contributions, if any, to employee payroll deductions, or to otherwise initiate employee payroll deductions, as required, to continue such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits. Such payroll deductions may be adjusted from time to time by the County in accordance with any increases or decreases in the cost of the Taxable Benefits or Nontaxable Benefits.
D.
Participation Following Previous Termination. After a termination of participation in the Plan pursuant to subsection C of this section, the subsequent participation of any person who again becomes an Eligible Employee shall occur at the time and in the manner set forth in subsection A of this section.

This provision shall not apply to participants who decline coverage and have enrolled in an individual health insurance plan prior to January 2014.
5.
In addition to these monthly Nonelective Contributions, the County shall make two ad hoc Nonelective Contributions on behalf of each Participant in an amount equal to $250 on each of the March 28, 2014 and July 30, 2014 pay dates.
6.
No Nonelective Contribution shall be contributed for any Participant if he has not been in a pay status for at least eight hours during the prior month. Nonelective Contributions shall be reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the requisite pay status was completed. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Executive Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, an advance of approximately one-half the monthly Nonelective Contributions received as additional Eligible Earnings in accordance with Section 5.33.050F shall be reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the thirtieth day of the month in which the requisite pay status was completed and the remainder of such additional Eligible Earnings shall be reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the requisite pay status was complete.
B.
Elective Contributions. Each Eligible Employee prior to commencing his participation in the Plan and each Participant prior to the beginning of a Plan Year may irrevocably elect to have an additional dollar amount contributed by the County during a Plan Year for each month that he participates in the Plan as an Elective Contribution, not to exceed his Eligible Earnings for such month, and to have his Eligible Earnings reduced each month by an amount equal to such Elective Contribution; provided, however, that no Elective Contribution shall be contributed for any Participant if he has not been in a pay status for at least eight hours during the prior month. Such Elective Contribution on behalf of a Participant each month shall equal the amount necessary to fund the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits chosen by such Participant pursuant to the election procedures set forth in Section 5.33.060, after first applying the Nonelective Contribution for such month to the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits. In the event of contractual renegotiation, change in method of funding, or substitution of a Taxable Benefit and/or Nontaxable Benefit during a Plan Year, the County, without prior notice to Participants, may automatically adjust the Elective Contributions made for, and/or the Eligible Earnings paid to, Participants who have selected such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits, in accordance with increases or decreases in the cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, monthly Elective Contributions shall be apportioned over semi-monthly pay periods so that approximately one-half the monthly Elective Contributions shall be deducted from the Participant's Eligible Earnings as reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the thirtieth day of the month to which the Eligible Earnings relate and the remainder of the monthly Elective Contributions shall be deducted from the Participant's Eligible Earnings reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the fifteenth day of the following month.

The cost of a Taxable Benefit shall be treated as being paid to the Participant as cash and then deducted from his earnings and contributed to the Plan on an after-tax basis in an amount equal to the cost of the cost of that Taxable Benefit as determined pursuant to Section 5.33.050D. Eligibility to receive or waive any particular Taxable Benefit by a Participant shall require satisfaction of all waiting periods, eligibility rules, election requirements and other requirements and conditions which are set forth in the Election Information or the Materials and which are applicable to him and his employment and relate to such Taxable Benefit.
C.

Said certification shall be made in a manner determined by the County.
D.
Deletions, Additions and Changes in Taxable Benefits and Nontaxable Benefits. The Board in its sole discretion shall designate the Taxable Benefits and Nontaxable Benefits available under the Plan in respect of any Plan Year.

The County shall notify Participants in writing prior to the commencement of a Plan Year as to any (a) Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit deletions or additions under the Plan; (b) changes in the amount of Contributions required in payment of any Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit or changes in the method of funding or payment of any Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit to the extent such changes are known prior to the commencement of a Plan Year; and (c) modifications in the terms and provisions of any Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit.
E.
Benefit Cost Determination. The County shall determine the cost, in dollars, to be charged to a Participant to receive a Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit. In determining the cost of a particular Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit for each Plan Year, the County shall consider such factors as it determines to be appropriate, including but not limited to, the cost of purchasing insurance, if applicable, to provide such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit or the out-of-pocket expenses likely to be incurred by the County to provide the same, together with an appropriate amount of administrative expenses incurred in providing such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit. The cost of receiving a particular Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit available in the Plan Year may vary among different classes of Participants who are similarly situated with respect to such factors as number of dependents, age, salary level and length of service, and may be increased or decreased during a Plan Year pursuant to the renegotiation of the group insurance contract providing such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit, the substitution of a comparable Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit, or a change in the method of funding such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit. Such costs shall be disclosed to Eligible Employees and Participants in writing prior to or contemporaneously with the distribution of election forms for the Plan Year as provided by Section 5.33.060A, and any increase or decrease during the Plan Year in the cost of a Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit shall be disclosed to Participants as soon as reasonably possible.
F.
Cash Benefit.

Each Eligible Employee prior to commencing his participation in the Plan and each Participant prior to the beginning of a Plan Year shall elect the types of Taxable Benefits or Nontaxable Benefits to be received under the Plan during the course of such Plan Year. The form and content of the election form shall be such as the County shall from time to time determine to be appropriate. All election forms shall be due and returnable to the County on or before such date as the County may specify, which date shall be no later than the day prior to the commencement of the Plan Year to which such forms relate, or in the case of Eligible Employees, the day prior to the commencement of participation.
B.
Deemed Elections. Any Eligible Employee who is enrolled in a Medical Insurance Plan on the date his election form is due to be filed pursuant to subsection A of this section, or any Participant who in the current Plan Year receives one or more Taxable Benefits or Nontaxable Benefits who fails to make a timely election of Benefits for either initial participation or continued participation in the Plan, whichever is relevant, shall be deemed to have elected to receive the same type, and if applicable, the same amount, of Taxable Benefits or Nontaxable Benefits elected for the period preceding Plan participation or for the previous Plan Year. To the extent that the dollar value of the Nonelective Contribution made on behalf of such Participant exceeds the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits, the Participant shall receive the difference in additional monthly Eligible Earnings during the Plan Year. To the extent that the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits exceeds the Nonelective Contributions, the Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the County to reduce his Eligible Earnings by such amount each month as may be necessary to cover the excess cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits, in accordance with the limit set forth in Section 5.33.040B. Any Participant who fails to submit the election form on or before the due date who was not enrolled in an insured health or welfare benefit program incorporated into the Plan as a Taxable Benefit and/or Nontaxable Benefit shall be deemed to have elected to receive the entire amount of the Nonelective Contributions made on his behalf during the next Plan Year as additions to his Eligible Earnings each month during such Plan Year. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented: 1) any additional monthly Eligible Earnings received due to a Participant's deemed election under this Section 5.33.060B shall be reflected in County payroll warrants as described in Section 5.33.040A, and 2) a Participant's deemed authorization to have his monthly Eligible Earnings reduced shall include an authorization to have such reduction apportioned over County payroll periods and warrants as described in Section 5.33.040B.

Irrevocability of Elections. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, all elections made by or on behalf of Participants pursuant to subsections A and B of this section shall be irrevocable for the Plan Year for which made or deemed to be made.
D.
Election Changes During the Plan Year. In the event of an extraordinary change in a Participant's circumstances, and in accordance with any applicable regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 125 of the Code, the County, in its sole discretion, may permit such Participant during the Plan Year to change the type and/or amount of Benefits to be received under the Plan for the remainder of such Plan Year.
E.
Amnesty for Ineligible Dependents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, the County shall provide amnesty from discipline and payment recovery to any employee whose Ineligible Dependent(s) are removed from County-sponsored or County-approved health plan coverage as a consequence of a dependent eligibility verification process authorized by the CEO; provided, however, that no such amnesty shall be extended to any employee who obtains such coverage through willful misrepresentation or other fraudulent means.
F.
Compensation Reduction Agreement. If, in respect of any month during a Plan Year, the cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Non-taxable Benefits elected by a Participant for such Plan Year exceeds the amount of Non-elective Contributions made on his behalf for such month, the Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the County, in accordance with the limit set forth in Section 5.33.040B hereof, to reduce his Eligible Earnings by such amount each month as is necessary to cover the excess cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Non-taxable Benefits elected by such Participant and to make corresponding Elective Contributions to the Plan on his behalf. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, a Participant's deemed authorization to have his monthly Eligible Earnings reduced shall include an authorization to have such reduction apportioned over County payroll periods and warrants as described in Section 5.33.040B.
G.
Participant Accounts. The County shall establish and maintain appropriate procedures and records with respect to Benefit elections and Contributions made by and on behalf of Participants pursuant to subsections A and B of this section. The County may establish one or more accounts for each Participant for the purpose of recording such Participant's utilization of particular Taxable Benefits and/or Non-taxable Benefits, such as uninsured health care or dependent care reimbursement benefits if available, to which specific dollar amounts of Non-elective and/or Elective Contributions have been credited. In no event, however, shall such accounts represent actual deposits of Contributions into any fund, nor shall any interest be credited with respect to such accounts.
H.
Forfeiture of Unused Benefits. Any amount which a Participant has elected to receive during the Plan Year as a specific Taxable Benefit or Non-taxable Benefit pursuant to the election procedure set forth in subsections A and B of this section which remains unused by the Participant at the close of the Plan Year shall be forfeited to the County; provided, however, that payments of such amount may be made to the Participant up to six months beyond the close of a Plan Year so long as such payments are made under the provisions of such specific Taxable Benefit or Non-taxable Benefit for expenses incurred by the Participant during the Plan Year; provided further that up to $500 of unused amounts credited to a Participant's Health Care Spending Account may be carried over to the next Plan Year in accordance with the rules set forth in Section 5.35.030.
