Chapter 2.205 - TRANSITIONAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES PREFERENCE PROGRAM
Sections:

2.205.010 - Introduction.
The Board of Supervisors finds that it is of benefit to the County of Los Angeles to promote and facilitate businesses that distinguish themselves by accounting for their measurable social, public health and environmental impact. Social Enterprises, which include nonprofit and for-profit businesses often incur higher operating costs providing supportive services. Therefore, Social Enterprises are at a competitive disadvantage in obtaining County contracts, in which estimated cost is a significant factor.
(Ord. 2016-0036 § 1, 2016: Ord. 2007-0013 § 1 (part), 2007.)
2.205.020 - Purpose.
The County of Los Angeles Social Enterprise Preference Program is a race and gender-neutral program designed to establish a purchasing and contracting preference for certified Social Enterprises that provide transitional and permanent employment, to a Transitional Workforce or provide social, environmental and/or human justice services. The Social Enterprise Preference Program is designed to promote and foster inclusiveness and economic development, as well as ongoing evaluation to assure that all businesses, including Social Enterprises are provided equal opportunities in County purchasing and contracting activities.
