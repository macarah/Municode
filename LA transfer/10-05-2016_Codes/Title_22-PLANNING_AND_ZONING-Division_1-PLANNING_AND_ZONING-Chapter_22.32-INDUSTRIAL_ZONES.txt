The proposed use will detrimentally affect zoned aircraft uses, other heavy uses, or unzoned lawful aircraft uses; or
3.
Zoned aircraft uses, other heavy uses, or unzoned lawful aircraft uses would detrimentally affect the proposed use.
B.
Every conditional use permit granted for projects located in Zone M-2.5 shall, in addition to any other conditions which may be imposed, contain conditions which will prevent the authorized use from detrimentally affecting or being detrimentally affected by any zoned aircraft use, other heavy use, or any unzoned lawful aircraft use.
C.
A conditional use permit shall be of no force or effect until all persons having any right, title or interest in the property for which such permit is granted, or any portion thereof, execute and record with the Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk an instrument reading substantially as follows:
"Whereas we have sought and have been granted a conditional use permit, permitting the use of the following described property (name of use permitted) to wit, (describe property); and
"Whereas the whole of the said property (or a substantial portion thereof, if that be the fact) is in the unincorporated area of the County of Los Angeles and in Zone M-2.5, under this Title 22, the Zoning Ordinance, which zone is designed to be used for the operation of large airports, aircraft manufacturing plants, aircraft modification, overhaul or repair plants, aircraft power plant testing stations, or other heavy industrial uses which cause loud noises, heavy vibrations, or other conditions which may be very detrimental to other trades and industries, and as a buffer zone for certain unzoned lawful aircraft uses referred to in this Title 22; and
"Whereas we have assured the County of Los Angeles that such heavy industrial uses will not be in any way detrimental to the use requested by us;
"NOW, THEREFORE, as a condition (or one of the conditions) of the granting of said conditional permit, we hereby covenant and agree, both for ourselves and for our successors in interest, and assigns, that we will not, nor will any of us or any of our successors in interest, or assigns, seek damages for, or attempt to enjoin or complain of, the reasonable and necessary operation of any use permitted in Zone M-2.5, or of any unzoned lawful aircraft use and which use is not in violation of this Title 22, or of any other ordinance or law."
D.
The execution of, or promise to execute, such instrument may be deemed to be evidence that zoned aircraft, other heavy uses permitted in Zone M-2.5, or unzoned lawful aircraft uses, will not detrimentally affect such use.

The Manufacturing—Industrial Planned Zone (MPD) allows for intensive manufacturing, mineral extraction and refining, processing, assembly, research, wholesale, and storage uses, trucking terminals, railroad and freight stations, and similar activities that require separation from residential uses due to noise, vibration, odors, or other negative characteristics. This zone also accommodates warehousing, distribution and port-related uses. With the exception of accessory retail and service and ancillary office uses serving local employees and visitors, there shall be no new commercial uses within buildings constructed in this zone after the effective date of this ordinance amendment.

Any use permitted in Zone SR-D, and any nonresidential use permitted in Zone R-A under the same limitations and conditions, including auxiliary and transitional uses, front, side and rear yards, parking standards, height limits, and other development requirements specified in the respective zones.
B.
If a conditional use permit has first been obtained as provided in Part 1 of Chapter 22.56, property in Zone MPD may be used for a planned industrial development in which the Hearing Officer or the Commission may approve any use permitted in Zone M-1.5, subject to all of the following provisions:
1.
Area. The proposed development plan shall include a parcel of land having, as a condition of use, not less than five acres. A development plan may be considered on a parcel of land less than five acres in area when such property is located in Zone MPD and has a common boundary with property which has been developed under an approved plan pursuant to this subsection B. In such case, the plan shall indicate that the proposed development will constitute an orderly extension in arrangement of buildings, facilities, and improvements throughout the combined parcels of land in addition to all the other requirements for approval of a conditional use permit.
2.
Compatibility. The proposed development, including the specific industrial uses proposed, shall not be in conflict with the objectives of the general plan for the area.
3.
Design. The structural improvements shall not detract from the established or anticipated character of the surrounding area, as indicated by schematic drawings and renderings to scale showing the architectural design of buildings and structures to be established.
4.
Access and Parking. Adequate provision shall be made for vehicular access, parking, and loading so as to prevent undue traffic congestion on adjacent streets or highways, particularly local streets.
5.
Building Density. The floor area ratio shall not be greater than 1.0, and the ground-floor area of buildings shall not exceed 60 percent of the gross area of the lot or parcel of land on which the buildings are located. This does not permit a reduction in the parking requirement specified in this Title 22. In calculating "gross area," any streets or highways on the perimeter of the parcel of land, or any major or secondary highway or parkway that traverses the property, or any area which is required to be dedicated or a private easement given for any such street or highway, shall be excluded.
6.
Utilities. The applicant shall submit to the Hearing Officer or the Commission, and it shall be made a condition of approval, satisfactory evidence that the applicant has made arrangements with the serving utilities to install underground all new facilities necessary to furnish service in the development. This requirement may be waived where it would cause undue hardship or constitute an unreasonable requirement.
7.
Signs. The Hearing Officer or the Commission, in granting the conditional use permit, may allow signs which it finds will be in keeping with the concept of planned development.
8.
Development Features. The development plan shall include yards, walls, walks, landscaping, and other such features as may be needed to make the industrial development attractive, adequately buffered from adjacent more restrictive uses, and in keeping with the established or anticipated development of the surrounding area.
9.
Development Schedule. The Hearing Officer or the Commission shall approve a progress schedule, including all phases of development, and indicating that the improvements described in the development plan will be made prior to occupancy of industrial buildings. The Hearing Officer or the Commission may modify without a hearing this condition pertaining to the development schedule based upon an affirmative showing, in writing, of hardship.
10.
Tentative Subdivision Map. If subdividing property for the project, a tentative map shall be filed and made a condition of approval.
C.
If a conditional use permit has first been obtained as provided in Part 1 of Chapter 22.56, premises in Zone MPD may be used for child care centers.
