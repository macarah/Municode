Chapter 2.170 - REQUESTS FOR COUNTY RECORDS
Sections:

2.170.010 - Fees for providing county records.
A.
Whenever a request for copies of county records reasonably describes an identifiable record subject to disclosure, that record shall be provided to the requestor in accordance with the California Public Records Act for a fee which covers the direct costs of duplication as determined by the auditor-controller.
B.
Whenever a request for copies of county records subject to disclosure describes the records sought by listing categories of records related to a particular matter, issue or subject, or otherwise does not reasonably describe an identifiable record, the requestor shall reimburse the county for the costs incurred by the county in responding to the request as set forth in subsection C of this section.
C.
For requests for county records as described in subsection B of this section, the requestor shall be charged a fee for the actual duplication of the records which is the same as that set forth for the records described in subsection A of this section. In addition, the requestor shall be charged a fee of $22.50 for each hour of time expended by county employees to locate, retrieve and refile such records; provided, however, the first full hour of such time expended on all requests of any one requestor each month, shall be provided free of charge.
D.
If it is anticipated that the fee to be charged for the provision of any county records described in this section will exceed $50.00, a good faith estimate of the total fee to be charged shall be provided to the requestor, and the requestor shall make payment of such amount to the county before work is commenced on the request. Any overpayment or underpayment shall be reconciled at the time the records are provided to the requestor.
