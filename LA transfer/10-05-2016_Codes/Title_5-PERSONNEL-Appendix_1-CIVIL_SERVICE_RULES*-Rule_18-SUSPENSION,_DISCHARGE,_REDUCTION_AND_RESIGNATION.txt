Rule 18 - SUSPENSION, DISCHARGE, REDUCTION AND RESIGNATION
Rules:

18.01 - Suspension.
A.
Subject to such appeal right as provided in this Rule, an employee may be suspended by the appointing power for up to and including 30 days, pending investigation, filing of charges and hearing on discharge or reduction, or as a disciplinary measure. Where the charge upon which a suspension is the subject of criminal complaint or indictment filed against such employee, the period of suspension may exceed 30 calendar days and continue until, but not after, the expiration of 30 calendar days after the judgment of conviction or the acquittal of the offense charged in the complaint or indictment has become final. The reason(s) for such suspension shall be forthwith furnished in writing to the employee and a copy sent to the director of personnel.
B.
An employee who is suspended shall be entitled to answer, explain or deny the charges in writing within 10 business days. A copy of the answer shall be sent to the director of personnel and filed as part of the employee's record.
C.
An employee who is suspended for up to five days may appeal such suspension to the director of personnel. Any such appeal must be in writing, shall contain specific detailed information, and must be received by the director of personnel within 15 business days of the employee's notification of the suspension. The director of personnel may not consider any information or charges made by the appointing power unless they are contained in the letter of suspension, nor any made by the employee unless the employee has previously provided them to the appointing power for consideration, unless such information or charges were not then known and could not have reasonably been expected to be known by the appointing power or employee. The director of personnel shall determine whether or not to consider the appeal, or whether or not the suspension is justified.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
18.02 - Discharge or reduction.
A.
A permanent employee in a nonsupervisory class, a supervisory class in a bargaining unit as certified by ERCOM, or a managerial class in the Sheriff, may be discharged from county service or reduced in rank or compensation, and a permanent employee in all other supervisory classes and all other managerial classes may be discharged from county service or reduced in grade or compensation, after appointment or promotion is complete, and after completion of the employee's first probationary period (except as provided in Rule 18.06). Before such discharge or reduction shall become effective, the employee shall receive a written notice from the appointing power of intent to invoke discharge or reduction, and specific grounds and particular facts therefor. The employee shall then be allowed a reasonable time, not to exceed 10 days, to respond orally or in writing to the appointing power before the discharge or reduction shall become effective.
B.
When a permanent employee is discharged or reduced, the employee shall be allowed 15 business days from date of service of said notice of discharge or reduction in which to reply thereto in writing and request a hearing before the commission. Notice of the time allowed for answer and for requesting a hearing before the commission shall be stated in the notice of discharge or reduction. The appointing power shall submit to the commission evidence showing that the employee has been served with the notice of discharge or reduction either personally or by certified or registered mail addressed to the employee's last known address, and the date of such service.
C.
The commission may not consider any information or charges made by the appointing power unless they are contained in the letter of discharge or reduction, nor any made by the employee unless the employee has previously provided them to the appointing power for consideration, unless such information or charges were not then known and could not reasonably have been expected to be known by the appointing power or the employee. The commission shall determine whether or not the discharge or reduction is justified.
1.
In the case of employees in nonsupervisory classes, supervisory classes in bargaining units as certified by ERCOM and managerial classes in the Sheriff, the civil service commission may not consider any information or charges made by the appointing power unless they are contained in the letter of discharge or reduction, nor any made by the employee unless the employee has previously provided them to the appointing power for consideration, unless such information or charges were not then known and could not reasonably have been expected to be known by the appointing power or the employee. The commission shall determine whether or not the discharge or reduction is justified.
2.
In the case of employees in all other supervisory and all other managerial classes, the commission may not consider any charges made by the appointing power unless they are contained in the letter of discharge or reduction, nor any response or affirmative defense made by the employee unless the employee has previously provided them to the appointing power for consideration, unless such affirmative defenses were not then known and could not reasonably have been expected to be known by the appointing power or the employee. The commission shall determine whether or not the discharge or reduction is justified.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
18.03 - Hearing on reasons for discharge or reduction.
If the permanent employee to be discharged or reduced pursuant to Rule 18.02 so requests, the commission shall proceed in accordance with Rule 4.06. A public hearing pursuant to Rule 4 shall be held by the commission or by the hearing board.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
18.031 - Discipline.
Failure of an employee to perform his or her assigned duties so as to meet fully explicitly stated or implied standards of performance may constitute adequate grounds for discharge, reduction or suspension. Where appropriate, such grounds may include, but are not limited to, qualitative as well as quantitative elements of performance, such as failure to exercise sound judgment, failure to report information accurately and completely, failure to deal effectively with the public, and failure to make productive use of human, financial and other assigned resources. Grounds for discharge, reduction or suspension may also include any behavior or pattern of behavior which negatively affects an employee's productivity, or which is unbecoming a county employee; or any behavior or condition which impairs an employee's qualifications for his or her position or for continued county employment.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
18.04 - Insufficient facts.
A.
The commission may, on appeal, find in an appropriate case without a hearing that the specific facts alleged in the letter of discharge or reduction, if true, are not sufficient under all the circumstances to justify the discharge or reduction.
B.
If the commission concludes that the reasons are not sufficient to justify such discharge or reduction, it shall so notify the appointing power concerned. Such notification shall be a bar to any discharge or reduction for the specific reasons which have been presented, and the discharged or reduced employee shall be reinstated retroactively to his/her position as of a date set by the commission. If the commission finds that the employee was without fault or delinquency, the employee shall be reinstated as of the date of discharge or reduction.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
18.05 - Probationary period following first appointment.
An employee who has not yet completed a first probationary period may be discharged or reduced in accordance with Rule 18.07 by the appointing power by written notice, served on the employee and a copy filed with the director of personnel, specifying the grounds and the particular facts on which the discharge or reduction is based.
