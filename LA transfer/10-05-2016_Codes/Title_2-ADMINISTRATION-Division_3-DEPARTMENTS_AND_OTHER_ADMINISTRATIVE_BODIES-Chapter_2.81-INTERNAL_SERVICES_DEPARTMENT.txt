2.81.035 - Division of responsibilities for internal county services.
Internal county services are those services which support county departments in their delivery of services to the public. Internal services include, but are not limited to, facilities operations, maintenance and repair; design, operation and maintenance of communications and data processing facilities, systems and equipment; fleet management and maintenance; business machine maintenance; security services; purchasing, storage and distribution of personal property, equipment and supplies; printing services; energy management; and parking management. Internal county services are divided into three categories as designated by the chief administrative officer: centralized, decentralized and delegated. Responsibility for these services is as follows:
A.
Centralized Internal Services. The director is responsible for managing and providing centralized internal services to county departments, to the extent permitted by budgeted funds or paid for by recipients or requestors of the services.
B.
Decentralized Internal Services. Each county department head is responsible for arranging for the provision of decentralized internal services to support his or her department's operations in compliance with county-wide standards established by the chief administrative officer, approved by the board of supervisors, and monitored by the auditor-controller. Unless otherwise directed by the chief administrative officer, each county department head may purchase decentralized internal services from the department; or may purchase these services from outside contractors, provided the department's bid for such services has been solicited and considered, subject to provisions of law, the approval of the chief administrative officer, and compliance with contracting policies adopted by the board of supervisors; or may, with the approval of the chief administrative officer and the director, provide these services with in-house staff or purchase them from another county department. Any change of service provider from the department to another provider, including in-house staff, shall be done in conjunction with policies established by the chief administrative officer. In competing to be selected as the provider of decentralized internal services, the department shall function as an entrepreneurial organization with the mission of marketing, selling and delivering high-quality, competitively priced services to county departments and other customers and shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, operate with flexibility analogous to private sector providers of similar services. All services rendered shall be paid for by the recipient or requestor of the services.
C.
Delegated Internal Services. The director is responsible for providing these services but may delegate their day-to-day operation to requesting county department heads according to policies established by the chief administrative officer and procedures established by, and subject to the approval and supervision of, the director. Such delegation may be rescinded by the director upon approval of the chief administrative officer.

Guidelines for use of these other purchasing methods are as follows:
A.
Informal Bid. In general and where applicable, procedures concerning formal bids are equally applicable to informal bids. They should be used only when the product or service cannot be more efficiently obtained through formal bid, and where the product or service meets at least one of the following qualifications:
1.
Repair part, component or accessory for which no substitute is available;
2.
Value or volume does not warrant formal bid; or
3.
Time requirements are such as to make it impracticable to process by formal bid.
B.
Telephone Bid. The telephone bid may be used when immediate delivery is essential and at least three quotations shall be solicited.
C.
Prior Bid, Last Price. Award may be made on the basis of a prior bid or last price, if the conditions of purchase are similar, with the approval of the director.
D.
Monopoly. Award may be made without bidding when the item to be purchased can be obtained from only one source and the item is one which does not economically lend itself to substitution.
E.
Letter Quotations. This method shall be used in the same manner as the informal bid. The letter quotation is a written offer made to the county by a bidder usually, but not exclusively, modifying or extending a previous offer.
(Ord. 89-0026 § 1 (part), 1989.)
2.81.955 - Extension of bid closing date.
Extensions of bid closing date will only be granted with the approval of the director. Notification of extension of date will be made by amendment to the request for quotation, and such amendment will be mailed to all firms sent the original request. No informal extension shall be obtained by any vendor without this process.
(Ord. 89-0026 § 1 (part), 1989.)
2.81.960 - Acceptance of other than low bid and award upon negotiation—Reports required.

The director shall submit to the board of supervisors a monthly report of all contracts estimated to result in an expenditure of more than $5,000.00 which are awarded to other than the low bidder, are awarded without being put out to competitive bid, or are awarded, extended or amended upon the basis of negotiation or renegotiation, such report to include the reasons therefor. Awards made by individual department heads pursuant to decentralization delegation of purchasing authority by the director and subject to the above limitations shall be reported to the board of supervisors separately by the awarding department.
(Ord. 89-0026 § 1 (part), 1989.)
2.81.965 - Local preference.
All factors being equal and to the extent authorized by law, the county shall first prefer products grown, manufactured or produced in Los Angeles County, and then in the state of California.

2.81.990 - Limitation of chapter applicability.
This chapter shall not be deemed or construed as imposing any duty upon, or authorizing any act by, the director which duty or act is imposed upon or required to be done by any other county officer, department or employee pursuant to the provisions of any general law, or any provision of the Charter of the county of Los Angeles.
