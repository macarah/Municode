C.
The county and a certified employee organization may negotiate an agreement providing for final and binding arbitration of unresolved grievances, subject to such limitations on the scope of arbitrable grievances as the parties may deem appropriate or as may be required by law.

D.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to supersede the authority of the civil service commission.

(Ord. 2013-0035 § 14, 2013; Ord. 9646 § 11, 1968.)
5.04.240 - Unfair employee relations practices designated—Corrective action.
A.
It shall be an unfair employee relations practice for the county:
1.
To interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights recognized or granted in this chapter;
2.
To dominate or interfere with the formation of any employee organizations or contribute financial support to it, provided that the county may permit the use of county facilities, make dues deductions, and permit employees who are officers or representatives of employee organizations to confer with county officials during working hours without loss of time or pay, subject to applicable regulations;
3.
To refuse to negotiate with representatives of certified employee organizations on negotiable matters.
B.
It shall be an unfair employee relations practice for employee organizations or their representatives or members:
1.
To interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights recognized or granted in this chapter;
2.
To refuse to negotiate with county officials on negotiable matters, when the employee organization involved has been certified as the majority representative.
C.
With respect to the impasse procedures set forth in Section 5.04.250 of this chapter, it shall be an unfair employee relations practice for either the county or a certified employee organization to fail or refuse to cooperate with the commission or with any mediators or fact-finders designated by it.
D.
Charges of violations of this section or of this chapter, or of applicable rules or regulations may be initiated by a management representative, by a representative of any employee organization or by an individual employee or group of employees. Such charges shall be filed in writing with the commission. Each charge so filed shall be processed in accordance with the rules and regulations of the commission.
E.
If the commission decides that the county has engaged in an unfair employee relations practice or had otherwise violated this chapter or any rule or regulation issued thereunder, the commission shall direct the county to take appropriate corrective action.
1.
Such order shall be binding on the county, unless it requires action by the board of supervisors to make appropriations adjustments, transfers or revisions as provided by Section 29000 et seq. of the Government Code, or the adoption of a county ordinance by the board of supervisors. If the county fails to take action to comply with a binding order of the commission within such reasonable time as the commission may specify, an aggrieved party may petition the Superior Court for a writ of mandate to enforce the order.
2.
If the commission's decision and order requires action by the board of supervisors as set forth above, the chief executive officer shall submit the appropriate documents and materials to the board of supervisors to enable it to take such action. If the board of supervisors does not take action within such reasonable time as the commission may specify, the commission shall so notify the other parties. An aggrieved party may then seek judicial relief from the Superior Court for enforcement of the commission's order to the extent that compliance with such order is required by state law, or by this chapter or any valid rule or regulation issued thereunder. Notwithstanding the failure of the board of supervisors to take such action, the Superior Court shall have jurisdiction to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence in light of the whole record and in its discretion to take additional evidence and to issue a writ of mandamus enforcing the commission's order on a finding by the Superior Court that the county has committed an unfair employee relations practice in violation of state law, or this chapter.
F.
If the decision is that an employee organization or its representatives or members have engaged in an unfair employee relations practice, or have otherwise violated this chapter or any rule or regulation issued thereunder, the commission shall direct the offending party to take appropriate corrective action. If compliance with the commission's decision is not obtained within the time specified by the commission, it shall so notify the chief executive officer who may then take appropriate action, subject, however, to appeal to the commission by the affected party.
(Ord. 2013-0035 § 15, 2013; Ord. 85-0032 § 1(i), (j), 1985; Ord. 11155 § 1, 1975; Ord. 9646 § 12, 1968.)
5.04.250 - Impasse resolution procedures.
A.
If the appropriate management representatives and the representatives of a certified employee organization reach an impasse, the matter may be submitted to the commission by either party.
B.
The commission shall consider all requests for mediation, fact-finding or arbitration under this section. If the commission concludes that there has been insufficient effort between the parties to resolve the impasse, it may deny the request and remand the matter to the parties for further consideration. If the commission concludes that such further consideration would not result in settlement, it may in its discretion attempt to mediate the dispute, or it may appoint one or more mediators or fact-finders to assist the parties. The commission may institute mediation or fact-finding on its own motion, on initial/successor memorandum of understanding. The commission may invoke arbitration only by mutual consent of the parties. The processes for these arbitrations shall be established by agreement of the parties.
C.
The following constitute the jurisdictional and procedural requirements for the implementation of mediation, fact-finding or arbitration on initial/successor memorandum of understanding:
1.
Mediation, when requested by either party at interest or instituted by commission initiative, prior to fact-finding, is authorized in connection with all disputed matters. All mediation proceedings shall be private. The mediator or mediators shall prepare and file a confidential report with the commission.
2.
