CHAPTER 14 - EXTERIOR WALLS

SECTION 1403 - PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
1403.3   Structural.
Exterior walls, and the associated openings, shall be designed and constructed to resist safely the superimposed loads required by Chapter 16. In no case shall veneer be considered as part of the wall in computing strength of deflection nor shall it be considered a part of the required thickness of the wall. Deflection of lateral support of veneer, including wood studs, shall be no greater than h/500.
(Ord. 2010-0053 § 24, 2010; Ord. 2007-0108 § 4 (part), 2007.)
SECTION 1405 - INSTALLATION OF WALL COVERINGS
1405.6   Masonry or Stone veneer.
Support of masonry and stone veneer shall be designed by a registered design professional, unless the masonry or stone veneer complies with the following:
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 4 (part), 2007.)
1405.6.1.   Masonry and stone units [5 inches (127 mm) maximum in thickness].
Masonry and stone veneer not exceeding 5 inches (127 mm) in thickness may be anchored directly to structural masonry, concrete or studs in one of the following manners:
1.
Wall ties conforming to the following requirements. Wall ties shall be corrosion resistant, made of sheet metal, shall have a minimum thickness of .0785 inch (02.00 mm) (No. 14 galvanized sheet gage) by 1 inch (25.4 mm) and shall be attached to the backing, as the veneer is laid, by minimum #10 hex head galvanized screws with penetration of at least 2 inches (51 mm) into the framing member, placed not more than 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) above the extended leg of the angle tie. Wall ties shall be spaced so as to support not more than 2 square feet (0.19 m2) of wall area but shall not be more than 24 inches (610 mm) on center horizontally. For Seismic Design Categories D, E, & F, wall ties shall have a lip or hook on the extended leg that will engage or enclose a horizontal joint reinforcement wire having a diameter of 0.148 inch (3.76 mm) (No. 9 B.W. gage) or equivalent. The joint reinforcement shall be continuous with butt splices between ties permitted.
When applied over wood stud construction, the studs shall be spaced a maximum of 16 inches (406 mm) on center and approved paper, a minimum 30# fiberglass felt, 4 inch (102 mm) minimum on horizontal laps and 6 inch (152 mm) minimum on end laps, shall first be applied over minimum 15/32 inch (12 mm) plywood sheathing except as otherwise provided in Section 91.1402, and an air space of at least 1-inch (25 mm) shall be maintained between the backing and the veneer. Spot bedding at all ties shall be of cement mortar.
2.
Veneer conforming to the following requirements: Veneer applied with 1-inch-minimum (25 mm) grouted backing space which is reinforced by not less than 2-inch by 2-inch (51 mm by 51 mm) 0.065 inch (1.65 mm) (No. 16 B.W. gage) galvanized wire mesh placed over waterproof paper backing and anchored directly to stud construction. Such construction shall be allowed to a height not to exceed 4 feet (1219 mm) above grade.
The stud spacing shall not exceed 16 inches (406 mm) on center. The galvanized wire mesh shall be anchored to wood studs by galvanized steel wire furring nails at 4 inches (102 mm) on center or by barbed galvanized nails at 6 inches (152 mm) on center with a 11/8-inch-minimum (29 mm) penetration. The galvanized wire mesh may be attached to steel studs by equivalent wire ties. If this method is applied over solid sheathing the mesh must be furred for embedment in grout. The wire mesh must be attached at the top and bottom with not less than 8d (64 mm) common wire nails. The grout fill shall be placed to fill the space intimately around the mesh and veneer facing.
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 4 (part), 2007.)
1405.6.2.   Stone units [10 inches (254 mm) maximum in thickness].
Stone veneer units not exceeding 10 inches (254 mm) in thickness may be anchored directly to structural masonry or concrete. Anchor ties shall not be less than 0.109 inch (2.77 mm) (No. 12 B.W. gage) galvanized wire, or approved equal, formed as an exposed eye and extending not less than 1/2 inch (3 mm) beyond the face of the backing. The legs of the loops shall not be less than 6 inches (152 mm) in length bent at right angles and laid in the masonry mortar joint and spaced so that the eyes or loops are 12 inches (254 mm) maximum on center in both directions. There shall be provided not less than a 0.109 inch (2.77 mm) (No. 12 B.W. gage) galvanized wire tie, or approved equal, threaded through the exposed loops for every 2 square feet (0.19 m 2 ) of stone veneer. This tie shall be a loop having legs not less than 15 inches (381 mm) in length so bent that it will lie in the stone veneer mortar joint. The last 2 inches (51 mm) of each wire leg shall have a right angle bend. One inch (25 mm) of cement grout shall be placed between the backing and the stone veneer.
