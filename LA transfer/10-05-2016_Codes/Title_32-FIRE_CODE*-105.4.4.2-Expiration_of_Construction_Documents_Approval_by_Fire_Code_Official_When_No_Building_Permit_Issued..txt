105.4.4.2 - Expiration of Construction Documents Approval by Fire Code Official When No Building Permit Issued.
A fire code official construction document approval necessary for a building permit to be issued, for which the building official ultimately does not issue a building permit, shall expire one year after the date of approval by the fire code official. Construction documents including plans, specifications, and computations previously submitted may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the fire code official. The fire code official may extend the time for action by the applicant for a period of six months beyond the one-year limit upon written request by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented action from being taken. No construction or plan approval document shall be extended more than once.
Once a construction document approval and any extension thereof has expired, the applicant shall resubmit construction documents including plans, specifications, and computations. Construction document approval for which a building permit has been issued and thereafter expired according to the Building Code shall be null and void. In such circumstances, construction documents including plans, specifications, and computations shall be resubmitted for construction document approval.
