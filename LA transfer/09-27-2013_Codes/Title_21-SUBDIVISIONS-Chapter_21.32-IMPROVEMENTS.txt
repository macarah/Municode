The species of tree(s) planted pursuant to this section shall be subject to the review and approval of the Director of Regional Planning.
D.
Size. All required trees pursuant to this section shall be a minimum size of five gallons and shall have a minimum height of 10 feet at the time of planting.

F.
1.
Action to establish an area of benefit may be initiated by the Board of Supervisors upon its own motion or upon the recommendation of the Road Commissioner;
