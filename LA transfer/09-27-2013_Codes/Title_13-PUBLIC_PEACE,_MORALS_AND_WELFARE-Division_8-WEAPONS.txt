Chapter 13.67 - PROHIBITION ON THE SALE OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION ON COUNTY PROPERTY
Sections:

13.67.010 - Legislative findings.
A.
Gunshot fatalities and injuries are of epidemic proportions in Los Angeles County; and
B.
Government at all levels has a substantial interest in protecting the people from those who acquire guns illegally and use them to commit crimes resulting in injury or death of their victims; and
C.
Recent events throughout the county have generated additional fears of random usage of guns to commit violence on unsuspecting residents, children and adults alike; and
D.
In Los Angeles County, in 1997 there were 1,385 firearms deaths. Additionally, in 1997 there were 2,651 hospitalizations for nonfatal injuries. Of these, 2,322 were assault/homicides; 64 were self-inflicted wounds/suicides, and 205 resulted from unintentional shootings; and
E.
In Los Angeles County, 271 young people aged 19 or younger were killed with firearms in 1997 and an additional 839 were hospitalized for firearms-related injuries; and
F.
Homicides committed with handguns are the leading cause of firearms related injuries and death in California. In 1997 alone, there were 1,944 homicides committed with a firearm in California and approximately 25,000 firearms-related injuries. The vast majority of these deaths and injuries were attributable to handguns; and
G.
The widespread availability of illegally obtained firearms has resulted in a significant rise in the number of shooting incidents across the country; and
H.
According to a recent report prepared by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) entitled "Gun Shows: Brady Checks and the Crime Gun Traces, January 1999," gun shows provide a forum for illegal firearms sales and trafficking. The ATF reviewed 314 recent investigations that involved gun shows in some capacity. The report states as follows:
The ATF investigations paint a disturbing picture of gun shows as a venue for criminal activity and a source of firearms used in crimes. Felons, although prohibited from acquiring firearms, have been able to purchase firearms at gun shows. In fact, felons buying or selling firearms were involved in more than 46 percent of the investigations involving gun shows. In more than a third of the investigations, the firearms involved were known to have been used in subsequent crimes. These crimes included drug offenses, felons in possession of a firearm, assault, robbery, burglary, and homicide; and

The ATF report proceeds to state as follows:
Firearms involved in the 314 reviewed investigations numbered more than 54,000. A large number of these firearms were sold or purchased at gun shows. More than one-third of the investigations involved more than 50 firearms, and nearly one-tenth of the investigations involved more than 250 firearms. The two largest investigations were reported to have involved up to 7,000 and 10,000 firearms, respectively. These numbers include both new and used firearms; and

One of the ATF investigations took place in 1994 where the ATF recovered two 9mm firearms which were traced to a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) in Whittier, California. The FFL had sold over 1,700 firearms to unlicensed purchasers over a four-year period without maintaining any records. Many of the sales occurred at swap meets in California. The firearms were then sold to gang members in Santa Ana and Long Beach, California; and
K.
The ATF report also states that:
Although Brady Act background checks have been successful in preventing felons and other prohibited persons from buying firearms from FFLs, gun shows leave a major loophole in the regulation of firearms sales. Gun shows provide a large market where criminals can shop for firearms anonymously. Unlicensed sellers have no way of knowing whether they are selling to a violent felon or someone who intends to illegally traffic guns on the streets to juveniles or gangs. Further, unscrupulous gun dealers can use these free-flowing markets to hide their off-the-book sales. While most gun show sellers are honest and law-abiding, it only takes a few to transfer large numbers of firearms into dangerous hands; and

At the Great Western Gun Show held at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds last April 30th—May 2nd, the State Department of Justice (DOJ) conducted a sting operation to determine if illegal gun trafficking was occurring. During this event, DOJ agents purchased several items that are not legal for sale in California, including two illegal assault weapons, five illegal machine gun conversion kits, and one illegal rocket launcher with projectile. Each of these items was purchased without the completion of a background check as required by law. The firearms purchased were delivered immediately to the agents, without regard to the 10-day waiting period that is also required by law. According to the Attorney General, the only reason agents were not able to identify more illegal gun trafficking is because they ran out of time and money. In fact, city of Pomona police arrested five additional individuals at the gun show for illegal sales; and
M.
According to the ATF, on August 13, 1999, the ATF, Pomona Police Department and the State DOJ Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement (BNE) made an arrest after an individual delivered 10 Sten machine guns, and a Browning Automatic Rifle to an undercover ATF agent. Pursuant to a search of his residence, additional machine guns and machine gun kits were discovered. The selling of machine guns or the kits to manufacture machine guns is a violation of federal firearms law. The investigation began on July 10, 1999, after undercover agents met with the individual at his vendor's table at the Great Western Gun Show, Fairplex Complex in the city of Pomona. This meeting eventually led to the delivery of six machine guns in the days following the initial negotiations; and

At least three of the weapons acquired or possessed by the robbers in the infamous North Hollywood shoot-out of February 28, 1997, were traced back to a gun show on county property where the robbers had purchased them.
