The approved geotechnical report, and the construction documents prepared by the registered design professionals, shall be used to determine compliance.
(Ord. 2010-0053 § 35, 2010.)
SECTION 1705 - STATEMENT OF SPECIAL INSPECTIONS
1705.3 Seismic resistance.
. . .
Exception: Seismic requirements are permitted to be excluded from the statement of special inspections for structures designed and constructed in accordance with the following:
. . .
3.
Detached one- or two-family dwellings not exceeding two stories above grade plane, provided the structure is not assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E, or F and does not have any of the following plan or vertical irregularities in accordance with Section 12.3.2 of ASCE 7:
. . .
(Ord. 2010-0053 § 36, 2010.)
SECTION 1709 - STRUCTURAL OBSERVATIONS
1709.1 General.
Where required by the provisions of Section 1709.2 or 1709.3 the owner shall employ the registered design professional responsible for the structural design, or another registered design professional designated by the registered design professional responsible for the structural design to perform structural observations as defined in Section 1702.
The owner or owner's representative shall coordinate and call a preconstruction meeting between the registered design professional responsible for the structural design, structural observer, contractor, affected subcontractors and special inspectors. The structural observer shall preside over the meeting. The purpose of the meeting shall be to identify the major structural elements and connections that affect the vertical and lateral load resisting systems of the structure and to review scheduling of the required observations. A record of the meeting shall be included in the report submitted to the building official.
Observed deficiencies shall be reported in writing to the owner's representative, special inspector, contractor and the building official. The structural observer shall submit to the building official a written statement, in the form prescribed by the building official, at each significant construction stage stating that the required site visits have been made and identifying any reported deficiencies which, to the best of the structural observer's knowledge, have not been resolved. A final report by the structural observer which states that all observed deficiencies have been resolved is required before acceptance of the work by the building official.
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 7 (part), 2007.)
1709.2 Structural observations for seismic resistance.
Structural observations shall be provided for those structures included in Seismic Design Category D, E or F, as determined in Section 1613, where one or more of the following conditions exist:
3.
The structure is classified as Occupancy Category I or II in accordance with Section 1604.5 and a lateral design is required for the structure or portion thereof.
EXCEPTION: One-story wood framed Group R-3 and Group U Occupancies less than 2000 square feet, provided the adjacent grade is not steeper than 1 unit vertical in 10 units horizontal (10% sloped), assigned to Seismic Design Category D.
(Ord. 2007-0108 § 7 (part), 2007.)
1709.3 Structural observations for wind requirements.
SECTION 1710 - DESIGN STRENGTHS OF MATERIALS
1710.1 General.
Where required by the provisions of Section 1710.2 or 1710.3, the owner shall employ astructural observer to perform structural observations as defined in Section 1702. The structural observer shall be one of the following individuals:
1.
The registered design professional responsible for the structural design, or
2.
A registered design professional designated by the registered design professional responsible for the structural design.
. . .
The owner or owner's representative shall coordinate and call a preconstruction meeting between the structural observer, contractors, affected subcontractors, and special inspectors. The structural observer shall preside over the meeting. The purpose of the meeting shall be to identify the major structural elements and connections that affect the vertical and lateral load resisting systems of the structure and to review scheduling of the required observations. A record of the meeting shall be included in the report submitted to the Building Official.
Observed deficiencies shall be reported in writing to the owner or owner's representative, special inspector, contractor, and the Building Official. Upon the form prescribed by the Building Official, the structural observer shall submit to the Building Official a written statement at each significant construction stage stating that the site visits have been made and identifying any reported deficiencies which, to the best of the structural observer's knowledge, have not been resolved. A final report by the structural observer which states that all observed deficiencies have been resolved is required before acceptance of the work by the Building Official.
(Ord. 2010-0053 § 37, 2010.)
1710.2 Structural observations for seismic resistance.
. . .
3.
The structure is classified as Occupancy Category I or II in accordance with Table 1604.5, and a lateral design is required for the structure or portion thereof.
Exception: One-story wood framed Group R-3 and Group U Occupancies less than 2000 square feet in area, provided the adjacent grade is not steeper than 1 unit vertical in 10 units horizontal (10 percent sloped), assigned to Seismic Design Category D.
