(Ord. 95-0068 § 3 (part), 1995.)
101.2 Purpose and Intent
The purpose of this Code is to provide minimum standards to preserve the public health, safety and welfare by regulating the design, construction, quality of material, and installation of plumbing. Consistent with this purpose, the provisions of this Code are intended and always have been intended to confer a benefit on the community as a whole and are not intended to establish a duty of care toward any particular person.
This Code shall not be construed to hold the County or any officer, employee, or agent thereof responsible for any damage to persons or property by reason of any inspection authorized herein or by reason of the issuance or non-issuance of any permit authorized herein, and/or for any action or omission in connection with the application and/or enforcement of this Code. By adopting the provisions of this Code the County does not intend to impose on itself, its employees, or agents any mandatory duties of care towards persons and property within its jurisdiction so as to provide a basis of civil liability for damages.
This section is declaratory of existing law and is not to be construed as suggesting that such was not the purpose and intent of previous Code adoptions.

Any person applying for a permit shall, at the time the application is made, pay to the Chief Plumbing Inspector the fees set forth in this section.
Except as provided herein, a plumbing permit and a sewer or private sewage disposal permit shall be required for each building or installation. EXCEPTION: Where accessory buildings and/or appurtenances, such as laundry rooms, guest houses, bath houses or swimming pools, are used in conjunction with a single-family residence, are located on the same lot and under the same ownership, and are erected at the same time as the main building, all plumbing items may be combined on one plumbing permit. All buildings and appurtenances, regardless of type, located on the same lot and under the same ownership may, when being connected at the same time to a common house sewer or to a common or multiple private sewage disposal system, be combined on one sewerage permit.
Plumbing permit fees shall be as specified in Table No. I.
Sewer and private sewage disposal permit fees shall be as specified in Table No. II.
For the purpose of this section, a sanitary plumbing outlet on which or to which a plumbing fixture or appliance may be set or attached shall be construed to be a fixture. Built-in dishwashers shall be construed fixtures whether individually trapped or not. Fees for reconnection and retest of existing plumbing systems in relocated buildings shall be based on the number of plumbing fixtures, gas systems, water heaters, etc. involved.
When interceptor traps or house-trailer site traps are installed at the same time as a house sewer on any lot, no sewer permit shall be required for the connection of any such trap to an appropriate inlet fitting provided in the house sewer by the permittee constructing such sewer.
When a permit has been obtained to connect an existing building or existing work to the public sewer, or to connect to a new private disposal facility, backfilling of private sewage disposal facilities abandoned consequent to such connection is included in the house sewer permit.

APPENDIX 1 - Legislative History for Ordinance 2269.
Ordinance 2269, the Plumbing Code for Los Angeles County, was originally adopted on May 29, 1933. Ordinance 2269 was kept up to date by frequent amendments until the entire Plumbing Code was repealed and replaced by Ordinance 95-0068. Major amendments, each amending Ordinance 2269 in its entirety or adopting the current edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code, are listed and briefly described in Table A below; amending ordinances are also listed.
Table B covers the legislative history of the county's own Plumbing Code provisions before Ordinance 95-0068 was passed, and gives the specific legislative history for each section. Some repealed material is included for continuity.
Table C shows the correspondence between sections of the 1991 Uniform Plumbing Code and the 1994 Uniform Plumbing Code. The 1991 Uniform Plumbing Code was extensively revised and renumbered to create the 1994 Uniform Plumbing Code.
Provisions of Ordinance 95-0068 and its amendments now comprise Title 28 of the Los Angeles County Code.
