2.
That a need for the proposed zone classification exists within such area or district; and

That the particular property under consideration is a proper location for said zone classification within such area or district; and

That placement of the proposed zone at such location will be in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare, and in conformity with good zoning practice; and
5.
That the proposed zone change is consistent with the adopted general plan for the area.
B.
The commission shall recommend approval or denial where the information submitted by the applicant and/or presented at public hearings substantiates or fails to substantiate such findings to the satisfaction of the commission.
(Ord. 85-0009 § 3, 1985; Ord. 1494 Ch. 3 Art. 2 § 309.1, 1927.)
22.16.160 - Proposed zone change—Water supply standards.
In addition to the principles and standards enumerated in Section 22.16.150, the commission, in determining its recommendation for a change of zone, shall consider whether or not the change of zone under consideration, if adopted, will result in a need for a greater water supply for adequate fire protection and, if so, what are the existing and proposed sources of such an adequate water supply. The commission may request that the forester and fire warden or county engineer, or both, supply it with all facts, opinions, suggestions and advice which may be material to reaching a decision on any or all matters mentioned in this section.
(Ord. 1494 Ch. 3 Art. 2 § 309.3, 1927.)
22.16.170 - Amendments—Conditions for approval.
In making its recommendation relative to a proposed amendment other than a zone change, the commission may recommend approval where the information presented at public hearing shows that such amendment is consistent with the general plan and is necessary to implement the general plan and/or that the public convenience, the general welfare or good zoning practice justifies such action.
(Ord. 85-0009 § 4, 1985: Ord. 1494 Ch. 3 Art. 2 § 309.5, 1927.)
22.16.180 - Commission recommendation—Resolution requirements.
A recommendation by the commission relative to a zone change or amendment shall lie by resolution carried by the affirmative vote of not less than three of its members. Such recommendation is final and conclusive and may not be reconsidered by the commission except upon a referral by the board of supervisors.
(Ord. 1494 Ch. 3 Art. 2 § 309.7, 1927.)
22.16.190 - Notice of commission action.
The commission shall serve a notice of its action in the manner prescribed by Section 22.60.190
(Ord. 1494 Ch. 3 Art. 2 § 309.9, 1927.)
22.16.200 - Public hearing by board—Procedures generally—Commission actions final when.
After receipt of the commission's recommendation, the board of supervisors shall hold a public hearing and shall give notice of such public hearing pursuant to the procedure set forth in Part 4 of Chapter 22.60; provided, however, that if the planning commission has recommended against the approval of an amendment other than a zone change, the board of supervisors shall not be required to take further action. In case of a change of zone where the commission has recommended denial, the action of the commission shall become final unless an interested party requests a hearing by the board of supervisors by filing a written request with the executive officer-clerk of the board within five days after the commission files its recommendations with the board of supervisors.
(Ord. 1494 Ch. 3 Art. 2 § 310, 1927.)
22.16.210 - Board approval, modification or disapproval of commission recommendations.
The board of supervisors may approve, modify or disapprove the recommendation of the commission involving a zone change or amendment, provided that any modification of the proposed zone change or amendment by the board of supervisors not previously considered by the commission during its hearing, shall first be referred to the commission for report and recommendation, but the commission shall not be required to hold a public hearing thereon. Failure of the commission to report within 40 days after the reference, or such longer period as may be designated by the board of supervisors shall be deemed to be approval of the proposed modification.
(Ord. 85-0009 § 5, 1985.)
22.16.220 - Public hearing by board—Notice of action taken.
The board of supervisors shall serve a notice of its action in the manner prescribed by Section 22.60.190
