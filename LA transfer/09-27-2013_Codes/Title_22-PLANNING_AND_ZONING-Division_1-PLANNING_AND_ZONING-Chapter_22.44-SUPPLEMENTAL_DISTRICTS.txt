22.44.113 - Agua Dulce Community Standards District.
A.
Intent and Purpose. The Agua Dulce Community Standards District is established to protect the secluded rural character of the community, to enhance the community's unique appeal, and to avoid the premature need for costly linear service systems such as sewers and water systems within the community. There have been a number of studies of Agua Dulce and its existing service systems. These studies have shown that, in 1983, 71 percent of the existing parcels were two acres in size or larger, and that increased densities might require expensive public sewage and water systems. The Santa Clarita Valley Areawide General Plan contains policy which clearly define standards for the future development of Agua Dulce.

22.44.126 - Acton Community Standards District.
A.
Intent and Purpose. The Acton Community Standards District is established to protect and enhance the rural, equestrian and agricultural character of the community and its sensitive features including significant ecological areas, floodplains, hillsides, National Forest, archaeological resources, multipurpose trail system, and Western heritage architectural theme. The standards are intended to ensure reasonable access to public riding and hiking trails, and to minimize the need for installation of infrastructure such as sewers, streetlights, concrete sidewalks and concrete flood control systems that would alter the community's character, while providing for adequate drainage and other community safety features.
B.
Description of District Boundary. The boundaries of the district are shown on the map following this section.
C.
Community-Wide Development Standards. Except where a more specific application is prescribed, or prior to the approval of a new structure or addition to an existing structure where the cumulative area of all additions made after the adoption of this section adds at least 400 square feet to the footprint of either primary or accessory structures, a site plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Planning Director to assure compliance with the following development standards:
1.
Hillside Design Considerations. Hillside resources are among the most important features of the Acton community. Hillside regulations shall be enforced by a specific written analysis in each case, demonstrating conformance with the following objectives. Development plans shall comply with the following objectives:
a.
Preserve to the greatest extent possible existing natural contours and natural rock outcropping features. Structures and required provisions for access and public safety should be designed to minimize encroachment on such features by the use of such techniques as curvilinear street designs and landform grading designs which blend any manufactured slopes or required drainage benches into the natural topography;
b.
Preserve to the greatest extent possible the natural silhouette in significant ridgeline areas. Significant ridgelines are the ridgelines that surround or visually dominate the Acton landscape either through their size in relation to the hillside or mountain terrain of which they are a part, or through their visual dominance as characterized by a silhouetting appearance against the sky, or through their visual dominance due to proximity and view from existing development, freeways and highways designated as Major, Secondary or Limited Secondary on the Highway Plan;
c.
While observing minimum lot area standards contained in this section, cluster development where such technique can be demonstrated to substantially reduce grading alterations and contribute to the preservation of native vegetation and prominent landmark features;
d.
Blend buildings and structures into the terrain by sensitive use of building setbacks, structure heights and architectural designs; and
e.
Minimize disruption of view corridors, scenic vistas and adjacent property by the use of sensitive site design and grading techniques.
2.
Preservation of Native Vegetation. Development plans shall emphasize the protection of, and revegetation with, native vegetation, including the native plants, grasses, shrubs and trees which intercept, hold and more slowly release rainfall than bare earth surfaces. It is intended that equestrian uses such as stables and arenas which will result in vegetation removal be accommodated, provided the design of these uses does not create erosion or flooding potential that would create a safety hazard to structures or off-site property, as determined by the department of public works. On any parcel consisting of one acre or greater, the removal or destruction of native vegetation exceeding 10 percent of the parcel area within any 12-month period shall require the director's approval.
a.
Required Site Plan. All permit applications involving grading (including brushing or vegetation removal to accommodate equestrian uses) must include a site plan for director's review. This information may be submitted in conjunction with other site plan information that may be required for the project. Within hillside areas, such site plan must comply with Section 22.56.215, which requires a conditional use permit for projects in hillside management areas. This information shall not substitute for oak tree permit requirements. Material submitted shall include:
i.
A description of the property, accompanied by a map showing the topography of the land and the location of any drainage courses; the location and extent of the proposed work and details of the precautionary measures or devices to be used to prevent erosion and flood hazards, including, if necessary, a drainage plan by a civil engineer showing routing of runoff, estimate of quantity and frequency of runoff, character of soils and channel sections and gradients;
ii.
A landscaping plan supportive of this subsection showing existing and proposed landscaping, acceptable to the department of regional planning. Such plan shall specifically identify California junipers, manzanita, Great Basin sage and Joshua trees and generally describe the type and condition of native vegetation. Soil types shall be specified in order to assess the feasibility of revegetation. Relandscaping of disturbed areas should emphasize the use of existing native, drought tolerant vegetation;
iii.
A long-term maintenance program for all landscaping in the proposed plan, both undisturbed and revegetated; the program shall focus on revegetated areas and shall cover a two-year period; funding provisions for the maintenance program shall be specified; and
iv.
Such other vegetation information as the director may deem necessary to fulfill the purpose of protecting property and public safety and preserving the character of the Acton community.
b.
Issuance Conditions. The director shall approve the site plan with appropriate conditions, relating to this subsection only, for all or a portion of the proposed work when satisfied:
i.
That the performance of such work is consistent with the intent of this subsection to preserve native vegetation;
ii.
That such work will not result in a flood or erosion hazard to this or other properties; and
iii.
That the proposed work conforms with the requirements of other laws or ordinances.
c.
For commercial agricultural uses, relief from the standards of this subsection pertaining to replacement with native vegetation may normally be granted through the provisions of subsection (C)(13) of this section.
d.
Exceptions. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to, and a grading permit is not required for:
i.
The removal or reduction of vegetation for the purpose of complying with county regulations relating to brush clearance for fire safety. This exception includes not only required vegetation control around structures but also the creation and maintenance by a public agency of firebreaks used to control the spread of fire;
ii.
The removal or destruction of vegetation on publicly owned rights-of-way for roads, highways, flood control projects or other similar or related uses;
iii.
The removal or destruction of vegetation by public utilities on rights-of-way or property owned by such utility, or on land providing access to such rights-of-way or property;
iv.
Work performed under a permit issued for precautionary measures to control erosion and flood hazards; and
v.
The selective removal or destruction of noxious weeds or plants which pose a hazard to animals.
3.
Architectural Style and Project Design Considerations.
a.
All uses in commercial land classifications in the Antelope Valley Area Plan and all nonresidential uses within urban residential or nonurban land classifications which are not accessory to residential structures shall:
i.
Not exceed a height of 35 feet except for chimneys and pole antennas, which may not exceed a height of 45 feet;
ii.
Be designed in a "Western frontier village, circa 1890s style" in substantial conformance with the architectural style guidelines accompanying this community standards district as an appendix and as maintained in the office of the planning director; and
iii.
Be designed to conceal from public view all external utilities, such as roof-mounted air conditioning or heating units, or other improvements not contributing to the Western architectural design, such as satellite dish antennas. Solar panels that are designed as part of a roof line and blend with the overall roof appearance need not be concealed. An exterior architectural rendering, with materials and colors indicated, shall be submitted with any request for director's review for structural improvements.
b.
Restricted access subdivisions are prohibited.
4.
Drainage. The following provisions are intended to slow or reduce runoff from new development and protect and enhance the rural character of Acton. In addition to existing county standards for the control of runoff, the following standards shall be observed:
a.
The maximum impervious finished surface area for residential and associated accessory uses shall not exceed 10 percent for lots three net acres or larger; not exceed 21 percent or 13,000 square feet, whichever is smaller, for lots between one and one-quarter net acres and three net acres; and not exceed 42 percent or 11,000 square feet, whichever is smaller, for lots smaller than one and one-quarter net acres;
b.
Maximum impervious finished surface areas for nonresidential uses shall not exceed:
i.
65 percent for open storage and homes for the aged;
ii.
74 percent for hospitals, cemeteries, mausoleums and mortuaries;
iii.
82 percent for churches and schools; or
iv.
90 percent for stores, office buildings, warehousing, manufacturing, storage, shopping centers, restaurants, service stations, parking lots, motels/hotels, kennels, lumber yards, professional buildings, banks and supermarkets;
c.
Partially impervious surfaces, such as perforated concrete blocks that allow vegetation growth, may be used where public safety is not a consideration, such as private patios and driveways; credit shall be given for the portion of such surfaces that are not impervious. This provision shall not be used to modify standards for parking surfaces required by Section 22.52.1060
d.
All residential buildings with rain gutters shall collect and direct all roof runoff towards permeable surfaces, rather than towards impervious surfaces such as paved driveways;
e.
The Acton Community Standards District discourages the use of concrete facilities to mitigate flood hazards; and
f.
Flood hazard mitigation shall be consistent with floodplain management practices and existing drainage policies.
5.
Billboards. The Acton Community Standards District shall be designated a billboard exclusion zone in compliance with Part 3 of Chapter 22.40
6.
Signs.
a.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, all signs permitted by this subsection shall conform to the following:
i.
Signage shall be unobtrusive and shall promote the style of the Western frontier architectural guidelines; and
ii.
Lighting shall be external, using fixtures designed to focus all light directly on the sign, and internal illumination shall be prohibited.

iv.
Temporary, directional, informational and special purpose signs, as provided for by Sections 22.52.940, 22.52.950, 22.52.960, 22.52.970, and 22.52.980
7.
Fence Design. In addition to standards provided in Section 22.48.160 concerning the height of fences, the following fence design features shall apply to the construction of perimeter fencing:
a.
Only split rail, open wood, wire or wrought iron style or similar open-type perimeter fences shall be permitted, except on residential lots of less than 10,000 square feet, or unless view-obscuring fences are required for visual shielding by other provisions of this title; and
b.
Except where otherwise required by ordinance, at least 70 percent of the entire fence area shall be non-view-obscuring; no slats or other view-obscuring materials may be inserted into or affixed to such fences. Any solid lineal sections must be primarily for structural purposes or provide minor architectural design features.
8.

Curbs and gutters, or fencing with inverted shoulders, may be required where trail use is within the roadway easement.
10.
Trail Easements. In reviewing and establishing design conditions for any land division, the hearing officer shall consider community trails objectives and whether or not they may be promoted or benefited by such division. Alternative proposals for trail easements consistent with community goals shall be developed and considered in conjunction with each land division.
a.
Unobstructed multipurpose pathways for both pedestrian and equestrian uses should be developed in each new land division to the satisfaction of both the department of public works and the department of parks and recreation. Although alignments that are not adjacent to roadways will generally be preferred, road easements may be used when the hearing officer determines that other locations are inappropriate.
b.
Any trail incorporated into a land division must contain a provision for participation in a community-wide trail maintenance financing district or other appropriate financing mechanism; the district or other financing mechanism must be established prior to the construction of the trail.
c.
The department of parks and recreation will work with the community to establish an appropriate mechanism for financing trail maintenance.
11.
Home Occupations. Home occupation uses are to be permitted, subject to a director's review, to enable a resident to carry on an income-producing activity, which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of residential property, when such activity will not be disruptive to the character of the Acton community.
a.
In addition to the principles and standards contained in Section 22.56.1690, the director shall ensure that an application for a home occupation use complies with the following standards and conditions:

APPENDIX FOR SECTION 22.44.126
ACTON COMMUNITY STANDARDS DISTRICT ARCHITECTURAL STYLE GUIDELINES
I.
Background
Acton is a rural community that began to develop in the 1800's as a center of gold and copper mining activity. By 1872, with the coming of the railroad and the development of large scale mining operations, Acton was a thriving community. In 1886 the Southern Pacific depot was established, bearing the name of Acton. For a short period of time, Acton with all its mines was an important town in the State of California. Several structures from this era remain. The 1878 school house now serves as a community church, and the 49er Saloon—remodeled and expanded, but retaining its "Western" look—remains a community fixture. Bricks from the 1890 Acton Hotel have been incorporated into a community monument.
As the mining activity decreased at the turn of the century, the area changed to predominantly ranching activities. It is in keeping with this rich frontier mining town heritage that these Architectural Style Guidelines for commercial areas have been established.
II.
Objectives
Section C.3 of the Community Standards District provides for the application of Architectural Style Guidelines in Acton, primarily in commercial areas, as defined by the Land Use Policy Map for the Antelope Valley Area Plan. There are two distinct commercial areas: 1) "Old Town" south of the Freeway along Crown Valley Road and 2) the newly developing uses adjacent to the Freeway, particularly to the north. The objectives of the guidelines include:
— Identification and description of the qualities which give a "Western frontier village, circa 1890's style" character to much of the existing commercial area—particularly the older development in the vicinity of Crown Valley Road and Soledad Canyon Road.
— Assistance in guiding and promoting architectural rehabilitation throughout Acton that is consistent with its Western heritage.
— Development of new commercial structures that promote and enhance the community's Western Heritage architectural character.
III.
Guidelines
The entire Community Standards District is intended to help preserve a Western desert community character. Vegetation, street improvements, trails, lighting, fencing, signage, building heights, setbacks and other features of the CSD all complement the Western appearance. The Architectural Style Guidelines are intended to put the finishing touches on the exterior appearance of the commercial community. The following guidelines provisions are to be used in designing all exterior improvements:
A.
Facades
B.
Roof forms
C.
Sidewalk coverings
D.
Signs
E.
Colors
F.
Materials
G.
Landscaping
H.
Exterior features: lights, railings, street furniture, etc.
A.
FACADES
Building exteriors, particularly storefronts, are the most visible elements of a commercial community. The surfaces, materials and colors that complement the overall architectural design create a visual statement as well as provide a framework for signage, landscaping and street furnishings that can complete a desired appearance.
Lineal Design:
"Western" town commercial structures have strong horizontal lines; parapets, signs, railings, balconies, sidewalk coverings, transom windows and kickplates are typical lineal features. Projecting or recessed horizontal architectural or decorative features help create dimension and interest on a plain facade. While diversity—e.g. Victorian design—among individual stores is encouraged, horizontal lines can help create a cohesive community and encourage one's eyes to scan the entire area.
Encourage
* A predominating horizontal line along the top of the building facade.
* Alignment of tops of windows and door openings.
* The clear division of two story structures between the first and second floors.
* Second floor balconies and railings; their strong horizontal structure adds depth and visual interest
* Horizontal lines that carry from one store or structure to the next.
Discourage
* Horizontal elements that do not involve structural features; a painted horizontal stripe, for example, should not be used where wood trim would create dimension and texture.
Entries:
Stores along a "Western" street typically have recessed entries. This feature draws a shopper toward the sheltered door area, which is generally flanked with display windows. This architectural characteristic is in contrast to modern commercial designs which generally align all storefronts and entrances along a straight walkway.
Encourage
* Recessed storefront entries. Side and rear entries may be in line with exterior walls.
* Wood-appearing frame doors with glass panes—particularly in the upper half of the door—and suitable hardware (typically brass hinges and handles or push plates). Wood-frame screen doors can be used.
* Double entry doors, while not necessary, are particularly inviting.
Discourage
* Use of bright aluminum, tinted glass and other modern doorway materials.
* Frameless glass doors.
* Security doors and grates.
Windows:
Windows link the outside pedestrian with the inside business. They provide a showcase for the merchant and can do much to invite sidewalk shoppers to enter an establishment. Western Village-type windows would authentically be multi-pane, with wood frames. While this look is preferred, larger single-pane showcase windows may provide a better display format; as long as the window frame has an appearance that blends with the overall facade, window pane size will not be a judged factor.
Encourage
* Window designs that harmonize with those in adjacent structures.
* Kickplates that line the lower part of the storefront below the glass. Transom windows are a typical feature over the display windows.
* Use of clear glass or lightly tinted glass only; glass may contain suitable decorative etching.
* Use of shutters, louvers or interior blinds where privacy or restricted views are needed.
Discourage
* Design or alteration of window openings that are inconsistent with the architectural character of the building.
* Use of darkly tinted or reflective glass.
* Full length plate glass windows.
* Finished appearance that does not reflect intended architectural design. Aluminum used for window and door frames, for example, is a modern-appearing material that is inappropriate.
Side and Rear Facade Features:
Structures in the commercial areas of Acton are often visible on all sides. Some establishments may permit access from other than the front entry. It is important that these facades be attractively maintained in character with the Western architecture theme. Utilities, trash bins and other such features of rear and side areas should be covered or disguised in the same architectural theme wherever possible.
B.
ROOF FORMS
Unlike residences of the by-gone Western era with their pitched roofs, commercial buildings are known for their predominantly flat-roofed appearance. Where pitched roofs exist, they are generally hidden from street view by either a parapet—an upward extension of part of the front wall—or a false front (with the exception of Victorian-style structures). While top roof lines can carry a horizontal theme around the commercial area, individuality should be encouraged; multi-height parapets and false fronts add variety. Special roof lines, raised heights or other distinctive treatments are appropriate over major building entry points or corner structures.
Encourage
* Predominantly flat roofs.
* Sloping roofs hidden from front view by parapets or false fronts with horizontal lines.
* "Accent" roof lines or other architectural features—higher than the surrounding roof lines—at corners and major entrances.
* Screening of roof mounted equipment (see Acton Community Standards District, Section C.3).
Discourage
* Sloped or pitched roofs—particularly those visible from street view, unless of Victorian design.
* Decorative roof elements that do not focus on corner or entry areas.
C.
SIDEWALK COVERINGS
Motion picture-created images of Western towns often portray hot, dusty main streets; a respite from the sun was found in the shade provided by coverings along the boardwalks. In Acton today, paved streets minimize the dust, and air conditioning provides ideal climate control. Sidewalk coverings, however, are still functional: in addition to reinforcing the Western architectural style, they provide an invitation to window shoppers, protect window displays and shield windows from the heat of the day, thereby conserving energy.
Sidewalk coverings are typically constructed of rough wood, supported by wooden posts. They may serve as second story balconies. Awnings can also be used, but should be of plain canvas-type material; rounded or scalloped edges, stripes or patterns are not appropriate. Where posts are used, wooden railings would complete the boardwalk area.
D.
SIGNS
Signage controls can "make or break" the visual image of a commercial community. This feature of the Acton community is so important that Section C.6 of the Acton Community Standards District contains specific regulations designed to prevent the use of modern signs.
The primary function of signs in Acton is to effectively identify business locations. Signs should not be used for advertising, unless based on verifiable authentic Western designs. Even then they must either conform to Section C.6 or undergo appropriate variance approvals. The following signage features supplement the requirements of Section C.6:
Encourage
* Flush-mounted signs, often within a recessed area on a parapet.
* Hanging signboards, either parallel or perpendicular to the building facade.
* Signs related in size, character and placement to other building elements.
* Graphics and lettering styles that are appropriate to the western motif. Signs for most franchises and chain stores will require redesign.
* Icon signs that illustrate the type of merchandise or service.
Discourage
* Signs that obscure all or part of a significant architectural feature.
* Garish colors that may attract attention, but which detract from a harmonious community appearance.
E.
COLORS
If there is a single "Western town" color, it would be earthtone. This color—or range of colors from beige to gray—is natural appearing in many of the materials used in constructing the old West. Brick, made from adobe clay, was often used in early Acton and is also an appropriate color. Brighter primary paint colors were available and were often used for signs and on metal surfaces to prevent rust. "Pastels" and "neons" are inappropriate colors in the Western palette.
Encourage
* Natural wood-look and brick tones as the predominant materials/colors of the commercial area. (Simulated woodappearing products may be used in place of real wood.)
* Colors that are coordinated with neighboring building colors and materials.
* Subtle colors on plain surfaces of large structures.
Discourage
* Changing colors along the main surface of a single building facade. A single color—generally natural wood—creates unity; individual stores can be differentiated by accent colors, parapets, signage and other distinguishing features.
F.
MATERIALS
Finished appearance is more important than the use of "genuine, authentic" materials. Available materials of the day (late 1800's) consisted primarily of wood, adobe, brick and stone. Modern materials are available that simulate these textures, and are generally acceptable in new or rehabilitation construction. Even concrete blocks can be used if faced with adobe-resembling stucco, for example, or covered entirely with vegetation. "Assembly" of these materials should reflect the building techniques and tools employed in the early West.
The chosen materials should be consistent with the structure; sidewalks, for example, would originally have been either boardwalk or stonewalk. Today, those materials would be welcome, although modern materials such as concrete may be used to replicate such appearances through special colorings and installation techniques.
Encourage
* Use of materials available in the old West, such as pine lumber, river rock and adobe.
* The adaptation of modern materials such as plastic, concrete and aluminum to resemble old West materials.
Discourage
* Modern materials that retain a contemporary appearance; painted metal "pipe" railings should be avoided in favor of wooden hand rails, for example.
G.
LANDSCAPING
Vegetation can provide an attractive, inviting and unifying element to a commercial district. Trees provide welcome shade in a desert community such as Acton. Trees and shrubbery can cover vacant areas or unattractive features such as utility installations and rubbish disposal areas, and can soften the hard appearance of parking lots. Planter boxes along storefronts can be a very decorative feature.
Section C.2 of the Acton Community Standards District emphasizes the preservation and use of high desert native vegetation. A commercial landscape palette must conform to these requirements, which will ensure compatibility of the vegetation with the architectural theme.
H.
EXTERIOR FEATURES
"Finishing touches" to the Western village architectural theme must consider all the exterior features, both functional and decorative. Lights and lamp posts, railings, trash receptacles, benches, and hitching posts would all be common to Acton commercial areas and in plain view. Sections C.8 and C.9 of the Acton Community Standards District establish general requirements for outdoor lighting. Modern lighting techniques which do not interfere with the Western motif may be used.
Utilities should be hidden from view wherever possible. Air conditioning units, for example, should ideally be roof-mounted. Room air conditioning units should never be installed in the front facade; the rear wall is generally preferable, with side walls acceptable.
Encourage
* Western style accessories such as sidewalk railings and hitching posts (which should be located to protect horses from motor vehicles). Cast iron-type benches and wood or woodenlooking trash "barrels" are appropriate and functional. Wagon wheels are a popular decorative item.
* Gas or gas-look lamps, where high visibility for safety is not a factor.
* The use of wood, wrought iron, ceramic or other materials from the old West era.
Discourage
* Modern decorative materials such as neon and plastics.

22.44.127 - Altadena Community Standards District.
A.
Intent and Purpose. The Altadena Community Standards District ("CSD") is established to ensure that new and expanded structures are compatible in size and scale with the characteristics of surrounding residential neighborhoods, protecting the light, air, and privacy of existing single-family residences from negative impacts. The CSD is also established to minimize the visual and environmental impacts of development in hillside management areas.
B.
Description of District. The boundaries of the District are coterminous with the boundaries of the Altadena Community Plan. The map of the District follows this Section.
C.
Community-wide Development Standards.
1.
Landscaping. Where landscaping is required by this CSD, it shall be maintained through regular pruning, weeding, fertilizing, litter removal, and replacement of plants as necessary.
2.
Hillside Management.

ii.
Changes to applications approved by the Department of Regional Planning prior to the effective date of the ordinance creating this subsection, provided that such changes:
(A)
Do not cumulatively increase the previously approved floor area or height of any structure by more than 10 percent; and
(B)
Do not cumulatively increase the previously approved amount of grading to more than 2,500 total cubic yards of material.
iii.
Applications to repair or reconstruct a damaged or destroyed structure that was legally established prior to the effective date of the ordinance creating this subsection.
b.
Permit Required.
i.
A minor conditional use permit, as provided in Section 22.56.085 shall be required for any development that is not otherwise subject to a conditional use permit pursuant to Section 22.56.215, except for:
(A)
Additions to a structure that was legally established prior to the effective date of the ordinance creating this subsection;
(B)
New accessory structures; and
(C)
Development designed so that all areas with a natural slope of 25 percent or greater remain in a natural state.
ii.
Applications for a minor conditional use permit shall include the information required by Section 22.56.215.D and shall substantiate the burden of proof required by Sections 22.56.090, 22.56.215.F.1.a, and 22.56.215.F.1.b.
c.
Grading.
i.
A conditional use permit, as provided in Part 1 of Chapter 22.56, shall be required for any grading on a lot or parcel of land that cumulatively exceeds 2,500 total cubic yards of material, excluding any grading approved prior to the effective date of the ordinance creating this subsection.
ii.
In approving a conditional use permit for grading, the Hearing Officer or Regional Planning Commission shall make the following findings in addition to those required by Section 22.56.090
(A)
The grading is designed to minimize disturbance to the natural hillside by clustering building pads and structures near existing paved streets, on areas with the flattest terrain, or on areas with the least visual impact; and
(B)
The overall development minimizes visual and environmental impacts to the surrounding area. In making this finding, the Hearing Officer or Regional Planning Commission shall require projects to comply with the following development standards regarding hillside design, where they apply to the project:
EXPAND
Grading and Topography • Grading is not conducted uniformly across the entirety of the project and is limited to the pads required of individual structures.
• Terracing and retention walls, if unshielded by landscaping and visible from downslope, are designed with varied gradients and curvilinear shapes that mimic or blend into surrounding contours.
Views and Screening • Structures, retention walls, and graded areas are screened by landscaping and vegetation.
• Structures are placed to minimize their visibility from surrounding parcels or public viewpoints downslope.
Surfaces and Reflectance • Structures incorporate articulated surface faces instead of flat blank walls.
• Structures incorporate colors, materials, and textures with an average Light Reflectance Value of 35 percent or less.
Landscaping • Where new tree planting occurs, new trees blend with surrounding vegetation.
Trails • Existing trail right-of-ways or trail heads within the project, dedicated to the County as of the effective date of the ordinance creating this subsection, are improved if necessary to ensure their ongoing use.
  In addition to these required design standards, the Hearing Officer or Regional Planning Commission may require that the applicant incorporate additional design standards which would further the intent and purpose of this CSD in minimizing the visual and environmental impacts of development in hillside management areas. Such standards may include, but are not limited to, requiring that visible topsoils used as grading fill match the color and texture of rocks and soils naturally occurring on site, requiring that project structures use matte or rough surfacing to diminish reflectances, requiring that stands of native vegetation are preserved or expanded, and requiring that mature trees are preserved.
iii.
Any application for grading involving the off-site transport of 1,000 or more cubic yards of material, shall include a haul route for review and approval by the Department of Regional Planning.
iv.
Any grading occurring during the rainy season, defined as October 15 of any year through April 15 of the subsequent year, shall be subject to mitigation measures deemed necessary by the Department of Public Works to prevent runoff and erosion.
d.
Significant Ridgeline Protection. Ridgelines are defined as the line formed by the meeting of the tops of sloping surfaces of land. Significant ridgelines are highly visible ridgelines that dominate the landscape. The locations of the significant ridgelines within the CSD are shown on the map following this Section.
i.
The highest point of any structure shall be located at least 50 vertical feet and 50 horizontal feet from a significant ridgeline, excluding chimneys, rooftop antennas, amateur radio antennas, roof-mounted solar panels, and wind energy conversion systems.
ii.
Any modification to the standards set forth in subsection 2.d.i. shall require a conditional use permit, pursuant to Part 1 of Chapter 22.56. In approving such conditional use permit, the Hearing Officer or Regional Planning Commission shall make the following findings in addition to those required by Section 22.56.090
(A)
Alternative sites within the project site have been considered and rejected due to the presence of documented hazards or the potential for greater damage to biota, as determined by a biologist; and
(B)
The overall development is designed to comply with the development standards provided in subsection C.2.c.ii.b.

ALTADENA COMMUNITY STANDARDS DISTRICT
CRITERIA FOR SIGNIFICANT RIDGELINES
The designation of the significant ridgelines within the Altadena Community Standards District is based on the following criteria:
•  Topographic complexity. Ridges that have a significant difference in elevation from the valley or canyon floor. Generally, these ridges are observable from any location on the valley floor, from a community, or from a public road. Geologic conditions in Altadena make this a common condition.
•  Near/far contrast. Ridges that are a part of a scene that includes a prominent landform in the foreground and a major backdrop ridge with an unbroken skyline. This includes a view into a valley rim or a pass. Often, layers of ridges are visible into the distance, such as on or adjacent to Chaney Trail. This contrast can be experienced viewing an entire panorama or a portion of a panorama from an elevated point.

a.
Definition. As used in this subsection D8, "recreational vehicle" means a camper, camp trailer, travel trailer, house car, motor home, trailer bus, trailer coach, or similar vehicle, with or without motive power, designed for human habitation for recreational or emergency occupancy. A recreational vehicle includes a boat, other watercraft, snowmobile, off-road vehicle that cannot legally be driven on public streets, and other similar types of vehicles. A trailer, whether open or enclosed, used to carry or tow property such as animals, boats or other watercraft, snowmobiles, off-road vehicles, racecars, or other similar vehicles is also a recreational vehicle. Where a recreational vehicle is on or attached to such a trailer, they shall together be considered one recreational vehicle. A recreational vehicle shall not include a pickup truck used for transportation to which a camper shell has been attached.
b.
A recreational vehicle may be kept, stored, parked, maintained, or otherwise permitted on a lot or parcel of land in Zones A-1, A-2, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-A, and RPD subject to the following restrictions:
i.
A recreational vehicle shall not be kept, stored, parked, maintained, or otherwise permitted within five feet of the front lot line or corner side lot line;
ii.
No portion of a recreational vehicle exceeding 36 inches in height shall be kept, stored, parked, maintained, or otherwise permitted within 10 feet of the front lot line or corner side lot line;
iii.
No more than one recreational vehicle may be kept, stored, parked, maintained, or otherwise permitted in the front yard, corner side yard, or any additional area situated between the corner side yard and the rear lot line;
iv.
No recreational vehicle shall be kept, stored, parked, maintained, or otherwise permitted in a manner that prevents access to any required covered parking on the same lot or parcel of land;
v.
A recreational vehicle may be kept, stored, parked, maintained, or otherwise permitted only on premises owned or occupied by the owner of the vehicle;
vi.
No disabled or otherwise nonfunctional recreational vehicle shall be kept, stored, parked, maintained, or otherwise permitted in the front yard or corner side yard;
vii.
A recreational vehicle shall be kept, stored, parked, maintained, or otherwise permitted so as to maintain unobstructed line-of-sight for pedestrians and motorists using the public right-of-way; and

A recreational vehicle shall be kept, stored, parked, maintained, or otherwise permitted so as not to constitute a health or safety hazard.
c.
A yard modification may be filed with the director pursuant to Section 22.48.180 to authorize the parking or storing of a recreational vehicle within 10 feet of the front lot line or corner side lot line; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall a recreational vehicle be parked closer than five feet from the front or corner side lot lines. An application for a yard modification under this subsection shall be supported by evidence substantiating that the requested modification is necessary due to topographic features or other conditions in that compliance with the 10-foot setback line would create an unnecessary hardship or unreasonable regulation or where it is obviously impractical to require compliance with the setback line. The director may approve a yard modification if the director finds that parking or storing a recreational vehicle at the proposed location will not compromise pedestrian or motorist line-of-sight or other applicable safety standards as determined by the director, and that the applicant has substantiated to the satisfaction of the director that, due to topographic features or other conditions, compliance with the 10-foot setback line would create an unnecessary hardship or unreasonable regulation or where it is obviously impractical to require compliance with the setback line.
E.

Additional Standards. The construction of residential units on a lot or parcel of land of less than one (1) acre within a small lot subdivision shall be subject to the following development standards:
(A)
For the construction of residential units on a lot or parcel of land of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more, the maximum gross structural area shall be equal to twenty (20) percent of the area of the lot or parcel. Construction of residential units on a lot or parcel of land of less than five thousand (5,000) square feet shall be subject to the following slope intensity formula:
(1)
The maximum allowable gross structural area of a residential unit to be constructed on a building site shall be determined by the following formula:
GSA = (A/5) x [(50-S)/35] + 500
Where:
A = the area of the building site in square feet. The building site is defined by the applicant and may consist of all or a designated portion of the one or more lots comprising the project location. All permitted structures must be located within the designated building site.
S = the average slope of the building site in percent as calculated by the formula:
S = I x L/A x 100
Where:
S = average natural slope in percent.
I = contour interval in feet, at not greater than twenty-five (25)-foot intervals, resulting in at least five (5) contour lines.
L = total accumulated length of all contour lines of interval "I" in feet.
A = the area of the building site in square feet.
(2)
All slope calculations shall be based on natural, not graded conditions. Maps of a scale generally not less than one (1) inch equals ten (10) feet (1"=10'), showing the building site and existing slopes, prepared by a licensed surveyor or registered professional civil engineer, shall be submitted with the application. If slope is greater than fifty (50) percent, enter fifty (50) for S in the GSA formula.
(3)
The maximum allowable GSA as calculated above may be increased as follows:
(a)
Add five hundred (500) square feet or twelve and one-half (12.5) percent of the total lot area, whichever is less, for each lot which is contiguous to the designated building site, provided that such lot(s) is (are) combined with the building site, and all potential for residential development on such lot(s) is permanently extinguished.
(b)
Add three hundred (300) square feet or seven and one-half (7.5) percent of the total lot area, whichever is less, for each lot in the vicinity of (e.g., in the same small lot subdivision) but not contiguous with the designated building site, provided that such lot(s) is (are) combined with other developed or developable building sites and all potential for residential development on such lot(s) is permanently extinguished.
(4)
The floor area requirement for single-family residences contained in Section 22.20.105 shall not apply.
(5)
All residences approved in small lot subdivisions by the slope intensity formula shall be subject to an improvement condition requiring that any future additions or improvements to the property shall be subject to an additional review by the director.

APPENDIX FOR SECTION 22.44.133
SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS NORTH AREA
COMMUNITY STANDARDS DISTRICT
CRITERIA FOR SIGNIFICANT RIDGELINES
The designation of the significant ridgelines within the Santa Monica Mountains North Area Community Standards District is based on the following criteria:
* Topographic complexity: Ridges that have a significant difference in elevation from the valley or canyon floor. Generally, these ridges are observable from any location on the valley floor, from a community, or from a public road. Geologic conditions in the Santa Monica Mountains North Area make this a common condition.
* Near/far contrast: Ridges that are a part of a scene that includes a prominent landform in the foreground and a major backdrop ridge with an unbroken skyline. This includes a view into a valley from a public road or viewpoint located at a higher altitude, such as along the valley rim or a pass. Often, layers of ridges are visible into the distance, such as when looking west from Topanga Canyon Boulevard over Henry Ridge to Saddle Peak, and from Mulholland Highway looking east toward Cornell and Malibu Lake. This contrast can be experienced viewing an entire panorama or a portion of a panorama from an elevated point.
* Cultural landmarks: Ridges that frame views of well-known locations, structures, or other places, which are considered points of interest in the Santa Monica Mountains North Area. These landmarks include Paramount Ranch, Peter Strauss Ranch, and Malibu Lake.
* Uniqueness and character of a specific location: Peaks and their buttressing ridges. This is represented by ridges that frame rocky outcroppings, other unique geological features, and areas of extraordinary natural beauty, such as Ladyface Mountain and Saddle Rock. Ridges that frame Malibu Canyon-Las Virgenes Road—a state-designated county scenic highway—Mulholland Highway, Kanan Road, Topanga Canyon Boulevard, and other scenic routes are also included.
* Existing community boundaries and gateways: Ridges and surrounding terrain that provide the first view of predominantly natural, undeveloped land as a traveler emerges from the urban landscape. These lands introduce visitors to the visual experiences they will encounter in the Santa Monica Mountains North Area. Community boundaries and gateways include the surrounding ridges that provide a skyline and boundary to the rural communities found in the North Area. Examples include the ridges viewed from the Ventura Freeway traveling west from Calabasas, and the ridges along Triunfo and Lobo Canyons.

4.
Modifications. The director, hearing officer or commission, where applicable, in acting upon any application for a modification from the development standards of this section, shall consider, in addition to the principles and standards in Section 22.56.1090, the unique characteristics of the neighborhood in which the site is located. Approval or denial of a modification shall not establish precedent for approval or denial of other modifications within the East Pasadena-San Gabriel Community Standards District. Except for parking and sign regulations, the development standards in this section may only be modified by director's review and approval pursuant to Part 12 of Chapter 22.56 and in accordance with the following:
a.
When an application for a tentative map for a subdivision, including a minor land division, is filed concurrently with an application to modify development standards, the provisions of Section 22.56.1700 shall apply to such applications;
b.
In cases where Section 22.56.1700 does not apply, the director's review and approval shall be subject to the following additional provisions:

APPENDIX FOR SECTION 22.44.144
SAN FRANCISQUITO CANYON COMMUNITY STANDARDS DISTRICT CRITERIA FOR SIGNIFICANT RIDGELINES
The designation of the significant ridgelines within the San Francisquito Canyon Community Standards District is based on the following criteria:
•  Topographic complexity: Ridges that have a significant difference in elevation from the valley or canyon floor. Generally, these ridges can be seen from any location on the valley floor, from a community or neighborhood, or from a public road.
•  Near/far contrast: Ridges that are part of a scene that includes a prominent landform in the foreground and a major backdrop ridge with an unbroken skyline. This includes a view into a valley from a public road or viewpoint located at a higher altitude, such as along the valley rim or a pass. This contrast can be experienced viewing an entire panoramic view or a portion of a panoramic view from an elevated point.
•  Cultural landmarks: Ridges that frame views of well-known locations, structures, or other places which are considered points of interest within the community or region.
•  Uniqueness and character of a specific location: Peaks and their buttressing ridges. This is represented by ridges that frame rocky outcroppings, other unique geological features, and areas of extraordinary natural beauty.
•  Existing community boundaries and gateways: Ridges and surrounding terrain that provide the first view of predominantly natural, undeveloped land as a traveler emerges in the community. These lands introduce visitors to the visual experiences they will encounter in the community and gateways include the surrounding ridges that provide a skyline and boundary to the community.

Part 9 - RURAL OUTDOOR LIGHTING DISTRICT
Sections:

22.44.500 - Purpose.
The rural outdoor lighting district is established as a supplemental district for the rural areas of the County to promote and maintain dark skies for the health and enjoyment of individuals and wildlife by:
A.
Curtailing light pollution and preserving the nighttime environment.
B.
Permitting reasonable uses of outdoor lighting for nighttime safety, security, productivity, and enjoyment, while protecting the natural environment from the adverse effects of excessive outdoor nighttime lighting from artificial sources.
C.
Conserving energy and resources.
D.
Minimizing adverse offsite impacts of outdoor lighting, such as light trespass.
(Ord. 2012-0047 § 9, 2012)
22.44.510 - Definitions.
A.
Abandoned use. A use which has been discontinued and/or its structure has been abandoned and there is no indication that any use or occupancy of the structure will resume.
B.
Accurate color rendition. The accurate representation of colors provided by an artificial light source.
C.
Drop-down lens. A lens or diffuser that extends below a horizontal plane passing through the lowest point of the opaque portion of a light fixture.
D.
Foot-candle. A unit of measurement that shows the quantity of light received on a surface. Foot-candles shall be measured by a photometer.
E.
Fully shielded. A light fixture is fully shielded when it emits no light in the area above a horizontal plane passing through the lowest point of the light fixture and no more than 10 percent of its light in the area between zero and 10 degrees below the horizontal plane. A full-cutoff light (flat glass lens) fixture is a fully shielded light fixture of a specific design, usually with a box or oval shape and a flat bottom.
F.
Light pollution. Any adverse effect of artificial lighting including glare, light trespass, obtrusive light, sky glow, or other lighting impacts on the nocturnal environment.
G.
Light fixture. Light fixture is the structure used to produce an artificial light source, including all of its necessary auxiliary components. Examples of a light structure include a lamp, pole, post, ballast, reflector, lens, diffuser, shielding, bulb, and related electrical wiring.
H.
Light trespass. The falling of light across a property line onto an adjoining lot or public right-of-way. The measurement of light trespass shall be determined by a photometer, taken at ground level from the subject property line. For purposes of this Part 9, an unacceptable level of light trespass shall be 0.5 (half) foot-candles or greater when the light trespass falls onto an adjoining public right-of-way or an adjoining residentially-zoned lot, open space zoned lot, or agriculturally-zoned lot, and 1.0 (one) foot-candle or greater when the light trespass falls onto an adjoining lot with any other zoning classification.
I.
Lumen (lm). A unit of light energy or the visual amount of light produced by a light fixture, calculated as a rating by the manufacturer (distinct from a watt, which measures power consumption). For example, a 40-watt incandescent lamp produces approximately 400 lumens, and a 35-watt, high-pressure sodium lamp produces 2,300 lumens.
J.
Major addition. The cumulative addition of 25 percent or more of gross floor area, seating capacity, parking spaces, or number of dwelling units to any structure, building, or development; except in the coastal zone, where a cumulative addition of 10 percent or more of gross floor area, seating capacity, parking spaces, or number of dwelling units to any structures, buildings, or development shall constitute a major addition.
K.
Outdoor lighting. Lighting equipment or light fixtures used to provide illumination for outdoor areas, objects, or activities, including light fixtures attached to buildings or structures. Self-supporting structures to provide lighting for parking lots, walkways, building entrances, outdoor sales areas, recreational fields, or within landscaped areas shall all constitute outdoor lighting.
L.
Outdoor recreational activity area. An area designed for active outdoor recreation, whether publicly or privately owned, including, but not limited to, sports fields, race tracks, stadiums, and riding arenas. The accessory uses to these areas, including parking lots and concessions stands, shall not be considered part of the involved outdoor recreational activity area.
M.
Sky glow. The brightening of the nighttime sky resulting from outdoor light reflecting into or toward the sky, and combining with moisture and/or dust particles in the atmosphere to cause light pollution.
N.
Street Lights. Pole-mounted light fixtures used to illuminate public or private rights-of-way and to enhance the safe movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.

B.
Hours of operation.
1.
Outdoor lighting shall be turned off between the hours of 10:00 p.m., and sunrise every day, unless the use on the involved property operates past 10:00 p.m., and then the outdoor lighting shall be turned off within one hour after the use's operation ends for the day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the use on the involved property requires outdoor lighting between 10:00 p.m., and sunrise every day for safety or security reasons, outdoor lighting shall be allowed during these hours, but only if:
a.
Fully-shielded motion sensors are used to turn the outdoor lighting on after 10:00 p.m., and these sensors turn the outdoor lighting off automatically no more than 10 minutes after the involved area has been vacated; or
