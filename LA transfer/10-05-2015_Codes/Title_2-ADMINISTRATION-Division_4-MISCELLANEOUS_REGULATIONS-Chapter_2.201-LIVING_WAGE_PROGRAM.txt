Chapter 2.201 - LIVING WAGE PROGRAM
Sections:

2.201.010 - Findings.
The board of supervisors finds that the county of Los Angeles is the principal provider of social and health services within the county, especially to persons who are compelled to turn to the county for such services. Employers' failure to pay a living wage to their employees causes them to use such services thereby placing an additional burden on the county of Los Angeles.
