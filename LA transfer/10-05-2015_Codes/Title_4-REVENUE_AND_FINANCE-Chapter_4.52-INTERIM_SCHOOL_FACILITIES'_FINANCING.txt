When the board of supervisors concurs with a school district's findings that conditions of overcrowding exist within an attendance area, it shall notify the department of public works and the planning department of said concurrence and of the geographical boundaries of such attendance area. Upon receipt of such notification by the board, the department of public works shall not issue a building permit, or in the case of an installation of a mobilehome or the construction of a mobilehome park, a utility permit (for example, electrical, sewer, plumbing, construction, etc.) within the attendance area until it has received a written "certificate of completion" from the affected school district.

The schedule shall include the school sites to be used, the classroom facilities to be made available, and the times when such facilities will be available.

Upon receipt of payment, the school district shall issue its certificate of completion of requirements under the ordinance for interim school facilities' financing.
B.
Where land is to be made available, the developer shall provide a recordable written agreement to the school district which grants to the school district exclusive use of the land acceptable to the school district for an interim period. This written agreement shall be provided to the school district prior to the issuance of a building permit, or in the case of an installation of a mobilehome or the construction of a mobilehome park, a utility permit (for example, electrical, sewer, plumbing, construction, etc.). Upon receiving the recordable agreement, the school district shall issue its certificate of completion.
C.
If the school district determines that the requirement for land or fees in lieu thereof would result in an equitable duplication of land or fees previously provided by the developer or his predecessors in interest, the school district shall adjust the requirement to the extent necessary to eliminate such duplication.
