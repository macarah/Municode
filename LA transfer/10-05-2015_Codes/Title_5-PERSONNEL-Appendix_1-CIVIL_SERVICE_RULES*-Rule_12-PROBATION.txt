Rule 12 - PROBATION
Rules:

12.01 - Probationary period.
A.
After each permanent appointment from an eligible list an employee shall serve a complete period of probation before appointment or probation is complete.
B.
Upon reinstatement of an employee after separation or upon restoration of an employee pursuant to Rule 17, or upon a voluntary change of classification, the appointing power may require such employee to serve a probationary period pursuant to Rule 12.02 before the appointment is complete. In such case, the appointing power shall so notify the employee in writing at time of appointment, with a copy to the director of personnel. In the case of reinstatement, the probationer shall be treated as though serving a first probationary period, and may be discharged or reduced. In the case of restoration, the probationer may be reduced.
C.
No new probationary period results from a transfer, or reduction of an employee who previously completed a probationary period in that class or a change in classification other than voluntary. In no case shall a person be required to serve an additional probationary period when appointed from a reemployment list to a permanent position of the same or lower level than that from which the person was laid off and had satisfactorily completed a prior probationary period.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
12.02 - Length of probationary period.
A.
The period of probation shall be no less than six nor more than 12 calendar months from the date of appointment to a permanent position, as established by the director of personnel for each class.
B.
If an employee is absent from duty during a probationary period, the appointing power may calculate the probationary period on the basis of actual service exclusive of the time away. If a change in the probationary period is made, the employee shall be notified prior to the end of the original probationary period.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
12.03 - Interruption of probationary period.
A.
Whenever the probationary period of an employee is interrupted due to an appointment to another class and the employee subsequently returns to the original class during the second probationary period, the appointing power shall require the employee to serve either a full probationary period or the balance of the original probationary period before the appointment is complete. In such case, the appointing power shall so notify the employee in writing at the time of the employee's return to the original class with a copy to the director of personnel.
B.
Reduction, during a probationary period to a class of positions not previously held, starts a new period of probation.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
12.04 - Credit for temporary or recurrent service.
Temporary and recurrent employees working on a full-time continuous basis may be credited with all or a portion of that time toward fulfillment of the probationary period required when appointed to a permanent position in the same class. Time credited may total an entire probationary period or any part of a probationary period required by Civil Service Rule 12.01. The department head may take this action only in those cases and for that time for which the employee's last performance evaluation bears the rating of "competent" or better and the employee's assignment and training have approximated that of a probationary employee in the same class.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
12.05 - Reviews and appeals.
If an employee is given notice of a probationary period which the employee believes is in violation of this Rule, such employee may appeal through the established grievance procedure in the department, or through the grievance procedure contained in any memorandum of understanding in effect between the county and the certified employee organization for the employee's class.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
