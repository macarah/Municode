A.
As part of the Board of Supervisors' duty to supervise the official conduct of the Sheriff under Government Code section 25303, the Office of Inspector General ("OIG") is created in the department of the Board of Supervisors. The OIG is created to facilitate the Board of Supervisors' responsibility without interfering with the Sheriff's investigative functions. The OIG shall focus on matters relevant to department-wide policies and procedures and shall not interfere with criminal, personnel, and other investigations by the Sheriff's Department.
B.
The OIG shall provide independent and comprehensive oversight, monitoring of, and reporting about the Sheriff's Department and its jail facilities as set forth in this Section under the leadership of an Inspector General appointed by the Board of Supervisors.
C.
The OIG shall have four primary functions: (1) monitoring the Sheriff's Department's operations, conditions in the jail facilities, and the Sheriff's Department's response to inmate and public complaints related to the Sheriff's Department operations; (2) periodically reviewing the Sheriff's Department's use of force patterns, trends, and statistics, the Sheriff's Department's investigations of force incidents and allegations of misconduct, and the Sheriff's Department's disciplinary decisions; (3) reviewing the quality of audits and inspections conducted by the Sheriff's Department and conducting its own periodic audits and inspections; and (4) regularly communicating with the public, the Board of Supervisors, and the Sheriff's Department regarding the Sheriff's Department's operations. Complaints relating to specific conduct shall be referred, with the permission of the complainant, to the Sheriff's Department for action pursuant to Penal Code section 832.5.
D.
Without interfering with the Sheriff's investigative functions, the OIG shall have the authority to investigate specific incidents involving Sheriff's Department personnel only in the following circumstances:
(1)
when requested by, or with authorization of, the Sheriff;
(2)
when the Inspector General determines that the Sheriff's Department has not adequately investigated an incident; provided, however, that the Inspector General shall first meet and confer with the Sheriff and afford the Sheriff's Department the opportunity to investigate the incident further before the OIG conducts an investigation pursuant to this subpart; or
(3)
when the Board of Supervisors makes a formal request to the Inspector General for privileged legal advice pertaining to a claim or lawsuit arising out of the actions of the Sheriff's Department or its personnel.
E.
The Inspector General shall report directly to, and serve as an agent of, the Board of Supervisors and shall make regular reports to the Board of Supervisors on the Sheriff's Department's operations. Such reports to the Board of Supervisors shall be public reports, except to the extent they relate to confidential personnel or otherwise privileged matters. The OIG shall work under the direction of the Inspector General, who shall be an attorney licensed by the State Bar of California. The Inspector General shall serve as special counsel to the Board of Supervisors and have an attorney-client relationship with the Board of Supervisors when requested by the Board to provide privileged legal advice pertaining to a claim or lawsuit arising out of the actions of the Sheriff's Department or its personnel.
F.
The Sheriff's Department and all other County departments shall cooperate with the OIG and promptly supply any information or records requested by the OIG, including confidential peace officer personnel records necessary for the OIG to carry out its duties; provided, however, that the OIG shall not have the authority to compel Sheriff's Department personnel involved in a specific incident to respond to questions concerning that incident without the authorization of the Sheriff.
G.
The confidentiality of peace officer personnel records and all other privileged or confidential information received by the OIG in connection with the discharge of the OIG's duties shall be safeguarded and maintained by the OIG as required by law or as necessary to maintain any applicable privileges or the confidentiality of the information. The OIG shall not disclose, without the Sheriff's authorization, any of the Sheriff's Department's confidential personnel, investigative, or disciplinary information unless such information is already a matter of public record or the disclosure is to the Board of Supervisors in response to a formal request by the Board of Supervisors for privileged legal advice pertaining to a claim or lawsuit arising out of the actions of the Sheriff's Department or its personnel.
