  Notes to Table 2306.4.1
For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 pound per foot = 14.5939 N/m.
a.  For framing of other species: (1) Find specific gravity for species of lumber in AF&PA NDS. (2) For nails find shear value from table above for nail size for actual grade and multiply value by the following adjustment factor: Specific Gravity Adjustment Factor = [1-(0.5-SG)], where SG = Specific Gravity of the framing lumber. This adjustment factor shall not be greater than 1.
b.  Panel edges backed with 2-inch nominal or thicker framing. Install panels either horizontally or vertically. Space fasteners maximum 6 inches on center along intermediate framing members for 3/8-inch and 7/16-inch panels installed on studs spaced 24 inches on center. For other conditions and panel thickness, space fasteners maximum 12 inches on center on intermediate supports.
c.  3/8-inch panel thickness or siding with a span rating of 16 inches on center is the minimum recommended where applied direct to framing as exterior siding.
d.  Allowable shear values are permitted to be increased to values shown for 15/32-inch sheathing with same nailing provided (a) studs are spaced a maximum of 16 inches on center, or (b) panels are applied with long dimension across studs.
e.  Framing at adjoining panel edges shall be 3 inches nominal or thicker, and nails shall be staggered where nails are spaced 2 inches on center.
f.  Framing at adjoining panel edges shall be 3 inches nominal or thicker, and nails shall be staggered where both of the following conditions are met: (1) 10d (3"x0.148") nails having penetration into framing of more than 1-1/2 inches and (2) nails are spaced 3 inches on center.
g.  Values apply to all-veneer plywood. Thickness at point of fastening on panel edges governs shear values.
h.  Where panels applied on both faces of a wall and nail spacing is less than 6 inches o.c. on either side, panel joints shall be offset to fall on different framing members, or framing shall be 3-inch nominal or thicker at adjoining panel edges and nails on each side shall be staggered.
i.  In Seismic Design Category D, E or F, where shear design values exceed 350 pounds per linear foot, all framing members receiving edge nailing from abutting panels shall not be less than a single 3-inch nominal member, or two 2-inch nominal members fastened together in accordance with Section 2306.1 to transfer the design shear value between framing members. Wood structural panel joint and sill plate nailing shall be staggered in all cases. See Section 2305.3.11 for sill plate size and anchorage requirements.
j.  Galvanized nails shall be hot dipped or tumbled.
k.  Reserved.
l.  For shear loads of normal or permanent load duration as defined by the AF&PA NDS, the values in the table above shall be multiplied by 0.63 or 0.56, respectively.
m.  [DSA-SS & OSHPD 1, 2 and 4] Refer to Section 2305.2.4.2, which requires any wood structural panel sheathing used for diaphragms and shear walls that are part of the seismic-force-resisting system to be applied directly to framing members.

  Notes to Table 2306.4.5
For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 25.4 mm, 1 pound per foot = 14.5939 N/m.
a.  These shear walls shall not be used to resist loads imposed by masonry or concrete construction (see Section 2305.1.5). Values shown are for short-term loading due to wind or seismic loading. Walls resisting seismic loads shall be subject to the limitations in Section 12.2.1 of ASCE 7. Values shown shall be reduced 25 percent for normal loading.
b.  Applies to fastening at studs, top and bottom plates and blocking.
c.  Alternate fasteners are permitted to be used if their dimensions are not less than the specified dimensions. Drywall screws are permitted to substitute for the 5d (1-5/8" x 0.086"), and 6d (1-7/8" x 0.092")(cooler) nails listed above, and No. 6 1-1/4 inch Type S or W screws for 6d (1-7/8" x 0.092")(cooler) nails.
d.  For properties of cooler nails, see ASTM C 514.
e.  Except as noted, shear values are based on maximum framing spacing of 16 inches on center.
f.  Maximum framing spacing of 24 inches on center.
g.  All edges are blocked, and edge fastening is provided at all supports and all panel edges.
h.  First number denotes fastener spacing at the edges; second number denotes fastener spacing at intermediate framing members.
i.  Screws are Type W or S.
j.  Staples shall have a minimum crown width of 7/16 inch, measure outside the legs, and shall be installed with their crowns parallel to the long dimension of the framing members.
k.  Staples for the attachment of gypsum loath and woven-wire lath shall have a minimum crown width of ¾ inch, measured outside the legs.
l.  This construction shall not be used below the top level of wood construction in a multi-level building.
