Chapter 5.90 - VEHICLE TRIP REDUCTION—RIDESHARING
Sections:

5.90.010 - General.
This chapter sets forth the actions department heads which supervise County employees at any County worksite of one hundred or more employees must take to promote County employee participation in trip reduction and ridesharing programs. These programs are intended to reduce traffic congestion and air emissions from vehicles used for commuting between home and the worksite. This chapter also is intended to establish requirements at least as effective as Rule 2202 of the South Coast Air Quality Management District ("SCAQMD") in increasing Average Vehicle Ridership at County worksites.
(Ord. 2012-0027 § 1, 2012: Ord. 90-0042 § 1 (part), 1990.)
5.90.020 - Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions apply:
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions apply:
A.
"Alternate transportation" means the use of non-motor vehicle modes of transportation. Walking and bicycling are examples.
B.
"Average Vehicle Ridership (AVR)" means the figure derived by dividing the employee population at a given worksite that reports to work weekdays between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. by the number of vehicles* driven by these employees commuting from home to the worksite during these hours. The AVR is calculated using a weekly averaging period. The applicable employee population is multiplied by the number of weekdays in the selected averaging period, then divided by the total number of vehicles driven by these employees to the worksite during the same period.
C.
"Central City Area (CCA)," also known as Performance Zone 1, means the Los Angeles City area bounded as described below:
1.
By the Santa Monica Freeway (Route 10) from Union Avenue to Alameda Street;
2.
Alameda Street from the Santa Monica Freeway to Sunset Boulevard;
3.
Sunset Boulevard from Alameda Street to the Harbor Freeway (Route 110);
4.
The Harbor Freeway from Sunset Boulevard to the Hollywood Freeway (Route 101);
5.
The Hollywood Freeway to Temple Street;
6.
Temple Street from Belmont Avenue to Union Avenue; and

F.
"Employee" means any person employed by the County.
G.
"Employee Transportation Coordinator ("ETC") means a person who has completed a training program in transportation management approved by the SCAQMD's Trip Reduction Training Coordinator Advisory Committee. The training program must include, but need not be limited to: review of available commuter matching resources and services, detailed explanation of the eligible activities listed in Section 5.90.030D, explanation of the relationship between transportation management and air quality, and guidance in developing a trip reduction plan. The CEO will provide a list of training programs developed by the Trip Reduction Training Coordinator Advisory Committee to each department head subject to the ordinance codified in this chapter.
H.
"Ridesharing" means the cooperative effort of two or more people traveling together. Utilization of carpools, vanpools, buspools, taxipools, trains and public transit are all methods of ridesharing.

J.
"Source/receptor areas" means areas established by the SCAQMD based on air monitoring and geographical and meteorological factors. A source area is that area in which air contaminants are discharged. A receptor area is an area in which the contaminants accumulate and are measured. An area can be a source area, a receptor area, or both. The map in Exhibit 5.90.030 shows the source/receptor areas established by the SCAQMD.
K.
"Telework" means an alternate method of work where the employee, also known as the Teleworker, works from home or a location closer to their home like a branch office.
L.
"Worksite" means a building or grouping of buildings located within the County which are in actual physical contact or separated solely by a private or public roadway or other private or public right-of-way, which is owned or operated by the County, and which is the location of employment of one hundred or more employees.

5.90.030 - Increase in average vehicle ridership.
A.
Within ninety days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the CEO shall prepare an Employee Commute Reduction Plan ("ECRP") applicable to each department head who supervises employees at a worksite which shall meet the requirements of this chapter.
B.
The ECRP must specify the measures the department head will take to achieve the specified AVR for employee vehicles subject to the ordinance. SCAQMD AVR targets are:
1.
1.75 AVR in Performance Zone 1, which is comprised of the Central City Area of Source Receptor Area 1;
