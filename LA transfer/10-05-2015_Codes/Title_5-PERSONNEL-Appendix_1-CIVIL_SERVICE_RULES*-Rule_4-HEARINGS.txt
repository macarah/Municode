Rule 4 - HEARINGS
Rules:

4.01 - Right to petition for a hearing.
Any employee or applicant for employment may petition for a hearing before the commission who is:
A.
Adversely affected by any action or decision of the director of personnel concerning which discrimination is alleged as provided in Rule 25;
B.
Adversely affected by any action or decision of the commission made without notice to and opportunity for such person to be heard other than a commission decision denying a petition for hearing;
C.
Otherwise entitled to a hearing under the Charter or these Rules.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
4.02 - Petition for hearing.
Such petition shall be in writing, signed by the petitioner, or the petitioner's representative, and shall give the signer's mailing address and specify the ruling or action appealed and in plain language and in detail sufficient facts and reasons upon which the petitioner's case is based.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988: amended by Board Order No. 80 (part), 9/1/87.)
4.03 - Action on petition for hearing.
A.
In cases of discharge or reduction of a permanent employee other than a probationary employee covered by the provisions of Rule 18, or suspension in excess of five days, a timely petition for hearing shall be granted if it states sufficient specific facts and reasons in support of the employee's appeal as provided in Rule 18.02. The petition shall be denied if such facts and reasons are not stated.
B.
In all other cases provided for in Rule 4.01, the commission may, at its discretion, grant a hearing or make its decision on the merits based on a review of written materials submitted by the parties concerned. The commission shall deny both a request for a hearing and a review of written materials if the petition fails to state sufficient specific facts and reasons, or if, in the opinion of the commission, the specific facts and reasons stated, if true, would not entitle the petitioner to any relief. Moreover, no hearing need be granted if the commission is of the opinion, based on the moving papers and any responses thereto, that the petitioner is not likely to prevail on the merits of the petition. No amended petition shall be considered if it is not filed within 10 business days of the date of denial of the original petition. No more than one amended petition may be filed by the petitioner.
C.
When granting a hearing, the commission shall state the specific issue(s) in the petition to be heard and will notify all the parties in writing of the issue(s). No other issues shall be heard.
D.
The commission shall give written notice to the petitioning party and the representative of record and the department of the date, place and time of the commission meeting at which the petition shall be considered. Each petitioning party and the department shall have the responsibility of serving the documents on which they rely on the opposing party. If either party does not serve the documents on the opposing party, the commission shall, at the request of the party not served, continue the matter for two weeks for immediate service of said documents and the opposing party's right to respond to the "new" documents before considering the entire petition on its merits. In cases of discharge, reduction and, when appropriate, suspensions, such continuance if caused by the petitioner's failure to serve documents shall require a waiver of salary by the petitioner for a period of time equivalent to the length of time of the continuance.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988: amended by Board Order No. 80 (part), 9/1/87.)
4.05 - Time within which petition must be filed.
A.
Unless otherwise provided in these Rules, a petition for hearing before the commission must be filed within the following time limits:
1.
In a discharge, reduction or suspension over five days within 15 business days after service of letter of discharge, reduction or suspension of over five days;
2.
In all other matters except as provided in Rule 6.07, not later than 10 business days after the ruling or order complained of.
B.
Commission may extend the time limits for filing a petition only after consideration of a showing of good cause for the delay which has been submitted in writing. If the commission extends the time limits, the commission shall specify the facts which the commission deems to constitute good cause. The filing of a departmental grievance or an appeal in another jurisdiction, such as the Employee Relations Commission, shall not constitute good cause for extending the time limits for filing a petition with the commission.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988: amended by Board Order No. 80 (part), 9/1/87.)
4.06 - Hearing board or officer.
On granting a petition for hearing, the president of the commission shall assign it either to one or more hearing officers.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
4.07 - Rights of petitioner.
A.
When a hearing is granted, the petitioner shall attend, unless excused by the commission, or by the hearing board, and shall be entitled to:
1.
Be represented by counsel or by a representative;
2.
Testify under oath or affirmation;
3.
Subpoena witnesses;
4.
Cross-examine witnesses;
5.
Cross-examine all employees of the commission or of the director of personnel who have investigated any of the matters involved in the case and whose reports are offered in evidence before the commission or hearing board;
6.
Impeach any witness before the commission or hearing board;
7.
Present such affidavits, exhibits, and other evidence as the commission or hearing board deems pertinent to the inquiry;
8.
Argue the case.
B.
The appointing power, the director of personnel or other members of the commission staff, and any other person whom the commission or hearing board finds to be interested in the matter shall be entitled to the same privileges.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
4.08 - Appearance of petitioner.
A.
The appearance of the petitioner shall be required at all hearings except as otherwise provided herein:
1.
The appearance of the petitioner shall not be required where the commission has determined, pursuant to Rule 4.03, that a decision on the petition shall be made after a review of written materials submitted by all parties concerned;
2.
The commission or hearing board shall have discretion to consent to the absence of the petitioner upon a showing of good cause therefor.
B.
Unexcused absence of the petitioner at such a hearing shall be deemed a withdrawal of the petition and consent to the action or ruling from which the appeal was taken.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
4.09 - Closing briefs.
If closing briefs are to be submitted in a hearing, they must be submitted within 10 business days from the last session of the hearing. Late submission shall not be accepted or considered by the hearing board.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
4.10 - Evidence.
A.
The hearing shall be formal, but need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence or objection in civil actions.
B.
Hearsay evidence may be admitted for any purpose, but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The rules of privilege and of official or judicial notice shall be effective to the same extent as in civil actions. Irrelevant and repetitious evidence shall be excluded. Oral evidence shall be taken only under oath or affirmation.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
4.11 - Testimony of petitioner.
In hearings on discharges, reductions or suspensions in excess of five days, the petitioning employee shall not be required to testify, but may be cross-examined as to any matter relevant to the hearing if the petitioner takes the stand voluntarily. In any other type of hearing the petitioner may be called and examined as if under cross-examination.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
4.12 - Burden of proof.
In hearings on discharges, reductions or suspensions in excess of five days, the burden of proof shall be on the appointing power, except that the burden of proving affirmative defenses shall be on the person asserting them; provided that such raising of an affirmative defense does not relieve the appointing authority of its responsibility to sustain its burden of proof. In all other types of hearings the burden of proof shall be on the petitioner.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988: amended by Board Order No. 80 (part), 9/1/87.)
4.13 - Findings and decisions.
A.
If the hearing, as hereinbefore described, is not before the full commission, the hearing board shall, within 30 calendar days from the conclusion of the hearing, submit a written or oral report to the commission for its approval. If the commission accepts the findings of fact contained in such report, it need not read the record of the hearing. If the commission declines to accept such findings, it must read the record or hold a hearing de novo.
B.
When the commission has reached a proposed decision, it shall notify each party of that decision. Either party may then request findings of fact and conclusions of law by filing a written request with the commission. If a party files no such request with the commission within 10 business days after being notified of the proposed decision, that party shall be deemed to have waived the right to findings of fact and conclusions of law.
C.
If a party requests findings of fact and conclusions of law, the commission may either adopt the report of the hearing board as its proposed findings and conclusions, direct one of the parties to prepare proposed findings and conclusions, or draft its own findings and conclusions. Copies of the proposed findings or conclusions shall be served personally or by mail on each party. Where practicable, such service should be made within 15 business days of the receipt of the request.
D.
If either party files objections to the proposed findings and conclusions within the time specified above and the commission believes that the objections or parts thereof have validity, the commission shall amend the proposed findings and conclusions accordingly, and shall notify the parties that the amended findings and conclusions are a new proposed decision. Any party who has not previously filed objections shall have 10 business days from the date of the notice of the new proposed decision to file objections to that decision. The commission shall then consider those objections, and notify the parties of its final decision.
E.
If no party files objections to the proposed findings and conclusions within 10 business days after service, they shall constitute the final decision of the commission.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988: amended by Board Order No. 80 (part), 9/1/87.)
4.14 - Petitioner for judicial review.
A.
The provisions of Section 1094.6 of the California Code of Civil Procedure shall be applicable to any petition for judicial review of a decision of the commission suspending, reducing or discharging an officer or employee.
B.
Any such petition for judicial review shall be filed no later than the 90th day following the date the decision becomes final.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
4.15 - Report of hearings.
Hearings on discharges, reductions and suspensions in excess of five days shall be conducted with a stenographic reporter. The commission or hearing board may order that other hearings be reported when it deems it necessary or when some person interested in the hearing requests, at least one full business day before the day set for the hearing, that such hearing be reported and pays the cost of fee for such reporting as estimated by the commission.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
4.16 - Transcripts of hearings.
Transcripts of hearings shall be furnished to any person on payment of the cost of preparing such transcripts. When transcripts are provided by the employees of the civil service commission, the cost shall be determined by the auditor-controller. When transcripts are provided by an independent contractor the cost will be established by contract between the Los Angeles County and the reporting company. The transcript of the hearing shall be the official record of the hearing.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
4.17 - Pre-hearing conference.
A.
With respect to any matters set for hearing, both parties shall confer no later than 10 business days prior to the date for the hearing for the purpose of agreeing to a statement in writing setting forth the specific facts or contentions in issue. The facts or contentions in issue contained in the agreed statement must fall within the scope of the hearing, as defined by the commission in accordance with Rule 4.03C. The party having the burden of proof shall initiate the contact with the opposing party. The statement must be filed with the commission or hearing board not later than five business days prior to the hearing, and shall include an estimate of the time required for the hearing and a list of all witnesses intended to be called by both parties. The commission or hearing board may also require such additional matters in the written statement as it deems appropriate. The commission may issue such orders as are necessary to assure that both parties attend the pre-hearing conference and cooperate in preparation of the statement in writing. If either party does not attend the pre-hearing conference and participate in attempting the preparation of the statement in writing, the hearing board shall accept the statement of the other party as to the facts and contentions in issue to the extent such statement conforms to the scope of the hearing as defined by the commission in accordance with Rule 4.03C.
B.
If the parties fail to reach agreement, then each party must file a written statement with the hearing board. The hearing board or a member designated by the board shall resolve all disputes, and announce the resolution to the parties as the first term of business in the hearing. The issues heard and the evidence taken must fall within the scope agreed upon by the parties or announced by the hearing board. Parties may object to proposed commission findings of fact and conclusions of law on the basis of the failure of the hearing board to comply with this Rule. When the commission finds such objections to be valid, it shall make appropriate amendments to the proposed findings and conclusions.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
4.18 - Waiver of hearing.
Should any party entitled to be heard by the commission, either as a matter of right or as a matter within the commission's discretion, have filed before filing with the commission a petition based on substantially the same facts before the employee relations commission or made, a charge based on substantially the same facts under an arbitration provision of any valid memorandum of understanding, that party shall be deemed to have waived the right or opportunity to be heard by the commission. As to any such matters, the civil service commission will give full faith and credit to final decisions of the employee relations commission and to any final decision of an arbitrator made pursuant to a valid memorandum of understanding.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
4.19 - Commission rules.
Pursuant to Charter Section 34, the civil service commission shall adopt and amend rules to govern its own proceedings, and cause such rules to be published and distributed to all county departments and districts and all certified organizations. In case of conflict between these Rules and rules adopted by the commission, the provisions of these Rules shall prevail.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988: amended by Board Order No. 80 (part), 9/1/87.)
