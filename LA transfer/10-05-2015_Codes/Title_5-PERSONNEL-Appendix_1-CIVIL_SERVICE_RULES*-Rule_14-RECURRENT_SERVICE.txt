Rule 14 - RECURRENT SERVICE
Rules:

14.01 - Recurrent employment.
A.
A person may be employed in a recurrent position only for the duration of the recurrent work, and be retained in one class of position for no longer than 12 months' continuous service in the same department except that, with approval of the director of personnel, persons may be employed in the same position for an additional specified period of time upon written presentation of facts to justify an extension.
B.
Recurrent employees serve on an as-needed basis. A recurrent employee may be released at any time at the discretion of the appointing authority without receiving a performance evaluation. A recurrent employee released in this manner shall have no recurrent reemployment rights on any subsequent recurrent reemployment list.
C.
When recurrent employees are to be released at the end of a recurring employment need, as determined by the appointing authority, such release shall be made in the order determined by the appointing authority.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
14.02 - Recurrent list.
A.
The director of personnel shall, when appropriate, establish eligible lists for recurrent employment and maintain departmental or divisional recurrent reemployment lists by classes for each department employing persons on a recurrent-service basis.
B.
When recurrent employees are released at the end of a recurrent work period, the department head shall certify, in writing, those persons who may be considered for reemployment. Such list shall be kept on file by the department head. A copy shall be furnished to the certified employee organization representing the recurrent employees once a year upon written request to the department head by the certified organization. Such certified list shall constitute the recurrent reemployment list.
C.
Recurrent employees who may be considered for reemployment include only those persons who have performed in at least a "competent" manner. The names of all other persons shall not be certified; and such persons shall not be entitled to have their names placed on a reemployment list.
D.
When a recurrent appointment is to be made, the appointing power may appoint any one of those persons whose name appears on the departmental or divisional recurrent reemployment list who is available and willing to serve.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988: amended by Board Order No. 80 (part), 9/1/87.)
14.03 - Dropping names from recurrent reemployment list.
A.
The name of all persons on any recurrent reemployment list who have not been employed from that list for more than one year, or two years from a specific list where the recurrent service occurs biennially, shall be dropped from said list. Names on a recurrent reemployment list may be dropped, or withheld from appointment, for the same reasons and in the same manner as from an eligible list.
B.
When a person receives a permanent appointment in the county service, such person's name shall be dropped from all recurrent reemployment lists.
C.
The name of a recurrent employee which has been dropped by reasons of absence for one year, or two years where recurrent service occurs biennially, may be restored to the reemployment list within one year after being dropped from said list. Said restoration shall be to the same class of position as that occupied at the time the name was dropped.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
14.04 - Interchange of lists.
Whenever a department recurrent reemployment list is exhausted, the director of personnel may, at the request of the department, certify for appointment names of persons from recurrent reemployment lists for the same class of position in other departments, and appointments may be made therefrom.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
14.05 - Reviews and appeals.
Any person who is adversely affected by any action in violation of Rule 14 may request the director of personnel to review such action.

Such written request for review shall name the specific act complained of, and state reasons for the complaint and the remedy requested.
