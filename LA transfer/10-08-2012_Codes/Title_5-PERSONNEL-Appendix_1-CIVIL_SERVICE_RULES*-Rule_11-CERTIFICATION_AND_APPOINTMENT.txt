Rule 11 - CERTIFICATION AND APPOINTMENT
Rules:

11.01 - Certification and appointment from eligible list.
A.
In filling vacancies from an eligible list, the appointing authority shall make appointment from eligible lists certified by the director of personnel.
B.
The director of personnel shall assemble candidates into groups based on their weighted total score in the examination, for the purpose of grouping, scores shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. In the case of open competitive examinations, veteran's credit shall be added before assembling the candidates into groups.
C.
Ordinarily, passing candidates shall be assembled into separate groups having fixed ranges as follows:
EXPAND
Group 1 95%—100%
Group 2 89%—94%
Group 3 83%—88%
Group 4 77%—82%
Group 5 70%—76%
  D.
In any open competitive examination where the addition of veteran's credit points produces final candidate scores above 100 percent, a sixth group shall be created to include the eligible candidates. In instances where the director of personnel has established through a validation or other special study prior to the examination that another grouping procedure should be employed, the alternative procedure so defined may be used, providing that the procedure is described in the official examination bulletin.
E.
All appointments to positions in the classified service shall be made from the highest ranking group on such lists, except that when the highest ranking group does not include at least five persons who are available for appointment, the appointment may be made from the next highest group or groups to include at least five persons.

(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
11.03 - Selective certification.
A.
