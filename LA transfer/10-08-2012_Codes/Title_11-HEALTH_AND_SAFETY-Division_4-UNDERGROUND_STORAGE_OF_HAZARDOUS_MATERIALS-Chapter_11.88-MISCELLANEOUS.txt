Chapter 11.88 - MISCELLANEOUS
Sections:

11.88.010 - Disclaimer of liability.
The degree of protection required by this division is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. The standards set forth herein are minimal standards and this division does not imply that compliance will ensure that there will be no unauthorized discharge of hazardous material. This division shall not create liability on the part of the county, any officer or employee thereof for any damages that result from reliance on this division or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. All persons handling, storing, using, processing, and disposing of hazardous materials within the county should be and are advised to determine to their own satisfaction the level of protection in addition to that required by this division necessary or desirable to ensure that there is no unauthorized discharge of hazardous materials.
(Ord. 83-0208 § 1 (part), 1983: Ord. 83-0206U § 1 (part), 1983.)
11.88.020 - Guidelines and standards.
Guidelines and standards may be established by the director and shall be maintained in the office of the director and shall be available to the public. Such guidelines and standards, in the areas addressed therein, shall serve as an interpretation of this division.
(Ord. 97-0016 § 77, 1997: Ord. 83-0208 § 1 (part), 1983: Ord. 83-0206U § 1 (part), 1983.)
11.88.030 - Trade secrets.
A.
If an applicant or permittee believes that a request for information made by either the application form or otherwise pursuant to this division involves the release of a trade secret, the applicant or permittee shall so notify the director in writing. As used herein, "trade secret" shall have the meaning given to it by Section 6254(K) of the Government Code.
B.
Subject to the provisions of this section, the director shall protect from disclosure any trade secret coming into his possession when requested to do so in writing by the applicant or permittee. Any such trade secret shall not be disclosed to anyone without the consent of the applicant or permittee except:
1.
To an officer or employee of the county, the CUPA, the state of California, or the United States of America, in connection with the official duties of such officer or employee under any law for the protection of health, or to contractors with the county and their employees, if in the opinion of the director such disclosure is necessary and required for the satisfactory performance of a contract for performance of work or for protection of health; or
2.
To any physician where the physician determines that such information is necessary to the medical treatment of his or her patient.
C.
Information certified by appropriate officials of the United States, as necessarily kept secret for national defense purposes, shall be accorded the full protection against disclosure as specified by such official or in accordance with the laws of the United States.
D.
The provisions of this section shall not permit an applicant or permittee to refuse to disclose information required pursuant to this division to the director.
E.
The confidential treatment of the identity of such trade secret disclosed to the county does not apply where there has been any unauthorized discharge related to such trade secret material which is reportable in compliance with Chapter 11.76 or where such disclosure arises out of any official emergency response relating to the facility involving such trade secret information by public safety personnel of the county.
(Ord. 97-0016 § 78, 1997: Ord. 83-0208 § 1 (part), 1983: Ord. 83-0206U § 1 (part), 1983.)

A laboratory report alone is not sufficient for the District Health Officer to contact the patient or his potential contacts. The diagnosis of the attending physician is essential before such a contact is made. The District Officer should make every effort to discuss the case and the laboratory report with the physician to facilitate the diagnosis. (Exceptions: In venereal disease cases, the professional staff in Venereal Disease Control may contact the attending physician.)
SEC.2 - TELEPHONE REPORTS
Acute Communicable Disease Control staff may be reached during working hours at 974-7944. After working hours, on weekends or holidays, appropriate staff can be reached through the County operator at 974-1234.
A.
The District Health Registrar immediately telephones reports of the following cases or suspected cases to the Morbidity Unit:
Anthrax

F.
The Chief, Acute Communicable Disease Control, telephones or telegraphs reports of the following diseases to the State Department of Health: botulism, cholera, dengue, plague, relapsing fever (louse-borne), smallpox, typhus fever (louse-borne), yellow fever.
SEC.3 - CONFIDENTIAL MORBIDITY REPORTS (CMR)—PM 110
The CMR is a standard report form on which tuberculosis, venereal disease and other communicable diseases must be reported within 24 hours of the diagnosis. This report form, PM 110, was formerly SDH 262-222.
SEC. 4 - EPIDEMIOLOGIC CASE HISTORY
Certain communicable diseases required an epidemiologic investigation and must be reported on forms specific for the disease entity. The forms required are in Part IV of this manual under the "reporting procedures" for each disease. For diseases not requiring specific forms, the CD INVESTIGATION, H-1138 is used. This form may also be used for supplemental data in any disease. Examples of epidemiologic case history forms and the processing of these forms are covered in the ACUTE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE FORMS MANUAL, B-160.
NOTE: All Epidemiologic Case History forms must be filled out completely. This information is vital for decision-making at all levels, local, state and federal.
SEC. 5
(Reference: Section 2502, Title 17, California Administrative Code)
A.
Definition:
An outbreak is defined as an unusually high incidence of a disease in excess of normal expectancy in a given area or population group. One case of smallpox constitutes an outbreak, while several cases of measles, mumps or hepatitis in the population at large could be considered a normal occurrence. However, when these cases occur in a localized area of the community, a classroom, industry, apartment complex, hospital, etc., they would be considered outbreaks.
B.
General Procedures:
Knowledge of an outbreak of infectious or parasitic disease or infestation, whether or not reportable, is investigated by the District Health Officer and reported to the Chief, Acute Communicable Disease Control. When the outbreak occurs anywhere other than in a health care facility, it is reported on the GENERAL INVESTIGATION RECORD, SDH-262501.
C.
Health Care Facility Outbreaks:
Whoever receives knowledge of an outbreak initiates the CD OUTBREAK NOTICE—HEALTH CARE FACILITY, H-1163 and additionally, telephones Acute Communicable Disease Control when outbreak occurs in an acute care hospital.
1.
Acute Care Hospital. Because of complex licensure requirements and the involvement of multiple districts, the Acute Communicable Disease Control staff is responsible for the epidemiological investigation in these facilities.
2.
Convalescent Care Facility. The district Health Officer investigates and reports on the CD OUTBREAK INVESTIGATION—HEALTH CARE FACILITY, H-1164.
SEC. 6 - REPORTING OF UNUSUAL DISEASES
(Reference: Section 2503, Title 17, California Administrative Code)
When the District Health Officer encounters an unusual disease which warrants an investigation, he reports on the CD INVESTIGATION, H-1138.
Unusual diseases include but are not limited to cat scratch fever, echinococcosis, giardiasis, herpangina, histoplasmosis, rickettsialpox, toxoplasmosis and any unusual tropical infectious disease.
SEC. 7 - REPORTING A CONTACT OR POSSIBLE SOURCE OF INFECTION, OTHER THAN TUBERCULOSIS OR VENEREAL DISEASE, LOCATED OUTSIDE THE HEALTH DISTRICT OF THE CASE
A.
When the case and contact or possible source of infection reside in different districts in Los Angeles County, the Public Health Registrar in the district of the case notifies the district where the contact or possible source of infection resides
B.
When either the contact or possible source of infection is in another health jurisdiction out of Los Angeles County:
1.
The Public Health Registrar in the district of the case telephones the Morbidity Unit, who then notifies the other health jurisdiction.
2.
The Chief, Acute Communicable Disease Control, prepares any required correspondence.
SEC. 8 - CHANGE OF RESIDENCE OF PERSONS IN STRICT ISOLATION OR QUARANTINE INCLUDING COMMUNICABLE TUBERCULOSIS
When it is necessary for persons in strict isolation or quarantine to move, written permission is first obtained from the owner of the new premises or his agent. Inspection of the proposed residence must establish that it is or can be made suitable for isolation or quarantine. Moving into a multiple dwelling is evaluated individually considering the disease and situation; any change of residence is under the supervision of the District Health Officer of the Chief, Public Health Investigation.
All cases covered by this section must be reported immediately to the District Health Officer, and in cases of legal isolation and quarantine, to the Chief, Public Health Investigation.
SEC. 9 - CHANGE OF RESIDENCE OF PATIENTS WITH COMMUNICABLE DISEASE WHO ARE NOT ISOLATED OR QUARANTINED
A.
TUBERCULOSIS PATIENTS (Under treatment or needing further evaluation)
1.
Moving out of Los Angeles County. The District Nursing Director or her representative notifies the Tuberculosis Register. Where time is important, the District Nursing Director directly notifies the other health jurisdiction of the new residence.
Arrangements for continued care may be made by the District Nursing Director or District Director Public Health Social Worker by telephone or by a brief written statement.
2.
Moving to another health district in Los Angeles County. The District Nursing Director notifies the Tuberculosis Register. Arrangements for continued care are telephoned to the new health district and the chart transferred. (See Order 0603.)
B.
VENEREAL DISEASE PATIENTS
1.
Moving out of Los Angeles County. When a possibly contagious patient moves to another health jurisdiction, the responsible venereal disease interviewer records the new address on the VENEREAL DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REPORT, CDC 9.2936. Venereal Disease Control forwards this report to the other health jurisdiction of the new residence.
2.
Moving to another health district in Los Angeles County. Continued care is arranged by telephone and the chart transferred. The responsible venereal disease interviewer forwards VENEREAL DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REPORT, CDC 9.2936, to the new district and INTER-DISTRICT TRANSFER, NOTICE—VDER (2936), to Venereal Disease Control for syphilis cases and/or suspects. Whenever arrangements for patients described in B-1. and 2. have been made by telephone, this information, with the date of the call, is recorded on the reverse side of VENEREAL DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REPORT, CDC 9.2936.
3.
Non-infectious venereal disease cases. If a non-contagious patient in the venereal disease clinic moves to a new address in or out of Los Angeles County, his name will not be reported on VENEREAL DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REPORT, CDC-9.2936, unless his follow-up is indicated. If requested, these patients may be given information of facilities in the area of new residence.
C.
OTHER PATIENTS (Except tuberculosis or venereal disease patients).
1.
Moving out of Los Angeles County. Morbidity Unit is responsible for notifying the appropriated health jurisdiction.
2.
Moving to another health district in Los Angeles County. For cases previously reported, the District Public Health Registrar notifies only the new district. For cases not previously reported, the District Public Health Registrar telephones the new address to MORBIDITY UNIT and notifies the new district.
PART III
COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL MEASURES
SEC. 10 - EXAMINATION FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASE
Persons suspected of having a communicable disease are requested to contact their physicians or appear at a Department of Health Services clinic for examination. Failure to comply with this request must be reported to the Chief, Public Health Investigation.
SEC. 11 - SURVEILLANCE ORDERS ON INTERNATIONAL TRAVELERS
A.
Issuance
The United States Public Health Service may issue a SURVEILLANCE ORDER, HSM-13.17. (Center for Disease Control), to any traveler from a foreign country infected with smallpox, cholera, yellow fever, or plague, who meets any of the following criteria:
1.
Travelers who have an illness of unusual or severe nature which might possibly be a quarantinable disease. Suspicious signs and symptoms include:
a.
Temperature of 100°F (38°C) or greater, accompanied or followed by rash, jaundice, or lymphadenopathy, or which has persisted for two days or more.
b.
Diarrhea severe enough to interfere with work or normal activities.
2.
Persons who have traveled on a conveyance with, or have otherwise been in close contact with, a person diagnosed or suspected of having a quarantinable disease.
3.
Persons who arrive on a conveyance on which there are two or more unrelated persons with the same disease symptoms.
4.
Persons arriving from a smallpox-infected country who do not have a valid international smallpox vaccination certification.
When an ill person is denied immediate quarantine clearance upon arrival, a United States Public Health Service consultant physician will be called to examine, diagnose and clear the traveler. If diagnostic tests or further observation are required, a SURVEILLANCE ORDER, HSM-13.17, will be issued allowing the person entry, subject to the condition that he remain under observation of the appropriate District Health Officer for a specified period of time. Similar surveillance orders may be issued to exposed contacts who are not ill. A copy of each SURVEILLANCE ORDER, HSM-13.17, is sent to the District Health Officer. Where urgency exists, the District Health Officer is informed by telephone or telegraph.
Since there is no inspection for travelers from Canada, Canadian ports of entry send a similar NOTICE OF SURVEILLANCE, QS24, on travelers under surveillance with ultimate destinations in the United States.
When such notices are received, the Chief, Public Health Investigation, should be immediately notified.
B.
General Procedures
Public Health Investigation immediately contacts the traveler, and obtains the following information:
1.
Address and telephone where the traveler can be contacted until surveillance order expires.
2.
Detailed itinerary for 21 days preceding interview, and for the duration of the surveillance order.
3.
History of fever, rash, jaundice, diarrhea, or glandular swelling within preceding 21 days.
4.
Any information released by quarantine station or examining physician regarding diagnosis or laboratory tests.
This information is telephoned immediately to the District Health Officer, and a specific surveillance plan developed. These arrangements are reported to the Chief, Acute Communicable Disease Control.
If the detailed itinerary shows that the traveler plans to leave Los Angeles County before the expiration of the surveillance period, the further itinerary is reported to the Chief, Public Health Investigation, who notifies the State Department of Health.
C.
Special Procedures
1.
Smallpox. Persons under surveillance orders because of illness suspicious of (or exposure to) smallpox are examined immediately by the District Health Officer and continue to be examined daily until surveillance is completed. If specimens were taken for diagnosis at the port of entry, no laboratory diagnosis is generally required. Telephone the Chief, Acute Communicable Disease Control immediately.
Persons under surveillance orders only because of lack of valid small pox immunization are contacted immediately by Public Health Investigation. The specific surveillance plan developed is individualized; if the traveler is completely healthy, telephone surveillance may be instituted on approval by the District Health Officer. If any illness develops, the traveler is examined immediately by the District Health officer, who telephones findings immediately to the Chief, Acute Communicable Disease Control.
2.
Plague. Persons under surveillance orders for plague are examined daily by the District Health Officer until surveillance order expires. If fever, cough or adenopathy develop during surveillance, telephone the Chief, Acute Communicable Disease Control, immediately.
3.
Cholera. Persons under surveillance for cholera are contacted daily by telephone by Public Health Investigation until surveillance order expires. If diarrhea is present, the District Health Officer examines the person and obtains a feces specimen (special media required). This specimen is immediately carried to the Public Health Laboratory by the Public Health Investigator; simultaneously the Chief, Acute Communicable Disease Control is notified by telephone.
4.
Yellow Fever. Persons under surveillance for yellow fever are contacted daily by telephone by the Public Health Investigator until the surveillance order expires. If fever, jaundice, rash, nosebleed, vomiting, or blood in stool are reported, the District Health Officer immediately examines the person and telephones findings to the Chief, Acute Communicable Disease Control.
SEC. 12 - SCHOOL EXCLUSION AND READMISSION
(References: Administrative Code, Title 5, Education, Article 7, Section 65; California Health and Safety Code, Division 4, Chapter 3, Section 3118)
A.
EXCLUSION: State law requires officials of the public, private and Sunday schools to exclude persons with communicable disease or contacts of a communicable disease which is subject to strict isolation or quarantine. The school may exclude any nonimmune contact of a communicable disease case for the full or last portion of the incubation period. The County of Los Angeles Department of Health Services procedures will not abrogate that right.
If the disease in question is tuberculosis or venereal disease, the decision as to communicability is the responsibility of the Chiefs, Tuberculosis Control or Venereal Disease Control.
In an urban area, the closing of schools has not been shown to be an effective means of controlling an outbreak of any communicable disease. This procedure is, therefore, not generally recommended.
The SCHOOL EXCLUSION, H-451, is sent only to the school principal or his representative. This District Public Health Registrar immediately telephones the notice of exclusion to the proper school authority and confirms by sending the H-451 when the following diseases occur: cholera, diphtheria; plague, smallpox; typhus (louse-borne).
B.
READMISSION: Upon release from strict isolation or quarantine, the SCHOOL READMISSION NOTICE, H-447, signed by the District Health Officer must be given to pupils or their parents or guardian.
Pupils or school employees with any other communicable disease may be readmitted by written notice, signed by the attending physician, school physician, nurse superintendent, principal or the District Health Officer.
Students with non-communicable forms of tuberculosis may be readmitted if recommended by the chest clinician. However readmission to the Los Angeles City Schools must be referred to the Unit for Control of Tuberculosis, 625-4003, for clearance.
SEC. 13 - SENSITIVE OCCUPATIONS: PROCEDURES AND DEFINITIONS
Persons with or in contact with communicable disease may be a threat to the community by virtue of their work duties. Reports of such cases or contacts in sensitive occupations are immediately telephoned to the Chief, Public Health Investigation. (See Sec. 2) If necessary, these persons will be removed from work.
A.
SENSITIVE OCCUPATIONS—DEFINITIONS. Persons employed in sensitive occupations may include commercial food and milk handlers, child care workers, those treating, caring or cooking for others, or persons whose duties appreciably increase the risk of disease transmission. Preschool and early elementary aged children may need to be considered as sensitive occupations, in some circumstances.
1.
FOOD HANDLERS—SPECIAL DEFINITIONS. A commercial food handler prepares, processes, serves or sells food commercially, unless such food is completely packaged before being handled and reaches the consumer with the wrapping intact. For example, a route man handling entirely wrapped bread is not a food handler. A bakery route salesman handling unwrapped bakery products from open trays is a food handler.
2.
MILK HANDLERS—SPECIAL DEFINITION. A milk handler processes or distributes milk or handles milk containers. Those whose only contact is with (1) double-capped milk bottles or (2) packaged milk products are not milk handlers.
B.
STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS. A case or contact in a sensitive occupation removed from work may apply for State disability insurance benefits by completing and submitting STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS, DE 2501. Consult Chief, Public Health Investigation, for assistance in completing form.
C.
LABORATORY SPECIMENS. Laboratory slips for specimens submitted for cases or contacts in sensitive occupations must be marked with a red "SO" (Sensitive Occupation) to alert the laboratory of the need for urgent report.
SEC. 14 - HOSPITALIZATION AT LOS ANGELES COUNTY—UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MEDICAL CENTER
When referring persons with communicable disease, other than tuberculosis or venereal disease, to Los Angeles County—University of Southern California Medical Center, a direct telephone call to the Communicable Disease Admitting Room (226-3703) is preferable. For routine referrals use REFERRAL SLIP, H-354. The District Health officer is responsible for the tentative diagnosis and follow up, when necessary.
In quarantinable disease cases, arrangements for transportation and hospitalization are made by the Chief, Acute Communicable Disease Control. The person transporting the patient is instructed to:
A.
Go directly to the Communicable Disease Unit, ambulance entrance, 1129 North State Street, Los Angeles, California, without contacting other persons enroute.
B.
Keep the patient in a vehicle until examined by hospital personnel.
In other communicable disease cases, the District Health Officer arranges for transportation and hospitalization directly with the Communicable Disease Admitting Room personnel.
SEC. 15 - QUARANTINE
(Reference: Sections 2514 and 2520, California Administrative Code)
A.
Any reportable communicable disease may be quarantined at the discretion of the District Health Officer. (Section 3110, Health and Safety Code.) Quarantine will be routinely employed only for the diseases or circumstances listed in this section. The District Health Officer determines which contacts require quarantine, specifies the place of quarantine and issues appropriate instructions.
There are several types of quarantine; each one includes specific diseases and measures to be followed.
B.
Violations: Violations of quarantine or of pass privileges must be reported immediately to the Chief, Public Health Investigation.
C.
Classifications:
1.
Complete quarantine
a.
The limitation of freedom of movement or confinement of persons or domestic animals exposed to a communicable disease, for a period of time not longer than the longest usual incubation period of the disease, in such a manner as to prevent effective contact with unexposed persons.

Asymptomatic carriers, such as salmonella or typhoid carriers, are not permitted in nursing homes unless prior written approval is obtained from the Chief, Acute Communicable Disease Control.
5.
Special isolation. This isolation confines a patient with communicable disease, including tuberculosis and venereal disease, to his home, a hospital, sanitarium, jail facility or other specified location. Cooperative patients may be on voluntary isolation (home and hospital). Others may need an ORDER OF ISOLATION, H-474.
SEC. 17 - QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION PLACARDS
Quarantine or isolation (see Sections 15 and 16) is not established until a placard is posted and/or written instructions given to the patient or contact. The courts only recognize quarantine by placard or written instruction. Oral notice is not legally recognized.
When a residence is quarantined, the District Health Officer or his representative attaches the placard(s) at the front or principal entrance. More than one placard may be posted.
Placards must contain the name of the disease or suspected disease, the name of the District Health Officer, signature of deputy posting, date of posting, address and telephone number of the district health center.
The employee who establishes a quarantine or isolation by placard or issues passes reports the details to the Chief of Acute Communicable Disease Control and Public Health Investigation.
All correspondence with other Health Departments, relative to violations of quarantine or legal orders of isolation, is handled by Chief, Public Health Investigation.
SEC. 18 - HOSPITAL VISITS BY QUARANTINED PERSONS
Upon approval by the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center medical staff (226-3703), quarantined persons may visit the patient in the hospital.

In emergencies, and when other means of patient transportation are not available, Public Health Investigation personnel are called to assist.
SEC. 19 - RELEASE FROM ISOLATION OR QUARANTINE
A.
When laboratory tests are required for release from isolation or quarantine of cases, contacts or carriers, exclusive of tuberculosis patients, the specimens must be submitted to a Public Health Laboratory approved by the State Department of Health. Within the geographic area of Los Angeles County, Public Health Laboratories approved by the State Department of Health are those of the County of Los Angeles Community Health Services, the City of Pasadena Health Department, and the City of Long Beach Health Department.
B.
A NOTICE OF RELEASE TO RETURN TO WORK, H-1066, is issued by the District Health Officer, his representative, or the Public Health Investigator.
C.
Release from an order of isolation is by written notice from the Chief, Public Health Investigation. For additional procedure, consult with Tuberculosis Control.
SEC. 20 - TERMINAL CLEANING, VERMIN CONTROL AND DELOUSING
A.
Terminal Cleaning. Quarantine is not lifted until terminal cleaning of the residence is completed to the satisfaction of the District Health Officer. The isolation area and fomites should be washed with soap and water or suitable disinfectant solution. (See chart at back of California State Department of Health Control of Communicable Diseases Manual.)
B.
Vermin Control. Where a quarantinable vector-borne disease is suspected or known, a licensed pest control operator should properly treat, spray, or fumigate the premises, as necessary. This would be done under the direction of appropriate personnel of Environmental Management.
C.
Delousing. When infestation is evident and personal treatment is involved, treat the patient as outlined in PART IV—PEDICULOSIS. All suspected infested clothing, bedding, and personal articles, should be thoroughly washed in hot water (140°F) or dry cleaned, whichever is appropriate. The interior of the premises suspected to be infested should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed. If needed, a licensed pest control operator should treat the interior and exterior premises under the direction of appropriate personnel of Environmental Management.

Any patient with a communicable disease listed as a Reportable Disease may remain in the facility providing Title 22 regulations are met for adequate isolation except those specifically listed in Sec. 22. In addition, patients who are asymptomatic carriers of salmonella, typhoid or shigella must not be discharged to skilled nursing or intermediate care facilities unless prior written approval has been obtained from the Chief, Acute Communicable Disease Control.
SEC. 24 - REGULATIONS REGARDING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES
Persons with a communicable disease shall not be admitted or cared for unless the following are met:
1.
Any patient diagnosed as having a reportable, communicable disease or being in a carrier state, who the attending physician determines is a potential danger to other patients or personnel, shall be accommodated in a room provided with a separate toilet, handwashing facility, soap dispenser and individual towels.
2.
The skilled nursing facility shall adopt and observe written procedures approved by the local health officer. Such procedures shall be posted at the nurses' station or other appropriate location. The procedures shall outline the technique to be used in the care of patients with a communicable disease, and shall include:
a.
Handwashing upon entering and leaving patient's room.
b.
Proper handling and disposal of infectious material.
c.
Procedures for medical and nursing personnel providing for proper techniques.
d.
Health education provided to the patient.
e.
Proper handling of dishes.
f.

SEC. 26 - INFECTION CONTROL POLICIES
The Infection Control Committee should establish the facility's isolation polices, based on guidelines, A through H, in Sec. 27, enforce their implementation and approve all procedures. Policies and procedures should be reviewed annually and revised as necessary.
An employee health program, outlining routine communications, should be developed by the committee. Immunizations available to all hospital personnel should include diphtheria-tetanus, measles, influenza, and rubella. All employees, especially women of child-bearing age, should be tested for rubella susceptibility, appropriately counseled, and offered rubella immunizations. Rubella susceptible individuals should not be employed in high risk areas unless immunized. High risk personnel, such as those working in the renal dialysis units, should be informed of the risk of hepatitis and related infections and health services should be available to them. Tuberculin non-reactors in a health care facility should be skin tested at least every 6 months and more often if in a high risk area. An x-ray should be obtained if the skin test is positive. Consideration for antituberculous treatment should be given to all reactors an definitely to convertors. If antituberculous treatment is refused, yearly check x-ray is advisable routinely and as necessary for respiratory symptoms.
Stool examinations are strongly recommended pre-employment for food handlers to rule out amoeba, salmonella, etc. Periodic examinations to detect asymptomatic carriers, in general, are unnecessary. Rather, employee education, stressing personal hygiene, and removal of the employee from work when ill with diarrhea, etc., should be strictly enforced. Personnel with cutaneous lesions or other overt infections should not be allowed to care for patients, especially those in nurseries, on the burn unit, or in areas where there are patients with decreased host resistance, nor should such personnel be allowed to prepare or serve food.

  Use of Tables I, II and III.
1.
Classify open surface tank operations by (a) hazard potential (letter designation A to C from Table 1 and (b) rate of gas, vapor or mist evolution (number designation 1 to 4 from Table II).
2.
(a)
Determine class of open surface tank operations by (1) the substance(s), which may be released into the atmosphere and (2) the nature of such substance(s). When more than one substance is involved, base the class of operation on the substance having the highest hazard potential.
(b)
Determine rate of gas, vapor or mist evolution (1 to 4 from Table II.)
Reference for "Rate of Gassing" is Table 5-5-2, Appendix Industrial Ventilation, American Conference of Governmental Hygienists, Ninth Edition, 1966.
3.
Design of local exhaust ventilation systems should conform to the most hazardous condition that might occur, i.e., an operation shall be classified according to the highest hazard potential (Table I) and highest rate of evolution (Table II) that might occur—use strictest criteria in each table for determining classification.

A1 Benzidine. Because of high incidence of bladder tumors in man, any exposure, including skin, is extremely hazardous.
A2 B-Naphthylamine. Because of the extremely high incidence of bladder tumors in workers handling this compound and the inability to control exposures, B-naphthlyamine has been prohibited by the State of Pennsylvania from manufacture, use and other activities that involve human contact.
A3 N-Nitrosodimethylamine. Because of extremely high toxicity and presumed carcinogenic potential of this compound, contact by any route should not be permitted.
A4 Polytetrafluoroethylene* decomposition products. Thermal decomposition of the fluorocarbon chain in air leads to the formation of oxidized products containing carbon, fluorine and oxygen. Because these products decompose in part by hydrolysis in alkaline solution, they can be quantitatively determined in air as fluoride to provide an index of exposure. No MAC is recommended pending determination of the toxicity of the products, but air concentrations should be minimal.
*Trade Names: Algoflon, Fluon, Halon, Teflon, Tetran.
A5 B-Propiolactone. Because of high acute toxicity and demonstrated skin tumor production in animals, contact by any route should be avoided.
A6 Gasoline. The composition of gasoline varies greatly and thus a single MAC for all types of gasoline is no longer applicable. In general, the aromatic hydrocarbon content will determine what MAC applies. Consequently the content of benzene, other aromatics and additives should be determined to arrive at the appropriate MAC.
