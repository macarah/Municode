FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES are geographical areas designated pursuant to California Public Resources Codes sections 4201 through 4204 and classified as Very High, High, or Moderate in State Responsibility Areas or as Local Agency Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones designated pursuant to California Government Code sections 51175 through 51189. See Los Angeles County Fire Code, Chapter 49. IGNITION-RESISTANT MATERIAL is any product which, when tested in accordance with ASTM E 84 for a period of 30 minutes, shall have a flame spread of not over 25 and show no evidence of progressive combustion. In addition, the flame front shall not progress more than 10½ feet (3200 mm) beyond the centerline of the burner at any time during the test.
Materials shall pass the accelerated weathering test and be identified as exterior type, in accordance with ASTM D 2898 and ASTM D 3201. All materials shall bear identification showing the fire performance rating thereof. That identification shall be issued by ICC-ES or a testing facility recognized by the State Fire Marshal or the Building Official having a service for inspection of materials at the factory.
The Building Official may use other definitions of ignition-resistant material that reflect wildfire exposure to building materials and/or their materials, performance in resisting ignition.
STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA means lands that are classified by the Board of Forestry pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 4125 where the financial responsibility of preventing and suppressing forest fires is primarily the responsibility of the state.
VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONE (VHFHSZ) is a geographical area designated by the Los Angeles County Fire Department and defined in Appendix M of the Los Angeles County Fire Code Title 32.
WILDFIRE is any uncontrolled fire spreading through vegetative fuels that threatens to destroy life, property, or resources as defined in Public Resources Code Sections 4103 and 4104.
