Chapter 2.200 - LOS ANGELES COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT COMPLIANCE PROGRAM
Sections:

2.200.010 - Findings and declarations.
The board of supervisors finds that compliance with court-ordered child, family, or spousal obligations is in the public interest and benefits all residents of the county of Los Angeles. Unpaid support obligations have required the county and its taxpayers to protect the public health and welfare by providing a large array of social, medical and other services for the benefit of children and families to whom these support obligations are owed and to bear the cost of maintaining one of the largest support enforcement systems in the United States.
Therefore, the board of supervisors establishes the goal of ensuring that individuals who benefit financially from the county through employment or contracts are in compliance with their court-ordered child, family, and spousal support obligations in order to mitigate the economic burden otherwise imposed upon the county and its taxpayers.
