The purpose of the Animal Facility Grade Card is to provide notice to the public of the grade earned by an animal facility at the time of the most recent inspection of the facility.

B.
The letter grade reflected in the Animal Facility Inspection Report is based on the facility's level of compliance with applicable state statutes and local ordinances and policies relating to the care of animals. The grade shall be issued on the animal facility's final score as follows:
1.
Grade of A: Final score of 90% and above;
2.
Grade of B: Final score of 80% to 89%;
3.
Grade of C: Final score of 70% to 79%. A final score of 70% is the minimum grade required to maintain a license in good standing. A score of less than 70% will result in recommendations by the department regarding licensing or legal action to be taken as set forth in Section 10.28.290
(Ord. 2004-0036 § 19, 2004.)
10.28.280 - Display of grading card—Violation.

1.
Posted in the front window of the facility within five feet of the front door;
2.
Posted in a display case mounted on the outside front wall of the facility within five feet of the front door; or
3.
Posted in a location as directed and determined in the discretion of the director to ensure proper notice to the general public and to patrons.
B.
In the event that an animal facility is operated in the same building or space as a separately licensed or permitted business, or in the event that an animal facility shares a common patron entrance with such a separately owned or permitted business, or in the event of both, the facility shall post the Animal Facility Grade Card(s) in the initial patron contact area, or in a location as determined in the discretion of the director.
C.
The Animal Facility Grade Card shall not be defaced, marred, camouflaged, hidden or removed. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, it shall be unlawful to operate an animal facility unless the Animal Facility Grade Card is displayed as required by this Section 10.28.280. A violation of this subsection C is a misdemeanor, and is punishable as a misdemeanor under Penal Code Section 19.
D.
The director may waive posting of the Animal Facility Grade Card when the animal facility consists of animals maintained solely as personal pets which are not used to breed, show, sell, adopt or to transfer ownership or custody of the animals by any other method.
(Ord. 2004-0036 § 20, 2004.)
