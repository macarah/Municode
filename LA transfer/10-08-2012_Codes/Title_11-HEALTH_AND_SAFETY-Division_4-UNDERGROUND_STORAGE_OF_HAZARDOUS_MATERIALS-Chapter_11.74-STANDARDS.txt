B.
All installation, construction, repair or modification, closure, and removal shall be to the satisfaction of the director. The owner shall furnish the director with certification that underground storage tanks, associated piping and monitoring systems were properly installed. The director shall have the discretion to request authorization as provided in Section 11.72.030 to impose reasonable additional or different requirements in order to better secure the purpose and general obligation of this division for protection of public health, safety and welfare and prevention of short or long term health hazards or environmental degradation.
(Ord. 97-0016 § 27, 1997: Ord. 83-0208 § 1 (part), 1983: Ord. 83-0206U § 1 (part), 1983.)
11.74.030 - New facilities.
A.
New Underground Storage Tanks. No person, firm or corporation shall construct or install any new underground storage tank or facility until a permit has been issued pursuant to this division. All new underground storage tanks must, at minimum, meet the design, construction and monitoring standards of Article 3 of Chapter 16 of Division 3 of Title 23 of the California Code of Regulations.
B.
Monitoring Capability. All new facilities intended for the underground storage of hazardous materials shall be designed and constructed with a monitoring system capable of detecting that the hazardous material stored in the primary containment has entered the secondary containment. Visual inspection of the primary containment is the preferred method; however, other means of monitoring may be required by the director. Where secondary containment may be subject to the intrusion of water, a means of monitoring for such water shall be provided. Whenever monitoring devices are provided, they shall, where applicable, be connected to attention-getting visual and/or audible alarms.
C.
Containment Requirements. Primary and secondary levels of containment shall be required for all new facilities intended for the underground storage of hazardous materials unless exempted by Chapter 6.7 of the California Health and Safety Code.
1.
All primary containment shall be product-tight.
2.
Secondary Containment.
a.
All secondary containment shall be constructed of materials of sufficient thickness, density, and composition so as not to be structurally weakened as a result of contact with the discharged hazardous materials and so as to be capable of containing hazardous materials discharged from a primary containment for a period of time equal to or longer than the maximum anticipated time sufficient to allow recovery of the discharged hazardous material.
b.
In the case of installation with one primary containment, the secondary containment shall be large enough to contain at least 100 percent of the volume of the primary containment.
c.
In the case of a facility with multiple primary containments, the secondary containment shall be large enough to contain 150 percent of the volume of the largest primary containment placed in it, or 10 percent of the aggregate internal volume of all primary containments in the facility, whichever is greater.
d.
If the facility is open to rainfall, then the secondary containment must be able to additionally accommodate the volume of a 24-hour rainfall as determined by a 100-year storm history.
3.
Laminated, coated, or clad materials shall be considered single-walled and shall not be construed to fulfill the requirements of both primary and secondary containment.
4.
The design and construction of underground storage tanks for motor vehicle fuels storage need not meet the requirements of Section 11.74.030 C1—C3 of this division if all of the conditions of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 25291 of Chapter 6.7 of the California Health and Safety Code are met.
D.
Spill and Overfill Protection. Means of spill and overfill protection shall be required for any primary containment. This may be an overfill prevention device and/or an attention-getting high level alarm.
E.
Separation of Materials. Materials that in combination may cause fire or explosion, or the production of a flammable, toxic, or poisonous gas, or the deterioration of a primary or secondary containment shall be separated in both the primary and secondary containment so as to avoid intermixing.
F.
Drainage System. Drainage of precipitation from within a storage facility containing hazardous materials shall be controlled in a manner approved by the director so as to prevent hazardous materials from being discharged. No drainage system will be approved unless the flow of the drain can be controlled. Disposal of drainage shall comply with the requirements of Title 20, Division 2 of this code.
(Ord. 97-0016 § 28, 1997: Ord. 83-0208 § 1 (part), 1983: Ord. 83-0206U § 1 (part), 1983.)
11.74.040 - Existing facilities.
Any facility in existence as of January 1, 1984, which does not meet the standards of Section 11.74.030, may be issued a provisional permit pursuant to this division as long as it is providing suitable underground storage for hazardous materials. In addition, such facility must be monitored in accordance with a plan approved by the director as set forth in this section. Such facility shall have 30 days from the date of notification by the director or by the date established by California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 6.7, whichever occurs first, to file a complete application for a permit including a monitoring plan.
A.
A monitoring plan for each such facility shall be submitted to the director as part of the permit application.
B.
Monitoring under such plan shall include visual inspection of the primary containment wherever practical; however, if the visual inspection is not practical, an alternative method of monitoring each facility on a semiannual or more frequent basis may be approved by the director.
C.
Alternative method(s) of monitoring may include but are not limited to: pressure testing of piping systems, groundwater monitoring well(s) where appropriate; and analysis of the soil boring(s) at the time of initial installation of the well(s). The number of well(s), depth of well(s), and sampling frequency shall be approved by the director. All monitoring methods must meet the design standards of Article 4 of Chapter 16 of Division 3 of Title 23 of California Code of Regulations.
