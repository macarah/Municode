Any such tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the County by the person required to collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person owing money to the County under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable in an action brought in the name of the County for the recovery of such amount, including penalties and interest as provided for in this chapter, along with any collection costs incurred by the County as a result of the person(s noncompliance with this chapter, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees. Any tax required to be collected by a service supplier or owed by a service user is an unsecured priority excise tax obligation under 11 U.S.C.A. Section 507(a)(8)(C).
(Ord. 2008-0072 § 1 (part), 2008.)
4.62.150 - Deficiency determination and assessment—Tax application errors.
A.
The Tax Administrator shall make a deficiency determination if he or she determines that any service supplier or service user required to pay, collect, and/or remit taxes pursuant to the provisions of this chapter has failed to pay, collect, and/or remit the proper amount of tax by improperly or failing to apply the tax to one or more taxable services or charges. Nothing herein shall require that the Tax Administrator institute proceedings under this section 4.62.150 if, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs the tax benefit.
B.
The Tax Administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency determination to the person or entity allegedly owing the tax, which notice shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, the collection penalties imposed pursuant to section 4.62.130, plus interest at the rate of one and one-half (1.5%) percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the date on which the tax should have been received by the County. Within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of service of such notice, the person or entity allegedly owing the tax may request in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the matter.
C.
If the person or entity allegedly owing the tax fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time period, the amount of the deficiency determination shall become a final assessment, and shall immediately be due and owing to the County. If the person requests a hearing, the Tax Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing, which shall be scheduled within thirty (30) days after receipt of the written request for hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed by the Tax Administrator to such person or entity at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing, and, if the Tax Administrator desires said person or entity to produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records requested to be produced.
D.
At the time fixed for the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall hear all relevant testimony and evidence, including that of any other interested parties. At the discretion of the Tax Administrator, the hearing may be continued from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall issue a final assessment (or non-assessment), thereafter, by confirming, modifying or rejecting the original deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final assessment to person or entity owing the tax. The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed pursuant to section 4.62.200 of this chapter.
E.
Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of receipt of the notice of final assessment. As provided in section 4.62.130, the penalty for delinquency shall be fifteen percent (15%) on the total amount of the assessment, along with interest at the rate of one and one-half (1.5%) percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date of delinquency, until paid. The applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by the County seeking payment of a tax assessed under this chapter shall commence from the date of delinquency as provided in this subsection (E).
F.
All notices under this section may be sent by regular mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third calendar day following the date of mailing, as established by a proof of mailing.
(Ord. 2008-0072 § 1 (part), 2008.)
4.62.160 - Administrative remedy—Non-paying service users.
A.
Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the amounts the service user remits to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the Tax Administrator deems it in the best interest of the County, he or she may relieve such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this chapter from certain named service users for specified billing periods. To the extent the service user has failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two (2) or more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation to collect taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the County with the names and addresses of such service users, the amounts of taxes owed, and the associated billing periods, under the provisions of this chapter. Nothing herein shall require that the Tax Administrator institute proceedings under this section if, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs the tax benefit.
B.
In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency penalty at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the total tax that is owed, and shall pay interest at the rate of one and one-half (1.5%) percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the due date, until paid.
C.
The Tax Administrator shall notify the non-paying service user that the Tax Administrator has assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, including penalties and interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have a change of address, to his or her last known address.
D.
If the service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or her, the Tax Administrator may impose an additional penalty of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the total tax that is owed, along with the interest at the rate of one and one-half (1.5%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the date on which the tax should have been received by the County.

A.
The Tax Administrator shall have the power and duty, to enforce each and all of the provisions of this chapter.
B.
The Tax Administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations consistent with provisions of this chapter for the purpose of interpreting, clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes herein imposed. A copy of such administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office. To the extent that the Tax Administrator determines that the tax imposed under this chapter shall not be collected in full for any period of time from any particular service supplier or service user, that determination shall be considered an exercise of the Tax Administrator's discretion to settle disputes and shall not constitute a change in taxing methodology for purposes of Government Code Section 53750, nor is such determination a waiver of the County's ability to impose the tax in full. The Tax Administrator is not authorized to amend the taxing methodology for purposes of Government Code Section 53750.
C.
Upon a proper showing of good cause, the Tax Administrator may make administrative agreements, with appropriate conditions, to vary from the strict requirements of this chapter and thereby (1) conform to the billing procedures of a particular service supplier so long as said agreements result in the collection of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this chapter; or (2) to avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office and are voidable by the Tax Administrator or the County at any time.
D.
The Tax Administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper compliance with the requirements of this chapter, of any person required to collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this chapter. The Tax Administrator shall notify said person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the absence of fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit period of review shall not exceed a period of three (3) years next preceding the date of receipt of the written notice by said person from the Tax Administrator. Upon completion of the audit, the Tax Administrator may make a deficiency determination pursuant to section 4.62.150 of this chapter for all taxes (and applicable penalties and interest) owed and not paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the Tax Administrator. If said person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient records to enable the Tax Administrator to verify compliance with this chapter, the Tax Administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate of the deficiency. Said reasonable estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of correctness.
E.
Upon receipt of a written request of a service supplier, and for good cause, the Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing any statement required pursuant to this chapter for a period of not to exceed forty-five (45) days, provided that the time for filing the required statement has not already passed when the request is received. No penalty for delinquent payment shall accrue by reason of such extension. Interest shall accrue during said extension at the rate of one and one-half (1.5%) percent per month, prorated for any portion thereof.
F.
The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person who asserts a right to exemption from, or a refund of, the tax imposed by this chapter.
G.
Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, the Tax Administrator may waive any penalty or interest imposed upon a person required to collect and/or remit for failure to collect the tax imposed by this chapter if the non-collection occurred in good faith. In determining whether the non-collection was in good faith, the Tax Administrator shall take into consideration industry practice or other precedence.
(Ord. 2008-0072 § 1 (part), 2008.)
4.62.180 - Records.
A.
It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and remit to the County any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of at least three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and remittance to the Tax Administrator, which records Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.
B.
The County, through the Board of Supervisors, may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to deliver, to the Tax Administrator, copies of all records deemed necessary by the Tax Administrator to establish compliance with this chapter, including the delivery of records in a common electronic format on readily available media if such records are kept electronically by the person in the usual and ordinary course of business. As an alternative to delivering the subpoenaed records to the Tax Administrator on or before the due date provided in the administrative subpoena, such person may provide access to such records outside the County on or before the due date, provided that such person shall reimburse the County for all reasonable travel expenses incurred by the County to inspect those records, including travel, lodging, meals, and other similar expenses, but excluding the normal salary or hourly wages of those persons designated by the County to conduct the inspection.
C.
The Tax Administrator is authorized to execute a non-disclosure agreement approved by the County Counsel to protect the confidentiality of customer information pursuant to Revenue and Tax Code sections 7284.6 and 7284.7.
D.
If a service supplier uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax, the service supplier shall: (1) provide to the Tax Administrator the name, address and telephone number of each billing agent and billing aggregator currently authorized by the service supplier to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax to the County; and, (2) upon request of the Tax Administrator, deliver, or effect the delivery of, any information or records in the possession of such billing agent or billing aggregator that, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, is necessary to verify the proper application, calculation, collection and/or remittance of such tax to the County.
E.
If any person subject to record-keeping under this section unreasonably denies the Tax Administrator access to such records, or fails to produce the information requested in an administrative subpoena within the time specified, then the Tax Administrator may impose a penalty of $500 on such person for each day following: 1) the initial date that the person refuses to provide such access; or, 2) the due date for production of records as set forth in the administrative subpoena. This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed under this chapter.
(Ord. 2008-0072 § 1 (part), 2008.)
4.62.190 - Refund claims.
A.
Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax Administrator under this chapter from a service user or service supplier, it may be refunded as provided in this section. However, if the appeals procedure set forth in section 4.62.200 is applicable, that procedure must first be exhausted before a refund may be had under this section.
B.
The Tax Administrator may refund any tax that has been overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax Administrator under this chapter from a service user or service supplier, provided that no refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant or his or her guardian, executor, or administrator has submitted a written claim to the Tax Administrator within one year of the overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of said tax. Such claim must clearly establish claimant's right to the refund by written records showing entitled thereto. Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers unless each member of the class has submitted a written claim under penalty of perjury as provided in this subsection.
C.
The Tax Administrator, where the claim is less than the settlement authority established in title 2.14.020 of the County Code, or the Board of Supervisors where the claim is in excess of that amount, shall act upon the refund claim within forty-five (45) days of the initial receipt of the refund claim. Said decision shall be final. If the Tax Administrator/Board of Supervisors fails or refuses to act on a refund claim within the forty-five (45) day period, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected by the Tax Administrator/Board of Supervisors on the forty-fifth (45th) day. The Tax Administrator shall give notice of the action in a form which substantially complies with that set forth in Government Code Section 913.
D.
The filing of a written claim pursuant to Government Code Section 935 is a prerequisite to any suit thereon. Any action brought against the County pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions of Government Code Sections 945.6 and 946.
E.
Notwithstanding the notice provisions of subsection (A) of this section, the Tax Administrator may, at his or her discretion, give written permission to a service supplier, who has collected and remitted any amount of tax in excess of the amount of tax imposed by this chapter, to claim credit for such overpayment against the amount of tax which is due the County upon a subsequent monthly return(s) to the Tax Administrator, provided that: i) such credit is claimed in a return dated no later than one year from the date of overpayment or erroneous collection of said tax; ii) the Tax Administrator is satisfied that the underlying basis and amount of such credit has been reasonably established; and, iii) in the case of an overpayment by a service user to the service supplier that has been remitted to the County, the Tax Administrator has received proof, to his or her satisfaction, that the overpayment has been refunded by the service supplier to the service user in an amount equal to the requested credit.
F.
Notwithstanding subsections (A) though (D) above, a service supplier shall be entitled to take any overpayment as a credit against an underpayment whenever such overpayment has been received by the County within the three (3) years next preceding a deficiency determination or assessment by the Tax Administrator in connection with an audit instituted by the Tax Administrator pursuant to section 4.62.170. A service supplier shall not be entitled to said credit unless it first clearly establishes to the Tax Administrator the right to the credit by written records showing entitlement thereto. Under no circumstances shall an overpayment taken as a credit against an underpayment pursuant to this subsection qualify a service supplier for a refund to which it would not otherwise be entitled under the one-year written claim requirement of this section.
(Ord. 2008-0072 § 1 (part), 2008.)

4.62.210 - Severability.
If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter or any part thereof is for any reason held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining portion of this chapter or any part thereof shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect. The Board of Supervisors of the County of Los Angeles hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared invalid.
(Ord. 2008-0072 § 1 (part), 2008.)
4.62.220 - Notice of changes to ordinance.
If a tax under this chapter is added, repealed, increased, reduced, or the tax base is changed, the Tax Administrator shall follow the notice requirements of Public Utilities Code Section 799.
(Ord. 2008-0072 § 1 (part), 2008.)
4.62.230 - Effect of state and federal reference/authorization.
A.
Unless specifically provided otherwise, any reference to a state or federal statute in this chapter means such statute as it may be amended from time to time, provided that such reference to a statute shall not include any subsequent amendment thereto, or to any subsequent change of interpretation thereto by a state or federal agency or court of law with the duty to interpret such law, to the extent that such amendment or change of interpretation would require voter approval under California law, or to the extent that such change would result in a tax decrease, as a result of excluding all or a part of a utility service, or charge therefor, from taxation. Only to the extent that voter approval would otherwise be required or a tax decrease would result, the prior version of the statute or its interpretation, shall remain applicable, for any application or situation that would not require voter approval or result in a decrease of a tax, provisions of the amended statute or new interpretation thereof shall be applicable to the maximum possible extent.
B.
To the extent that the County's authorization to collect or impose any tax under this chapter is expanded or limited as a result of changes in state or federal law, no amendment or modification of this chapter shall be required to conform the tax to those changes, and the tax shall be imposed and collected to the full extent of the authorization up to the full amount of the tax imposed under this chapter.
(Ord. 2008-0072 § 1 (part), 2008.)
4.62.240 - Independent audit of tax collection, exemption, remittance, and expenditure.
The County shall annually verify that the taxes owed under this chapter have been properly applied, exempted, collected, and remitted in accordance with this chapter, and properly expended according to applicable municipal law.

The verification shall not be required of tax remitters where the cost of the verification may exceed the tax revenues to be reviewed.
(Ord. 2008-0072 § 1 (part), 2008.)
4.62.250 - Remedies cumulative.
All remedies and penalties prescribed by this chapter or which are available under any other provision of law or equity, including but not limited to the California False Claims Act (Government Code Section 12650 et seq.) and the California Unfair Practices Act (Business and Professions Code Section 17070 et seq.), are cumulative. The use of one or more remedies by the County shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2008-0072 § 1 (part), 2008.)
4.62.260 - Interaction with prior tax.
A.
Collection of Tax by Service Providers. Service providers shall begin to collect the tax imposed by this amended Chapter 4.62 as soon as feasible after the effective date of the chapter, but in no event later than permitted by Section 799 of the Public Utilities Code.
B.
Satisfaction of Tax Obligation by Service Users. Prior to April 1, 2009, any person who pays the tax levied pursuant to Chapter 4.62 of this Code, as it existed prior to its amendment as provided herein, with respect to any charge for a service shall be deemed to have satisfied his or her obligation to pay the tax levied pursuant to chapter 4.62 as amended herein, with respect to that charge. The intent of this paragraph is to prevent the imposition of multiple taxes upon a single utility charge during the transition period from the prior Utility User Tax ordinance to the amended Utility User Tax ordinance (which transition period ends April 1, 2009) and to permit service providers or other persons with an obligation to remit the tax hereunder, during that transition period, to satisfy their collection obligations by collecting either tax.
C.
In the event that a final court order should determine that the election enacting this Chapter 4.62 (as amended herein) is invalid for whatever reason, or that any tax imposed under this Chapter 4.62 (as amended herein) is invalid in whole or in part, then the taxes imposed under Chapter 4.62 of this Code, as it existed prior to its amendment as provided herein, shall automatically continue to apply with respect to any service for which the tax levied pursuant to this chapter has been determined to be invalid. Such automatic continuation shall be effective beginning as of the first date of service (or billing date) for which the tax imposed by this chapter is not valid. However, in the event of an invalidation, any tax (other than a tax that is ordered refunded by the court or is otherwise refunded by the County) paid by a person with respect to a service and calculated pursuant to this Chapter 4.62 (as amended herein) shall be deemed to satisfy the tax imposed under Chapter 4.62, as it existed prior to its amendment as provided herein, on that service, so long as the tax is paid with respect to a service provided no later than six months subsequent to the date on which the final court order is published.
(Ord. 2008-0072 § 1 (part), 2008.)
