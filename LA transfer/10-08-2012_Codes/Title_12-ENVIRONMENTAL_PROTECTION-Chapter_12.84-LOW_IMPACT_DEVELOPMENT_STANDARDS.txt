Chapter 12.84 - LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
Sections:

12.84.410 - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is:
A.
To require the use of low impact development ("LID") standards in developments. LID encourages site sustainability and smart growth in a manner that respects and preserves the characteristics of the County's watersheds, drainage paths, water supplies, and natural resources. LID builds on conventional design strategies by utilizing every softscape and hardscape surface in a development to perform a beneficial hydrologic function by retaining, detaining, storing, changing the timing of, or filtering stormwater and urban runoff. LID encompasses the use of structural devices, engineered systems, vegetated natural designs, and education in order to distribute stormwater and urban runoff across a development site. LID reduces the impact from the development and provides the benefits of:
1.
Replenishing groundwater supplies;
2.
Improving the quality of surface water runoff;
3.
Stabilizing natural stream characteristics;
4.
Preserving natural site characteristics; and
5.
Minimizing downstream impacts.
B.
The provisions in this Chapter 12.84 shall be construed to augment any county, state, or federal ordinance, statute, regulation, or other requirement governing the same or related matter, and where a conflict exists between a provision in this Chapter 12.84 and such other ordinance, statute, regulation, or requirement, the stricter provision shall apply to the extent permitted by law.

12.84.430 - Applicability.
A.
This chapter shall become effective on January 1, 2009, and shall apply to all development within the unincorporated areas of the County after that date except for the following:
1.
Any development where a complete discretionary or non-discretionary permit application was filed with the Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning, Public Works, or any County-controlled design control board, prior to January 1, 2009;
2.
Any development involving emergency construction activities required to immediately protect public health and safety; or
3.
Public road and flood control infrastructure developments, which shall be subject to Public Works' design standards that incorporate LID principles.
B.
Unless excluded by subsection A above, any development that alters an existing impervious surface area shall comply with this Chapter 12.84 as follows:
1.
Where the development results in an alteration of at least fifty (50) percent of the impervious surfaces of an existing developed site, the entire site shall be brought into compliance with the standards and requirements of this Chapter; and
2.
Where the development results in an alteration of less than fifty (50) percent of the impervious surfaces of an existing developed site, only such incremental development shall meet the standards and requirements of this Chapter; and
3.
Where a development results in an alteration of less than fifty (50) percent of the impervious surfaces of an existing developed site consisting of four (4) or fewer residential units, the development shall be exempt from this Chapter.
(Ord. No. 2008-0063 ยง 1 (part), 2008.)
12.84.440 - Low Impact Development Standards.
A.
The LID standards of this Chapter are:
1.
Mimic undeveloped stormwater and urban runoff rates and volumes in any storm event up to and including the "50-year capital design storm event," as defined by Public Works;
2.
Prevent pollutants of concern from leaving the development site in stormwater as the result of storms, up to and including a water quality design storm event; and

A.
Site plan review.
1.
The County Department of Regional Planning shall conduct a site plan review in accordance with Title 22 of the Los Angeles County Code to determine compliance with this Chapter 12.84. The site plan submitted for the development shall clearly depict any and all LID standards that will be incorporated into the development. Regional Planning shall approve compliance with these standards in concept only, subject to the setback and development standards in Title 22. Final approval of such compliance shall be made by Public Works in conjunction with its review and approval of the LID plan described in subsection B.
2.
The same site plan shall be used to show compliance with this Chapter 12.84, the green building requirements of Part 20, Chapter 22.52, and the drought-tolerant landscaping requirements of Part 21, Chapter 22.52, to the extent these other requirements apply to the development.
3.
In any case where a site plan for a development has been or will be concurrently filed with an application for a permit, variance, zone change, development agreement, or other discretionary approval under Title 22, or with an application for a subdivision under Title 21, the site plan procedure set forth in this Section 12.84.450 shall not apply and instead, the Exhibit "A," tentative map, or other site plan required for such other approval shall be used to show compliance with this Chapter 12.84
B.
LID plan review.
In addition to the site plan required by subsection A of this Section, the applicant shall also submit a LID plan to the Director for review and approval that provides a comprehensive, technical discussion of how the development will comply with this Chapter 12.84 and the LID Standards Manual. A deposit and fee to recover the costs associated with LID plan review shall be required. The time for obtaining LID plan approval shall be as follows:
1.
For subdivisions, the LID plan shall be approved prior to the tentative map approval;
2.
For any development requiring a conditional use permit ("CUP") or other entitlement required under Title 22 of the Los Angeles County Code, the LID plan shall be approved prior to the issuance of any such CUP or other entitlement; and
3.
For all other development, the LID plan shall be approved prior to issuance of a grading permit for such development, and when no grading permit is required, prior to the issuance of a building permit for such development.
(Ord. No. 2008-0063 ยง 1 (part), 2008.)
