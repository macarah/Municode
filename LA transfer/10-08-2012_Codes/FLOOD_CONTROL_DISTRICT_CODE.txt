4.
If upon completion of the District's work, the actual cost is greater than the amount deposited, the applicant, upon demand of the chief engineer of the District, shall pay to the District an amount equal to the deficiency. If the applicant fails or refuses to pay such deficiency upon demand, the District may recover the same by appropriate legal action. Until such deficiency is paid in full, the District's approvals, reports or miscellaneous service cannot be considered as complete and final.
H.
The fees and charges set forth in this section shall not be applicable in the event fees and charges are set out in a formal instrument in writing referring to the particular improvement, report or service, executed or approved by the board of supervisors of the District. Fees may also be expressly waived if the particular improvement, report or service is in the interest of the District as determined by District's chief engineer.

J.
The fees set forth in subsections A through F of this Section shall be reviewed annually by the District's chief engineer. Beginning on July 1, 2011, and thereafter on each succeeding July 1st, the amount of each fee shall be adjusted as follows: Calculate the percentage movement between March of the previous year and March of the current year in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers in the Los Angeles, Anaheim, and Riverside areas, as published by the United States Government Bureau of Labor Statistics, adjust each fee by said percentage amount and round up to the nearest dollar. No adjustment shall increase or decrease any fee to an amount more or less than the amount necessary to recover the reasonable cost of providing the services for which the fee is imposed. When it is determined that the amount reasonably necessary to recover the cost of providing the services for which the fees are imposed is in excess of this adjustment, the District's chief engineer may present fee proposals to the Board of Supervisors for approval.
K.
If the District's chief engineer determines that, due to the complexity of the work proposed by the applicant or other unusual circumstances, any fee specified in this Chapter will be insufficient to recover the District's reasonable costs of providing the corresponding services, the District may require a deposit in lieu of the fee, from which the actual costs of services will be deducted.

The amount of the investigation fee shall be equal to the total amount of all other fees applicable to the connection, alteration, modification or use, authorized by this Chapter. The District's chief engineer, or his/her designee, may waive the investigation fee if the District's chief engineer or his/her designee determines that the connection, alteration, modification or use was urgently necessary and that it was not practical to obtain a permit before the commencement of the work. In all such emergency cases, a permit shall be obtained as soon as it is practical to do so, and if there is an unreasonable delay in obtaining the permit, an investigation fee shall be charged as provided in this subparagraph. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as authorizing any person, firm, corporation, municipality, or district to begin work without the required permit except in case of an emergency.
M.
The fees set forth in subsections B, D, F1 through F7, and F10, of this Section shall be subject to a twenty percent (20%) reduction if charged for services rendered by the District in connection with a project involving one single-family residence or one structure with a building footprint of 10,000 square feet or less.
