Chapter 2.190 - POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS FOR COUNTY OFFICES
Sections:

2.190.010 - Findings.
The people of the county of Los Angeles find that as the cost of campaigning for county office increases, there is the need to raise larger and larger amounts of money, much of which may come from interest groups with a stake in matters pending before county officers. While citizens of the county should be allowed to make financial contributions to political campaigns for county offices as a legitimate form of participation in the political process, there is a need to reduce the opportunity for persons or organizations to use their financial strength to attempt to exercise control over candidates and the electoral process.
(Ord. 96-0041 § 1 (part), 1996.)
2.190.020 - Purpose and declaration of intent.
The purpose of the ordinance codified in this chapter is to reduce the opportunity for corruption of the political process by establishing rules for the conduct of political campaigns for county offices. In recognition that the courts have limited the ability of the government to place mandatory ceilings on either overall campaign expenditures or the expenditure by a candidate of his or her personal funds, it is the intent of the ordinance codified in this chapter to establish voluntary limits on such expenditures. This chapter also establishes mandatory limits on the amount any one person can contribute to a campaign, the level of which varies based upon the extent to which the candidates for a particular office have agreed to be bound by the voluntary expenditure limits. It is not the intent of the ordinance codified in this chapter that it have any impact, or place any limits, on recall election campaigns.

Should the candidate choose not to challenge the fine, the registrar-recorder may, at his discretion, determine the amount of the fine without a hearing and without a recommendation from a hearing officer. Whether or not a violation is inadvertent, negligent or deliberate, and the presence or absence of good faith shall be considered by the registrar-recorder in determining the amount of the administrative fine to be imposed.

In addition, the registrar-recorder shall provide notification of the final resolution of each violation to the district attorney.
F.
The district attorney shall be the enforcement officer responsible for prosecution of the civil penalties and criminal charges.
