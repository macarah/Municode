(Ord. 2007-0108 § 33 (part), 2007.)
J110.3 - Planting.
The surface of all cut slopes more than 5 feet (1524 mm) in height and fill slopes more than 3 feet (915 mm) in height shall be protected against damage from erosion by planting with grass or ground cover plants. Slopes exceeding 15 feet (4572 mm) in vertical height shall also be planted with shrubs, spaced at not to exceed 10 feet (3048 mm) on centers, or trees, spaced at not to exceed 20 feet (6096 mm) on centers; or a combination of shrubs and trees at an equivalent spacing, in addition to the grass or ground cover plants. The plants selected and planting methods used shall be suitable for the soil and climatic conditions of the site.
Plant material shall be selected which will produce a coverage of permanent planting to effectively control erosion. Consideration shall be given to deep-rooted plant material needing limited watering, maintenance, high root to shoot ratio, wind susceptibility, and fire-retardant characteristics. All plant materials must be approved by the Building Official.
Planting may be modified for the site if specific recommendations are provided by both the Geotechnical Engineer and a Landscape Architect. Specific recommendations must consider soils and climatic conditions, irrigation requirements, planting methods, fire-retardant characteristics, water efficiency, maintenance needs, and other regulatory requirements. Recommendations must include a finding that the alternative planting will provide a permanent and effective method of erosion control. Modifications to planting must be approved by the Building Official prior to installation.
