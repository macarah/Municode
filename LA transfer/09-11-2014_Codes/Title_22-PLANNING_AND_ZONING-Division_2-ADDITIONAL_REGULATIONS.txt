The board of supervisors shall not overrule a majority protest unless it finds that the public health, safety or general welfare require that provision be made for the installation of the proposed public facilities project(s). In the event a majority protest is not withdrawn or overruled, the board of supervisors shall not, for one year from the filing of that written protest, commence or carry on any proceedings for the same public facilities project under the provisions of this chapter. If any majority protest which is not withdrawn or overruled is directed against only a portion of the public facilities project, then all further proceedings under the provisions of this chapter to construct that portion of the public facilities project so protested against shall be barred for a period of one year; but the board of supervisors shall not be barred from commencing new proceedings, not including any part of the public facilities project so protested against. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the board of supervisors within a one-year period, from commencing and carrying on new proceedings for the construction of a portion of the public facilities project so protested against if it finds, by the affirmative vote of four-fifths of its members, that the owners of more than one-half of the area of the property to be benefited are in favor of going forward with such portion of the public facilities project.
(Ord. 86-0024 § 1 (part), 1986.)
22.68.090 - Resolution of designation.

A.
After the adoption by the board of supervisors of a resolution of designation, the director of public works shall prepare a diagram of the boundaries of the area of benefit based on said resolution and shall file same with the board of supervisors. The director of public works shall also file a copy of the diagram referred to in this subsection in the office of the county recorder.
B.
After recording the assessment and diagram, the director of public works shall execute and record a notice of assessment in the office of the county recorder.
C.
From the date of the recording of the notice of assessment in accordance with the provisions of subsection B of this section, all persons shall be deemed to have notice of the contents of such assessment. Immediately upon such recording in the office of the county recorder each of the assessments shall be a lien upon the property against which it is made.
D.
In its discretion, and for good cause shown, the board of supervisors may, upon terms and conditions prescribed by the board of supervisors in its resolution of designation or thereafter, allow the lien of the facilities benefit assessment to become subordinate to the lien of deed(s) of trust executed by landowners to secure loans to finance the construction of improvements on the property within the area of benefit.
E.
The director of public works shall file a copy of the diagram and notice of assessment referred to in this section with the office of assessor.
(Ord. 86-0024 § 1 (part), 1986.)
22.68.110 - Payment of benefit assessments.
After the adoption by the board of supervisors of its resolution of designation, no building permits shall be issued for development on any land included within the area of benefit unless and until the facilities benefit assessments established by the resolution of designation for such lands have been paid. The facilities benefit assessment shall be paid by the landowner upon the issuance of building permit(s) for development or at such time as the capital improvement program for the area of benefit in which the assessed land is located calls for the commencement of construction of the public facilities project. In the event that a landowner desires to proceed with development of a portion of the landowner's property, based on a phased development program, which is subject to a lien for the total amount of facilities benefit assessments as provided in this chapter, the landowner may obtain building permits for the development phase after paying a portion of the facilities benefit assessments and making provision for payment of the remainder of the facilities benefit assessments to the satisfaction of the director of public works. Money received by the county as payment of the facilities benefit assessments shall be deposited in a special fund established for the area of benefit and shall therefore be expended solely for the purposes for which it was assessed and levied. Upon payment of the facilities benefit assessment as provided in this chapter, the lien which attaches pursuant to Section 22.68.100 shall be discharged. In the event the partial payment is made based on a phased construction program, the county shall release the portion of the property for which building permits have been issued from the lien of the facilities benefit assessment.
(Ord. 86-0024 § 1 (part), 1986.)
22.68.120 - Recordation of notice of pendency of sale or foreclosure.
Where there is a delinquency in payment of the facilities benefit assessments as required by Section 22.68.110, the county may initiate foreclosure proceedings in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section and in any and all applicable state and local laws. If a sale or foreclosure is commenced, notice of the pendency of such sale or foreclosure shall be recorded with the county recorder not later than 10 days after commencing an action or proceeding in any court to foreclose the lien of such assessment. The notice of pendency shall state that the county of Los Angeles has commenced a sale or foreclosure, as the case may be, and shall refer to and identify such sale or foreclosure and shall describe the property affected thereby. The county shall be entitled to recover the cost of recordation of any such notice of pendency in any sale or foreclosure resulting from such delinquency, and provision therefor shall be made in any notice, order or judgment authorizing or providing for such sale or foreclosure.
(Ord. 86-0024 § 1 (part), 1986.)
22.68.130 - Annual adjustment of facilities benefit assessment.
The board of supervisors may, annually after the adoption of the resolution of designation and subject to the requirements set forth in Sections 22.68.040 through 22.68.100, cause an adjustment to be made in the facilities benefit assessments established by the resolution. The adjustments may reflect increases or decreases in the actual cost of the public facilities project or if the public facilities project has not yet been constructed then the estimated cost of the proposed capital improvements as reflected in changes in the scope of the public facilities project or any other indices as the board of supervisors may deem appropriate for this purpose. The modifications may also reflect changes in the improvements proposed to be constructed as well as the availability, or lack thereof of other funds with which to construct the capital improvements.
(Ord. 86-0024 § 1 (part), 1986.)
22.68.140 - Consideration in lieu of assessment.
A.
The provisions of Section 22.80.100 to the contrary notwithstanding, upon application by the landowner or his authorized agent, the board of supervisors may accept consideration in lieu of the facilities benefit assessments required pursuant to this chapter, provided the board of supervisors, upon recommendation of the director of public works, finds that the substitute consideration proposed:
1.
Has a value equal to or greater than such facilities benefit assessments;
2.
Is in a form acceptable to the board of supervisors; and
3.
Is within the scope of the public facilities project.
B.
The board of supervisors may accept consideration in lieu of the facilities benefit assessments required pursuant to this chapter where the board of supervisors finds that the substitute consideration proposed is less than the value of such facilities benefit assessment after payment of an amount equal to the difference between the value of the substitute consideration as determined by the board of supervisors and the amount of such facilities benefit assessments.
(Ord. 86-0024 § 1 (part), 1986.)
22.68.150 - Termination of area of benefit.
Upon the receipt of an application by a landowner or his designated agent, or on its own motion, the board of supervisors may initiate proceedings for the termination of an area of benefit by adopting a resolution stating its intention. The resolution of intention shall state the time and place at which the board of supervisors will hold a hearing to consider such termination. If, at the conclusion of such hearing, the board of supervisors finds and determines that the public facilities project for which the area was originally formed will not be required in the reasonably foreseeable future, or that the installation of said public facilities project may be financed more effectively by another method, the board of supervisors may adopt a resolution declaring the area of benefit terminated.
(Ord. 86-0024 § 1 (part), 1986.)
22.68.160 - Reimbursement and refund.
A.
In the event of an annual adjustment of assessment as provided by Section 22.68.130, which reduces the facilities benefit assessment, amounts in the special fund which are no longer required shall be refundable to the current owner(s) of the property as shown on the last equalized assessment roll in proportion to the amount of the original payments.
B.
In the event the board of supervisors agrees to accept consideration in lieu of facilities benefit assessments as provided by Section 22.68.140, the value of which the board of supervisors finds is greater than the amount of the otherwise applicable facilities benefit assessments, the board of supervisors may enter into an agreement with a developer pursuant to which said developer may be reimbursed for the amount of the otherwise applicable facilities benefit assessments. The agreement shall set forth the amount to be reimbursed, and the time and manner in which payments shall be made only from revenues paid into the special fund created for the area of benefit.
C.
Upon termination of an area of benefit as provided by Section 22.68.150, any money remaining in the special fund established in connection therewith shall be refunded to the current owner(s) of the property as shown on the last equalized assessment roll in proportion to the amount of the original payments.
(Ord. 86-0024 § 1 (part), 1986.)
22.68.170 - Alternative method.
This chapter is intended to establish an alternative method for the spreading of the costs of certain public improvements against the lands which will be benefited thereby; and the provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to limit the power of this board of supervisors to utilize any other method for accomplishing this purpose but shall be in addition to any other requirements which the board of supervisors is authorized to impose as a condition to approving new development pursuant to state and local laws.

Such proposal may reflect increases or decreases in the actual cost of library facilities projects or, if such projects have not been completed, then the estimated cost of the proposed library facilities. The proposal may also reflect changes in the library facilities proposed as well as the availability or lack of other funds with which to provide such facilities.
C.
The county librarian shall also present an alternative fee proposal to the board of supervisors for approval as may be necessary to insure that the library facilities mitigation fee is a fair and equitable method of distributing the costs of the library facilities necessary to accommodate the library needs generated by the development of land in the unincorporated areas of the county among the developments which will generate the increased library needs and usage.
(Ord. 98-0068 § 2 (part), 1998.)
22.72.050 - Applicability.
A.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply only to residential development projects which, as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter,* are yet to receive final discretionary approval and/or the issuance of a building permit or other development right and to any new residential use of existing buildings which has not yet commenced as of said effective date.
B.
No tract map, parcel map, conditional use permit, other land use permit or other entitlement shall be approved unless payment of the library facilities mitigation fee is made a condition of approval for any such entitlement.
(Ord. 98-0068 § 2 (part), 1998.)
* Editor's note: Ordinance 98-0068, which enacts Ch. 22.72, is effective December 26, 1998.
22.72.060 - Time of payment of fee.
A.
No building or similar permit for residential use shall be issued and no new residential use of an existing building shall occur until the applicant has paid the applicable library facilities mitigation fee to the county librarian. In the event that an applicant desires to proceed with development of a portion of the residential development project, the applicant may obtain building permits for that portion of the project after paying a proportional share of the total library facilities mitigation fee for the project to the satisfaction of the county librarian.
B.
The provisions of subsection A above shall apply to payment of the library facilities mitigation fee for a residential development project if the fee will reimburse the county for expenditures already made, or if the county has previously adopted a capital improvement plan or proposed construction schedule and has established an account and appropriated funds for the library facilities to be financed by the fee. In all other cases, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A above, payment of the fee for a residential development project shall not be required prior to the date of the final inspection or the date the certificate of occupancy is issued for the first dwelling in the development, whichever occurs first. In such cases, execution of an agreement to pay the required fee or applicable portion thereof within the time specified herein shall be a condition of issuance of the applicable building or similar permit. Such agreement shall constitute a lien for the payment of the fee and shall be enforceable as provided in Government Code Section 66007.

All interest income earned shall be credited to each account and shall be used solely for the purposes for which the fee was collected.
(Ord. 98-0068 § 2 (part), 1998.)
22.72.090 - Consideration in lieu of fee.
A.
The county librarian may accept substitute consideration in lieu of the library facilities mitigation fee required pursuant to this chapter, provided the county librarian finds that the proposed substitute consideration:
1.
Has a value equal to or greater than the applicable library facilities mitigation fee otherwise due;
2.
Is in a form acceptable to the county librarian; and
3.
Is within the scope of the applicable library facilities project.
B.
The county librarian may accept substitute consideration in lieu of a portion of the library facilities mitigation fee required pursuant to this chapter where he or she finds that the substitute consideration proposed is less than the value of the required fee but is in a form acceptable to the county librarian and is within the scope of the applicable library facilities project. Such substitute consideration may be accepted by the county librarian only after payment of an amount equal to the difference between the value of the substitute consideration, as solely determined by the county librarian, and the amount of the otherwise required fee.
(Ord. 98-0068 § 2 (part), 1998.)
22.72.100 - Reimbursement.
The provisions of Section 22.72.090 shall not prevent the execution of a reimbursement agreement between the county and a developer for that portion of the cost of library facilities paid by the developer which exceeds the need for the library facilities attributable to and reasonably related to the development.
(Ord. 98-0068 § 2 (part), 1998.)
22.72.110 - Alternative method.
This chapter is intended to establish an alternative method for the financing of public library facilities, the need for which is generated directly or indirectly by a residential development project or projects. The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to limit the power of the county to utilize any other method for accomplishing this purpose but shall be in addition to any other fees or requirements which the board of supervisors is authorized to impose as a condition to approving new development pursuant to state and local laws.
