Upon submittal by the franchisee of a proposal for the renewal of a franchise, the county shall provide prompt public notice of such proposal and, during the four-month period which begins on the completion of any proceedings under subsection A, renew the franchise or issue a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed and, at the request of the franchisee or on its own initiative, commence an administrative proceeding, after providing prompt public notice of such proceeding, in accordance with subsection (C)(2) to consider whether:
a.
The franchisee has substantially complied with the material terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law;
b.
The quality of the franchisee's service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices, but without regard to the mix, quality, or level of cable services or other services provided over the system, has been reasonable in light of community needs;
c.
The franchisee has the financial, legal and technical ability to provide the services, facilities and equipment as set forth in the franchisee's proposal; and

A transcript shall be made of any such proceeding.
3.
At the completion of a proceeding under this subsection C, the director shall issue a written decision granting or denying the proposal for renewal based upon the record of such proceeding, and transmit a copy of such decision to the franchisee. Such decision shall state the reasons therefor.
D.
Any denial of a proposal for renewal shall be based on one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in subparagraphs (a) through (d) of subsection (C)(1), pursuant to the record of the proceeding under subsection (c). The county will not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise under subsection (C)(1)(a) or on events considered under subsection (C)(1)(b) in any case in which a violation of the franchise or the events considered under subsection (C)(1)(b) occur after December 29, 1984 unless the director has provided the franchisee with notice and the opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the county has waived its right to object or has effectively acquiesced.
E.
