A.
At any time within two years from the date on which the original warrant becomes void, the payee or assignee may present such warrant to the auditor-controller or declare by affidavit that such warrant has been lost or destroyed. If upon investigation the auditor-controller determines that the facts so represented are accurate and that no loss will occur to the county, the auditor-controller is hereby authorized to draw a new warrant in favor of the payee in the same amount as the original warrant. Any such new warrant shall be subject to the same limitations as the original warrant which it replaces.
B.
If, at any time after a period of three years from the date on which the original warrant became void, the payee or assignee presents such warrant to the auditor-controller, the auditor is authorized to draw a replacement warrant in any case in which the auditor determines that it would be inequitable or unreasonable not to draw the warrant, and money is available in the county budget to make such payment on the indebtedness. If deemed necessary, the auditor may present a voided warrant to the board of supervisors for its review, approval, and appropriation of funds. Any such new warrant shall be subject to the same limitations as the original warrant which it replaces.

If at any time after the time periods specified in Sections A and B, but not more than 13 years from the date on which the original warrant became void, the payee or assignee presents a void warrant to the auditor-controller, the auditor-controller is authorized to draw a replacement warrant in any case where the auditor-controller possesses records which independently verify that the warrant has not been previously replaced and it would be inequitable or unreasonable not to draw the replacement warrant, and money is available in the county budget to make such payment on the indebtedness. If deemed necessary, the auditor may present the voided warrant to the board of supervisors for its review, approval and appropriation of funds. Any such new warrant shall be subject to the same limitations as the original warrant which it replaces. This subdivision shall not be construed to impose any record preservation duty.
