In addition to these monthly Nonelective Contributions, the County shall make two ad hoc Nonelective Contributions on behalf of each Participant in an amount equal to $250 on each of the March 28, 2014 and July 30, 2014 pay dates.
4.
No Nonelective Contribution shall be contributed for any Participant if he has not been in a pay status for at least eight hours during the prior month. Nonelective Contributions shall be reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the requisite pay status was completed. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Executive Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, an advance of approximately one-half the monthly Nonelective Contributions received as additional Eligible Earnings in accordance with Section 5.37.050F shall be reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the thirtieth day of the month in which the requisite pay status was completed and the remainder of such additional Eligible Earnings shall be reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the requisite pay status was completed.
B.
Elective Contributions. Each Eligible Employee prior to commencing his participation in the Plan and each Participant prior to the beginning of a Plan Year may irrevocably elect to have an additional dollar amount contributed by the County during a Plan Year for each month that he participates in the Plan as an Elective Contribution, not to exceed his Eligible Earnings for such month, and to have his Eligible Earnings reduced each month by an amount equal to such Elective Contribution; provided, however, that no Elective Contribution shall be contributed for any Participant if he has not been in a pay status for at least eight hours during the prior month. Such Elective Contributions on behalf of a Participant each month shall equal the amount necessary to fund the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits chosen by such Participant pursuant to the election procedures set forth in Section 5.37.060, after first applying the Nonelective Contributions for such month to the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits. In the event of contractual renegotiation, change in the method of finding, or substitution of a Taxable Benefit and/or Nontaxable Benefit during a Plan Year, the County, without prior notice to the Participants, may automatically adjust the Elective Contributions made for, and/or the Eligible Earnings paid to, Participants who have selected such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits, in accordance with increases or decreases in the cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, monthly Elective Contributions shall be apportioned over semi-monthly pay periods so that approximately one-half the monthly Elective Contributions shall be deducted from the Participant's Eligible Earnings as reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the thirtieth day of the month to which the Eligible Earnings relate and the remainder of the monthly Elective Contributions shall be deducted from the Participant's Eligible Earnings reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the fifteenth day of the following month.

Said certification shall be made in a manner determined by the County.
D.
Deletions, Additions, and Changes in Taxable Benefits and Nontaxable Benefits. The Board in its sole discretion shall designate the Taxable Benefits and Nontaxable Benefits available under the Plan in respect of any Plan Year. The Board shall have the right during any Plan Year to (1) renegotiate the terms of any County-sponsored group insurance contract providing a Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit for such Plan Year; (2) approve any renegotiated terms of any union-sponsored group insurance contract providing a Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit for such Plan Year; (3) substitute a new Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit comparable to the one available at the beginning of such Plan Year; or (4) change the method of funding any Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit for such Plan Year, without affecting Participant's elections thereof. The County shall notify Participants in writing prior to the commencement of the Plan Year as to any (a) Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit deletions or additions under the Plan; (b) changes in the amount of Contributions required in payment of any Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit or changes in the method of funding or payment of any Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit to the extent such changes are known prior to the commencement of a Plan Year; and (c) modifications in the terms and provisions of any Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit.
E.
Benefit Cost Determination. The County shall determine the cost, in dollars, to be charged to a Participant to receive a Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit for each Plan Year, the County shall consider such factors as it determines to be appropriate, including but not limited to, the cost of purchasing insurance, if applicable, to provide such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit or the out-of-pocket expenses likely to be incurred by the County to provide the same, together with an appropriate amount of administrative expenses incurred in providing such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit. The cost of receiving a particular Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit available in the Plan Year may vary among different classes of Participants who are similarly situated with respect to such factors as number of dependents, age, salary level and length of service, and may be increased or decreased during a Plan Year pursuant to the renegotiation of the group insurance contract providing such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit, the substitution of a comparable Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit, or a change in the method of funding such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit. Such costs shall be disclosed to Eligible Employees and Participants in writing prior to or contemporaneously with the distribution of election forms for the Plan Year as provided by Section 5.37.060A, and any increase or decrease during the Plan Year in the cost of a Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit shall be disclosed to Participants as soon as reasonably possible.
F.
Cash Benefit. Any portion of a Nonelective Contribution made on behalf of a Participant which is not necessary to fund the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits selected by the Participant shall be received by the Participant in the form of an increase in his Eligible Earnings, with such amount to be reflected in County payroll warrants as described in Section 5.37.040A.
(Ord. 2010-0014, § 35, 2010; Ord. 94-0102 § 25, 1994: Ord. 92-0013 § 5 (part), 1992.)

The form and content of the election form shall be such as the County shall from time to time determine to be appropriate. All election forms shall be due and returnable to the County on or before such date as the County may specify, which date shall be no later than the day prior to the commencement of the Plan Year to which such forms relate, or in the case of Eligible Employees, the day prior to the commencement of participation.
B.
Deemed Elections. Any Eligible Employee who is enrolled in a Medical Insurance Plan on the date his election form is due to be filed pursuant to subsection A of this section, or any Participant who in the current Plan Year receives one or more Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits who fails to make a timely election of Benefits for either initial participation or continued participation in the Plan, whichever is relevant, shall be deemed to have elected to receive the same type, and if applicable, the same amount, of Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits elected for the period preceding Plan participation or for the previous Plan Year. To the extent that the dollar value of the Nonelective Contribution made on behalf of such Participant exceeds the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits, the Participant shall receive the difference in additional monthly Eligible Earnings during the Plan Year. To the extent that the cost of such Nontaxable Benefits exceeds the Nonelective Contribution, the Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the County to reduce his Eligible Earnings by such amount each month as may be necessary to cover the excess cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits in accordance with the limit set forth in Section 5.37.040B. Any Participant who fails to submit the election form on or before the due date who was not enrolled in an insured health or welfare benefit program incorporated into the Plan as a Taxable Benefit and/or Nontaxable Benefit shall be deemed to have elected to receive the entire amount of the Nonelective Contributions made on his behalf during the next Plan Year as additions to his Eligible Earnings each month during such Plan Year. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented: 1) any additional monthly Eligible Earnings received due to a Participant's deemed election under this Section 5.37.060B shall be reflected in County payroll warrants as described in Section 5.37.040A, and 2) a Participant's deemed authorization to have his monthly Eligible Earnings reduced shall include an authorization to have such reduction apportioned over County payroll periods and warrants as described in Section 5.37.040B.

In the event of an extraordinary change in a Participant's circumstances, and in accordance with any applicable regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 125 of the Code, the County, in its sole discretion, may permit such Participant during the Plan Year to change the type and/or amount of Benefits to be received under the Plan for the remainder of such Plan Year.
E.
Compensation Reduction Agreement. If, in respect of any month during a Plan Year, the cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits elected by a Participant for such Plan Year exceeds the amount of Nonelective Contributions made on his behalf for such month, the Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the County, in accordance with Section 5.37.040B, to reduce his Eligible Earnings by such amount each month as is necessary to cover the excess cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits elected by such Participant and to make corresponding Elective Contributions to the Plan on his behalf. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, a Participant's deemed authorization to have his monthly Eligible Earnings reduced shall include an authorization to have such reduction apportioned over County payroll periods and warrants as described in Section 5.37.040B.
F.
Participant Accounts. The County shall establish and maintain appropriate procedures and records with respect to Benefit elections and Contributions made by and on behalf of Participants pursuant to subsections A and B of this section. The County may establish one or more accounts for each Participant for the purpose of recording such Participant's utilization of particular Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits such as uninsured health care or dependent care reimbursement benefits if available, to which specific dollar amounts of Nonelective and/or Elective Contributions have been credited. In no event, however, shall such accounts represent actual deposits of Contributions to be credited with respect to such accounts.
G.
Forfeiture of Unused Benefits. Any amount which a Participant has elected to receive during the Plan Year as a specific Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit pursuant to the election procedure set forth in subsections A and B of this section which remains unused by the Participant at the close of the Plan Year shall be forfeited to the County; provided, however, that payments of such amount may be made to the Participant up to six months beyond the close of a Plan Year so long as such payments are made under the provisions of such specific Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit for expenses incurred by the Participant during the Plan Year; provided further that up to $500 of unused amounts credited to a Participant's Health Care Spending Account may be carried over to the next Plan Year in accordance with the rules set forth in Section 5.37.160

5.37.155 - Participation.

  Except as provided in Section 5.37.160D, an Eligible Employee must reenroll during open enrollment as provided in the Election Information and Materials in order to participate in the following Plan Year. If the Eligible Employee enrolls during open enrollment, participation in the Health Care Spending Account will commence on the first day of the next following Plan Year.

5.37.160 - Payments.
The County shall from time to time, upon request of a Participant made in writing not later than the end of the Run-Out Period, reimburse all or part of the Medical Expenses incurred by the Participant during such Year; provided, however, that:
A.
All such payment during or in respect of a particular Plan Year to the Participant's Health Care Spending Account shall be limited in the aggregate to (a) his Maximum Amount; plus (b) the Carryover Amount described in Section 5.37.160B, subject to the rules in Section 5. 37.160C.
B.
Subject to the rules in Section 5.37.160C below, amounts up to $500 that remain unused under the Health Care Spending Account with respect to one Plan Year are carried over to the next Plan Year. The carryover amount is the lesser of (a) any unused amounts from the immediately preceding Plan Year, or (b) $500 (the "Carryover Amount"). Any unused amount in the Health Care Spending Account in excess of the Carryover Amount that remains unused as of the last day of the Run-Out Period shall be forfeited.
C.
A Participant's unused balance under the Health Care Spending Account at the end of the prior Plan Year will be used either: (a) to reimburse expenses incurred during the prior Plan Year and submitted during the Run-Out Period that begins at the end of the prior Plan Year (thus retroactively reducing the unused amount as of the end of the prior Plan Year), or (b) to the extent of the Carryover Amount, for expenses that are incurred at any time during the current Plan Year. Any Carryover Amount used to reimburse a prior Plan Year's expense during the Run-Out Period will reduce the Carryover Amount that may be used for current Plan Year expenses, and any of the Carryover Amount used for current Plan Year expenses will reduce the amount available to reimburse the prior Plan Year's expenses during the applicable Run-Out Period. The Health Care Spending Account treats claims for Medical Expenses as reimbursed first from unused amounts credited for the current Plan Year and, only after exhausting such amounts, as reimbursed from the Carryover Amount. Any unused amounts from the prior Plan Year that are used to reimburse a current Plan Year expense: (a) reduce the amounts available to pay prior Plan Year expenses during the Run-Out Period; (b) are counted against the Carryover Amount; and (c) cannot exceed the Carryover Amount.
D.
Notwithstanding Section 5.37.155, a Participant in a Health Care Spending Account during one Plan Year who fails to enroll in the Health Care Spending Account for the following Plan Year on a timely basis will nevertheless have a Health Care Spending Account established for him for that following Plan Year to the extent of any Carryover Amount provided for in this Section 5.37.160
E.
Payments hereunder may be made only upon such proof of the Medical Expenses in question as the County shall in its discretion require. It is not necessary that such Medical Expenses have been already paid by the Participant, his spouse or his dependents, but merely that, if not yet paid, there exists an obligation to pay them.
F.
Medical Expenses reimbursed by the Plan for a Plan Year must have been incurred during a period when the Participant (and Dependents) are covered by the Health Care Spending Account, as described in the Election Information and Materials, and submitted for reimbursement, with all required substantiation, before the end of the Run-Out Period. Accordingly, with regard to each Plan Year, the Plan will not reimburse any expenses incurred: (i) before the start of the Plan Year or, if later, before the date the Eligible Employee first becomes a Participant under Section 5.37.155; (ii) after the end of the Plan Year; (iii) after coverage terminates or while coverage is suspended as described in the Election Information and Materials, or (iv) that are not adequately substantiated before the end of the Run-Out Period.
