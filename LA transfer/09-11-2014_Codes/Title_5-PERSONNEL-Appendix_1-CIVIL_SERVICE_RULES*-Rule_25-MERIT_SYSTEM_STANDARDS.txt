Rule 25 - MERIT SYSTEM STANDARDS
Rules:

25.01 - Employment practices.
A.
No person in the classified service or seeking admission thereto shall be appointed, reduced or removed, or in any way favored or discriminated against in employment or opportunity for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, physical handicap, medical condition, marital status, age, national origin or citizenship, ancestry, political opinions or affiliations, organizational membership or affiliation, or other non-merit factors, any of which are not substantially related to successful performance of the duties of the position. "Non-merit factors" are those factors that relate exclusively to a personal or social characteristic or trait and are not substantially related to successful performance of the duties of the position. Any person who appeals alleging discrimination based on a non-merit factor must name the specific non-merit factor(s) on which discrimination is alleged to be based. No hearing shall be granted nor evidence heard relative to discrimination based on unspecified non-merit factors.
B.
Nothing in this Rule shall preclude appropriate action by an appointing power when membership in, or affiliation with, an organization may cause a conflict of interest relative to the duties of a position.

Persons adversely affected by the application of such standards may appeal to the civil service commission under provisions of Rule 4.
