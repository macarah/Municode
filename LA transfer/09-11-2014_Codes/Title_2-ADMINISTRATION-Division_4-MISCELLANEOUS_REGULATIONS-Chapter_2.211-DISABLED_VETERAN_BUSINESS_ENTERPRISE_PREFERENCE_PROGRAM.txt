Chapter 2.211 - DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PREFERENCE PROGRAM
Sections:

2.211.010 - Introduction.
The Board of Supervisors finds that it is of benefit to the County of Los Angeles to promote and facilitate the fullest possible participation by all citizens in the affairs of the County. It is also essential that opportunities be provided for full participation in our free enterprise system for disabled veterans. Further, it is the policy of the Board that the County should aid and assist, to the maximum extent possible, the interests of disabled veterans in order to preserve free competitive enterprise and to ensure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for purchase of goods or services for the County be placed with disabled veteran business enterprises.

2.211.020 - Purpose.
The County of Los Angeles Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise Preference Program is a race and gender-neutral program designed to enhance purchasing and contracting opportunities for disabled veterans within the County of Los Angeles. The program priorities were developed to promote and foster inclusiveness and economic development, as well as ongoing evaluation to assure all businesses, including disabled veteran business enterprises, are provided equal opportunities in County purchasing and contracting activities.
