325.10 - Roadway clearance.
The fire code official or commissioner may require removal and clearance of all flammable vegetation or other combustible growth for a minimum of 10 feet on each side of every roadway, whether public or private. The fire code official or commissioner may enter upon private property to inspect, remove, and clear vegetation and growth as required by this section and may charge the responsible party for the cost of such action. This section shall not apply to single specimens of trees, ornamental shrubbery, or cultivated ground cover such as green grass, ivy, succulents, or similar plants used as ground cover, provided that they do not form a means of readily transmitting fire. As used in this section, "roadway" means that portion of a highway or private street improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel. The minimum clearance of 10 feet may be increased if the fire code official determines additional distance is required to provide reasonable fire safety.
