Payments made pursuant to sections 6.78.350.L, R, and S shall be made on or before the 30th day following the employee's Separation from Service.
1.
For purposes of this section 6.78.350, Separation from Service occurs when the employee terminates employment (including a termination from employment due to death or retirement) with the county (and any other public entity of which the Los Angeles County board of supervisors is the governing body).
2.
A termination of employment will have occurred only if the county and employee reasonably anticipate that the level of bona fide services to be performed by the employee after that date (whether as an employee or an independent contractor) will permanently decrease to no more than 49% of the average level of bona fide services performed (whether as an employee or an independent contractor) over the immediately preceding testing period. For these purposes, the testing period is the preceding 36-month period or the full period of services to the county if the employee has been providing services for less than 36 months.
a.
A termination of employment does not occur while the employee is on a Bona Fide Leave of Absence (as defined herein) if the period of such leave does not exceed 6 months or, if longer, so long as the individual retains a right to reemployment with the county under applicable statute, ordinance or contract. A Bona Fide Leave of Absence includes military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence under applicable rules, provided that there is a reasonable expectation that the employee will return to perform services for the county. If the Bona Fide Leave of Absence exceeds 6 months and the individual does not retain a right to reemployment under applicable statute, ordinance or contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following that 6-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Bona Fide Leave of Absence is due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six months, and where the impairment causes the employee to be unable to perform the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, a period of 29 months is substituted for the 6-month period otherwise applicable under this provision.
b.
For purposes of sections 6.78.350.T.2.a., for periods during which an employee is on a Bona Fide Leave of Absence and has not otherwise terminated employment, the employee is treated as providing bona fide services at a level equal to the level of services that the employee would have been required to perform to receive the compensation paid during that Bona Fide Leave of Absence. Periods during which the employee is on an unpaid Bona Fide Leave of Absence are disregarded for the purposes of section 6.78.350.T.2.a.
