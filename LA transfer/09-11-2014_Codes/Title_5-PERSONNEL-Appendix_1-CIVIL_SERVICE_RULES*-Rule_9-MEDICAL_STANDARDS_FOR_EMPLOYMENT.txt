Rule 9 - MEDICAL STANDARDS FOR EMPLOYMENT
Rules:

9.01 - Purpose of medical standards.
The director of personnel, shall establish medical standards for county employment, and shall specify the physical category of each classification in order to:
A.
Ensure that proper consideration is given to the relationship between each person's health status and the physical, psychological and environmental demands of the duties such person is to perform; and
B.
Select employees who can be expected to remain in a state of good health for a reasonable period of service, consistent with the economics of the retirement, sick leave, and other employee benefit programs.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
9.02 - Appeal of medical standards.
The appointing authority, employee, or applicant for county employment who can provide medical evidence that a medical standard adopted by the director of personnel is unreasonable may submit this evidence to the director of personnel for review.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
9.03 - Medical examinations.
A.
The director of personnel shall require an appropriate medical examination by a county examining physician or any other reasonable evidence of the applicant's health status. The examination may include X-rays, laboratory tests, or any other medical tests or evidence needed to determine that the applicant's health status is consistent with the standards referred to in Rule 9.01.
B.
The director of personnel may require any employee or candidate for employment to be reexamined at any time prior to his original appointment, during his probationary period, or at the time of reinstatement.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
9.04 - Determination of qualification following medical examination.
Following the medical examination, the director of personnel shall determine whether each applicant is qualified. In arriving at this determination, the director of personnel shall consider:
A.
The applicant's health status, as indicated by the medical examination;
B.
The physical, psychological and environmental demands of the position the applicant is to perform within the purview of the standards referred to in Rule 9.01; and
C.
The needs of the service, including retirement, sick leave, and other employee benefit programs.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
9.05 - Requirement of qualification prior to employment.
A.
No applicant in an open examination shall be employed in a permanent, temporary or recurrent position prior to a determination by the director of personnel, following a medical examination, that the applicant is qualified for the duties to be performed; provided, however, that the director of personnel may authorize in specific cases:
1.
Employment prior to medical examination for a period the director deems reasonable;
2.
Employment of persons who are found to have certain disqualifying, but correctable, medical conditions. Such employment may be for a period the director deems reasonable, but not to exceed five months.
B.
An appointment made before the director of personnel determines that the applicant is qualified must be considered as contingent upon such determination.
C.
If the director of personnel finds that an applicant is a poor long-term risk for permanent employment but otherwise meets the standards the director of personnel may approve an appointment on a temporary basis, if a temporary appointment is otherwise authorized by Rule 13.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
9.06 - Review of medical findings.
A.
An applicant or an employee who has been disqualified due to failure to meet the medical standards may request a review of the case. The applicant shall be entitled to present new or additional medical evidence related to the case at any time his/her name is on an active eligible list.
B.
The director of personnel, upon receipt of such request, shall designate a physician to review the case. Such physician, after review of the case in light of the purpose of medical standards as stated in Rule 9.01, shall report the findings to the director of personnel. The director of personnel shall decide on the applicant's medical qualification and notify the applicant of the decision.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
9.07 - Medical reevaluation.
A.
The director of personnel may require a reasonable medical reevaluation at the time of promotion, demotion, reassignment, or other changes of status of an employee from one class to another class with increased physical, psychological and environmental demands. Such change of status shall not be completed until the employee has shown that the increased physical, psychological and environmental demands are met.
B.
An employee may request, or an appointing authority may, with the consent of the director of personnel, require an employee to have a medical reevaluation. The purpose of such reevaluation must be to determine the capacities of the employee to perform the duties of the employee's job satisfactorily and without undue hazard to the employee or others. Accordingly, such reevaluation shall be concerned only with the medical condition related to the satisfactory performance of the required duties or to the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the employee or others.
C.
If the employee's condition is the result of a work-incurred injury which falls within the jurisdiction of the workers' compensation appeals board, the determination by the director of personnel of the employee's medical capacities shall be based solely upon the medical evidence used by the appeals board in its disposition of the case.
D.
The appointing authority, with the consent of the director of personnel, may require periodic reevaluations for classes in the safety series to assure adequate capability to protect the public.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
9.08 - Partially or fully incapacitated employees.
Whenever, upon medical reevaluation or competent medical or legal evidence, an employee who has previously qualified is found to be unable to perform the duties of his/her position satisfactorily, due to a medical incapacity of a continuing nature:
A.
The employee may submit a request to the appointing authority for reassignment, voluntary demotion, or transfer to a position for which the employee has the qualifications. Any voluntary demotion under this rule must be with the approval of the director of personnel.
B.
If no action is taken under paragraph A of this Rule, the director of personnel shall, consistent with his determination of the employee's medical capacities, recommend the most appropriate of the following alternatives:
1.
Return of the employee to suitable work through one of the following means:
a.
Modification of the employee's duties or change of his/her assignment,
b.
Change of classification or reduction to another position in the employee's department,
c.
Transfer to a position in another department. Where appropriate, this recommendation will include a retraining program;
2.
Disability retirement of the employee, in accordance with the employee's eligibility under appropriate provisions of the Government Code;
3.
Release of the employee in accordance with paragraph C of this Rule. The appointing authority considering the recommendations of the director of personnel may change classification or reduce the employee to a position for which the employee is qualified or for which the employee can be trained within a reasonable period of time. Where the appointing authority indicates that he/she cannot follow the recommendation of the director of personnel for a change of classification or reduction, the director shall place the employee on appropriate departmental reemployment lists, provided the employee's performance has been competent or better. Such lists shall only be applicable to positions that are compatible with the employee's medical capacities, and training and/or experience.
C.
If there is no suitable position in which the employee can perform satisfactorily, the appointing authority may release the employee, subject to the applicable provisions of Rule 18, said release to be without prejudice as to reemployment should the employee's condition improve.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
