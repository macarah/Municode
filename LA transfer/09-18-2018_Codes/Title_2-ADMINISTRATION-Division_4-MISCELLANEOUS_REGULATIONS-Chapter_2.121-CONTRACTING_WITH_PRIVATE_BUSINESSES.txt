A.
Conditions for Use. Contracts shall be awarded by competitive sealed bidding unless it is determined in writing by the department recommending the award of a contract that this method is not practicable. Factors to be considered in determining whether competitive sealed bidding is not practicable shall include whether:
1.
Specifications can be prepared that permit award on the basis of either the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated bid price; and
2.
The available sources, the time and place of performance, and other relevant circumstances are appropriate for the use of competitive sealed bidding.
B.
Evaluation Factors. The invitation for bids shall state whether award shall be made on the basis of the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated bid price. If the latter basis is used, the objective measurable criteria to be utilized shall be set forth in the invitation for bids.
C.
Public Notice. Public notice of the invitation for bids shall be given a sufficient time prior to the date set forth therein for the opening of bids by the posting of a copy of the invitation for bid in the office of the purchasing agent.

A.
When Used. When the department recommending the award of a contract determines in writing that the use of competitive sealed bidding is not practicable, and except as provided in Section 2.121.350, a contract may be awarded by competitive negotiation.
B.
Use After Unsuccessful Competitive Sealed Bidding. Contracts may be competitively negotiated when it is determined in writing by the department recommending the award of a contract that the bid prices received by competitive sealed bidding either are unreasonable as to all or part of the requirements, or were not independently reached in open competition, and for which:
1.
Each responsible bidder has been notified of the intention to negotiate and is given reasonable opportunity to negotiate;
2.
The negotiated price is lower than the lowest rejected bid by any responsible bidder; and
3.
The negotiated price is the lowest negotiated price offered by any responsible offeror.
C.
Public Notice. Adequate public notice of the request for proposals shall be given in the same manner as provided in subsection C of Section 2.121.320.
D.
Evaluation Factors. The request for proposals shall indicate the relative importance of price and other evaluation factors.
E.
Award. Except in those instances where all bids are rejected pursuant to Section 2.121.290, award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the county, taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals.
F.
Discussion with All Responsible Offerors. Written or oral discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined in writing to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award. Discussions shall not disclose any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors.
(Ord. 90-0030 § 3 (part), 1990.)
2.121.340 - Negotiations after competitive sealed bidding where all bids exceed available funds.
A.
Determination. In the event that all bids submitted pursuant to competitive sealed bidding under Section 2.121.320 result in bid prices in excess of the funds available and the department recommending the award of the contract determines in writing:
1.
That there are no additional funds available from any source so as to permit an award to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder; and
2.
The best interest of the county will not permit the delay attendant to a resolicitation under revised specifications, and/or for reduced level of services, under competitive sealed bidding as provided in Section 2.121.320; then a negotiated award may be made as set forth in subsections B and C of this section.
B.
Negotiation with Multiple Bidders. Where there is more than one bidder, competitive negotiations pursuant to Section 2.121.330 shall be conducted with the three (two if there are only two) bidders determined in writing to be the lowest responsive and responsible bidders to the competitive sealed bid invitation. Such competitive negotiations shall be conducted under the following restrictions:
1.
If discussions pertaining to the revision of the specifications or quantities are held with any potential offeror, all other potential offerors shall be afforded an opportunity to take part in such discussions;
2.
An addendum to the invitation for bids, based upon revised specifications or quantities, shall be issued as promptly as possible, shall provide for an expeditious response to the revised requirements, and shall be awarded upon the basis of the lowest bid price or lowest evaluated bid price submitted by any responsive and responsible offeror. No discussion shall be conducted with offerors after submission of proposals except for a compelling reason as determined in writing by the department recommending the award of a contract. All addenda shall state that award is to be made without discussions except as herein provided.
C.
Negotiation with Single Bidder.

A determination of responsibility of a bidder or offeror shall be made. All invitations for bids and requests for proposals shall contain a provision reading substantially as follows:
"A reasonable inquiry to determine the responsibility of a bidder or offeror may be conducted. The unreasonable failure of a bidder or offeror to promptly supply information in connection with such inquiry, including but not limited to information regarding past performance, financial stability, and ability to perform on schedule, may be grounds for a determination of nonresponsibility with respect to such a bidder or offeror."
