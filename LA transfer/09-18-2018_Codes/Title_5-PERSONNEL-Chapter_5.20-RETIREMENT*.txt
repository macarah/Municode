In departments headed by an elected official, the board shall establish a maximum percentage of base salary which can be provided as a bonus to managers. Payment authorized by this section may be in lump sums or up to 24 monthly payments in accordance with the determination of the department head.

The County Medical Subsidy may be applied toward the cost of purchasing any coverage level (e.g., retiree-only or family) for any medical plan option under the LACERA Group Health Plans that is available to the New Member and his or her Eligible Dependents, subject to the rules and limitations set forth in subsection 5.20.085E. below. A New Member and his or her Eligible Dependents (or surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner and other Eligible Survivors) must be enrolled in the same medical plan, unless some, but not all, eligible family members are Medicare-eligible. In that case, the Medicare-eligible individual(s) must enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan or Medicare supplement plan as provided in subsection 5.20.085E., and the non-Medicare-eligible individual(s) must enroll in the corresponding non-Medicare LACERA Group Health Plan. In addition, upon a New Member's death, if there is no surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner entitled to a County Medical Subsidy, each Eligible Survivor may enroll in a separate medical plan, the County Medical Subsidy shall be allocated pro rata among such Eligible Survivors and each Eligible Survivor may apply his or her allocable share of the County Medical Subsidy toward the cost of the medical plan selected.
b.
The County Dental Subsidy may be applied toward the cost of purchasing any coverage level (e.g., retiree-only or family) for any dental plan option under the LACERA Group Health Plans that is available to the New Member and his or her Eligible Dependents. A New Member and his or her Eligible Dependents (or surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner and other Eligible Survivors) must be enrolled in the same dental plan. Provided, however, that upon a New Member's death, if there is no surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner entitled to a County Dental Subsidy, each Eligible Survivor may enroll in a separate dental plan, the County Dental Subsidy shall be allocated pro rata among such Eligible Survivors and each Eligible Survivor may apply his or her allocable share of the County Dental Subsidy toward the cost of the dental plan selected.
c.
The County Vision Subsidy may be applied toward the cost of purchasing any coverage level (e.g., retiree-only or family) for any vision plan option under the LACERA Group Health Plans that is available to the New Member and his or her Eligible Dependents. A New Member and his or her Eligible Dependents (or surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner and other Eligible Survivors) must be enrolled in the same vision plan. Provided, however, that upon a New Member's death, if there is no surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner entitled to a County Vision Subsidy, each Eligible Survivor may enroll in a separate vision plan, the County Vision Subsidy shall be allocated pro rata among such Eligible Survivors and each Eligible Survivor may apply his or her allocable share of the County Vision Subsidy toward the cost of the vision plan selected.
E.
Coverage Options for Medicare-Eligible Individuals; Medicare Part B Subsidy.

A New Member or Eligible Dependent who: (a) fails to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B after becoming eligible; (b) assigns his or her Medicare benefit to a plan other than a LACERA Group Health Plan; or (c) loses Medicare coverage, will be terminated from participation in the Tier Two Retiree Health Care Program. A New Member or Eligible Dependent who has been terminated from the Tier Two Retiree Health Care Program, and who subsequently meets the requirements for eligibility, may be re-enrolled in the Tier Two Retiree Health Care Program after a six (6) month waiting period.
2.
Medicare Part B Subsidy. If the New Member and/or his or her Eligible Dependents enroll in Medicare Parts A and B and a LACERA Group Health Plan that is a Medicare Advantage plan or Medicare supplement plan, the County will reimburse a total amount equal to the standard self-only coverage premium amount for Medicare Part B. Regardless of the number of family members enrolled in Medicare, the total Medicare Part B Subsidy amount paid with respect to the New Member and/or his or her Eligible Dependents shall in no case exceed the standard self-only coverage premium amount for Medicare Part B. This Medicare Part B Subsidy shall not include any means testing or late enrollment fees or penalties.
F.
Administration. LACERA shall administer the Tier Two Retiree Health Care Program as provided in the 2014 Agreement.
G.
Amendment and Termination.
1.
Generally. Subject to Section 5.20.085G.2. and the County's collective bargaining obligations, any restrictions imposed by California Government Code Section 31692, and the terms of the 2014 Agreement, the Tier Two Retiree Health Care Program and County Code Section 5.20.085 may be amended or terminated by the County at any time. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, the County may, subject to its collective bargaining obligations, amend or terminate the Tier Two Retiree Health Program with regard to County employees who, at the time of such amendment or termination, have not yet been hired or placed in an employment classification eligible for LACERA membership. In addition, subject to Section 5.20.085G.2. and the 2014 Agreement, the terms of the Tier Two Retiree Health Care Program and this Section 5.20.085 of the County Code may be amended or modified with regard to current New Members and their Eligible Dependents, provided that any amendment or modification ensures that such New Members and their Eligible Dependents continue to receive health care benefits that are comparable to those benefits provided under the current terms of the Tier Two Retiree Health Care Program. Such potential amendments or modifications include, but are not limited to, those that are necessary or desirable to address changes in the law, changes in the health insurance market or changes in the way in which health care services are delivered and paid for in the United States.
2.
Represented Employees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.20.085.G.1 above, with regard to New Members who are in a bargaining unit represented by an employee organization certified by the County Employee Relations Commission, any amendment or termination of the Tier Two Retiree Health Care Program and County Code Section 5.20.085 made by the County shall be subject to any applicable collective bargaining obligations and any procedural rights or other rights such employee organization may have to challenge the legality of actions taken by the County.
