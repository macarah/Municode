Nonelective Contributions shall be reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the requisite pay status was completed. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, an advance of approximately one-half the monthly Nonelective Contributions received as additional Eligible Earnings in accordance with Section 5.28.050E shall be reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the thirtieth day of the month in which the requisite pay status was completed and the remainder of such additional Eligible Earnings shall be reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the requisite pay status was completed.

Such Elective Contribution on behalf of a Participant each month shall equal the amount necessary to fund the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits chosen by such Participant pursuant to the election procedure set forth in Section 5.28.060, after first applying the Nonelective Contribution for such month to the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits. In the event of contractual renegotiation, change in method of funding, or substitution of a Taxable Benefit and/or Nontaxable Benefit during a Plan Year, the County, without prior notice to Participants, may automatically adjust the Elective Contributions made for, and/or the Eligible Earnings paid to, Participants who have selected such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits in accordance with increases or decreases in the cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, monthly Elective Contributions shall be apportioned over semi-monthly pay periods so that approximately one-half the monthly Elective Contributions shall be deducted from the Participant's Eligible Earnings as reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the thirtieth day of the month to which the Eligible Earnings relate and the remainder of the monthly Elective Contributions shall be deducted from the Participant's Eligible Earnings reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the fifteenth day of the following month.

Eligibility to receive or waive any particular Taxable Benefit by a Participant shall require satisfaction of all waiting periods, eligibility rules, election requirements and other requirements and conditions which are set forth in the Election Information or the Materials and which are applicable to him and his employment and relate to such Taxable Benefit.

The cost of receiving a particular Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit available in the Plan Year may vary among different classes of Participants who are similarly situated with respect to such factors as number of dependents, age, salary level and length of service and may be increased or decreased during a Plan Year pursuant to the renegotiation of the group insurance contract providing such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit, the substitution of a comparable Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit, or a change in the method of funding such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit. Such costs shall be disclosed to Eligible Employees and Participants in writing prior to or contemporaneously with the distribution of election forms for the Plan Year as provided by Section 5.28.060A and any increase or decrease during the Plan Year in the cost of a Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit shall be disclosed to Participants as soon as reasonably possible.

Except as provided in subsection (B)(2) of this section, any Eligible Employee who is enrolled in an insured health or welfare benefit program incorporated into the Plan as a Taxable Benefit or Non-taxable Benefit on the date his election form is due to be filed pursuant to subsection A of this section, or any Participant who in the current Plan Year receives one or more Taxable Benefits or Non-taxable Benefits who fails to make a timely election of Benefits for continued participation in the Plan, shall be deemed to have elected to receive the same type, and if applicable, the same amount, of Taxable Benefits and Non-taxable Benefits elected for the previous Plan Year except as otherwise provided in the Election Information. To the extent that the dollar value of the Non-elective Contribution made on behalf of such Participant exceeds the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Non-taxable Benefits, the Participant shall receive the difference in additional monthly Eligible Earnings during the Plan Year except as otherwise provided in the Election Information. To the extent that the cost of such Non-taxable Benefits exceeds the Non-elective Contributions, the Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the County to reduce his Eligible Earnings by such amount each month as may be necessary to cover the excess cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Non-taxable Benefits, in accordance with the limit set forth in Section 5.28.040B. Any Eligible Employee or Participant who fails to submit the election form on or before the due date who was not so enrolled in an insured health or welfare benefit program shall be deemed to have elected to receive the entire amount of the Non-elective Contributions made on his behalf during the next Plan Year as additions to his Eligible Earnings each month during such Plan Year, except as otherwise provided in the Election Information. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented: 1) any additional monthly Eligible Earnings received due to a Participant's deemed election under this Section 5.28.060B shall be reflected in County payroll warrants as described in Section 5.28.040A, and 2) a Participant's deemed authorization to have his monthly Eligible Earnings reduced shall include an authorization to have such reduction apportioned over County payroll periods and warrants as described in Section 5.28.040B.
2.
No Eligible Employee may participate in the Plan unless he satisfies all conditions of participation under the Plan and positively elects to participate during the election period for the 1995 Plan Year. No Eligible Employee who fails to make a timely election of benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to have elected initial participation under this Subdivision 1 of Chapter 5.28, but shall rather be deemed to have elected initial participation under Subdivision 2 of Chapter 5.27.
C.
Irrevocability of Elections. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, all elections made by or on behalf of Participants pursuant to subsections A and B of this section shall be irrevocable for the Plan Year for which made or deemed to be made.

In the event of an extraordinary change in a Participant's circumstances, and in accordance with any applicable regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 125 of the Code, the County, in its sole discretion, may permit such Participant during the Plan Year to change the type and/or amount of Benefits to be received under the Plan for the remainder of such Plan Year.
E.
Amnesty for Ineligible Dependents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, the County shall provide amnesty from discipline and payment recovery to any employee whose Ineligible Dependent(s) are removed from County-sponsored or County-approved health plan coverage as a consequence of a dependent eligibility verification process authorized by the CEO; provided, however, that no such amnesty shall be extended to any employee who obtains such coverage through willful misrepresentation or other fraudulent means.
F.
Compensation Reduction Agreement. If, in respect of any month during a Plan Year, the cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Non-taxable Benefits elected by a Participant for such Plan Year exceeds the amount of Non-elective Contributions made on his behalf for such month, the Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the County in accordance with the limit set forth in Section 5.28.040B hereof, to reduce his Eligible Earnings by such amount each month as is necessary to cover the excess cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Non-taxable Benefits elected by such Participant and to make corresponding Elective Contributions to the Plan on his behalf. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, a Participant's deemed authorization to have his monthly Eligible Earnings reduced shall include an authorization to have such reduction apportioned over County payroll periods and warrants as described in Section 5.28.040B.
G.
Participant Accounts. The County shall establish and maintain appropriate procedures and records with respect to Benefit elections and Contributions made by and on behalf of Participants pursuant to subsections A and B of this section. The County may establish one or more accounts for each Participant for the purpose of recording such Participant's utilization of particular Non-taxable Benefits, such as uninsured health care or dependent care reimbursement benefits if available, to which specific dollar amounts of Non-elective and/or Elective Contributions have been credited. In no event, however, shall such accounts represent actual deposits of Contributions into any fund, nor shall any interest be credited with respect to such accounts.
H.
Forfeiture of Unused Benefits. Any amount which a Participant has elected to receive during the Plan Year as a specific Taxable Benefit or Non-taxable Benefit pursuant to the election procedure set forth in subsections A and B of this section which remains unused by the Participant at the close of the Plan Year shall be forfeited to the County; provided, however, that payments of such amount may be made to the Participant up to six months beyond the close of a Plan Year so long as such payments are made under the provisions of such specific Taxable Benefit or Non-taxable Benefit for expenses incurred by the Participant during the Plan Year; provided further that up to $500 of unused amounts credited to a Participant's Health Care Reimbursement Account may be carried over to the next Plan Year in accordance with the rules set forth in Section 5.30.030.

Except as provided in subsection (B)(2) of this section, any Eligible Employee who is enrolled in an insured health or welfare benefit program incorporated into the Plan as a Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit on the date his election form is due to be filed pursuant to subsection A of this section, or any Participant who in the current Plan Year receives one or more Taxable Benefits or Nontaxable Benefits who fails to make a timely election of Benefits for continued participation in the Plan, shall be deemed to have elected to receive the same type, and if applicable, the same amount, of Taxable Benefits and Nontaxable Benefits elected for the previous Plan Year, except as otherwise provided in the Election Information. To the extent that the dollar value of the Nonelective Contribution made on behalf of such Participant exceeds the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits, the Participant shall receive the difference in additional monthly Eligible Earnings during the Plan Year except as otherwise provided in the Election Information. To the extent that the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits exceeds the Nonelective Contributions, the Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the County to reduce his Eligible Earnings by such amount each month as may be necessary to cover the excess cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits, in accordance with the limit set forth in Section 5.28.240B. Any Eligible Employee or Participant who fails to submit the election form on or before the due date who was not so enrolled in an insured health or welfare benefit program shall be deemed to have elected to receive the entire amount of the Nonelective Contributions made on his behalf during the Plan Year as additions to his Eligible Earnings each month during such Plan Year, except as otherwise provided in the Election Information. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented: 1) any additional monthly Eligible Earnings received due to a Participant's deemed election under this Section 5.28.260B shall be reflected in County payroll warrants as described in Section 5.28.240A, and 2) a Participant's deemed authorization to have his monthly Eligible Earnings reduced shall include an authorization to have such reduction apportioned over County payroll periods and warrants as described in Section 5.28.240B.
2.
No Eligible Employee may participate in the Plan unless he satisfies all conditions of participation under the Plan and positively elects to participate during the election period for the 1995 Plan Year. No Eligible Employee who fails to make a timely election of benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to have elected participation under this Subdivision 2 of Chapter 5.28, but shall rather be deemed to have elected initial participation under Subdivision 2 of Chapter 5.27.
C.
Irrevocability of Elections. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, all elections made by or on behalf of Participants pursuant to subsections A and B of this section shall be irrevocable for the Plan Year for which made or deemed to be made.
D.
Election Changes During the Plan Year. In the event of an extraordinary change in a Participant's circumstances, and in accordance with any applicable regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 125 of the Code, the County, in its sole discretion, may permit such Participant during the Plan Year to change the type and/or amount of Benefits to be received under the Plan for the remainder of such Plan Year.
E.
Amnesty for Ineligible Dependents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, the County shall provide amnesty from discipline and payment recovery to any employee whose Ineligible Dependent(s) are removed from County-sponsored or County-approved health plan coverage as a consequence of a dependent eligibility verification process authorized by the CEO; provided, however, that no such amnesty shall be extended to any employee who obtains such coverage through willful misrepresentation or other fraudulent means.
F.
Compensation Reduction Agreement. If, in respect of any month during a Plan Year, the cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Non-taxable Benefits elected by a Participant for such Plan Year exceeds the amount of Non-elective Contributions made on his behalf for such month, the Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the County, in accordance with the limit set forth in Section 5.28.240B hereof, to reduce his Eligible Earnings by such amount each month as is necessary to cover the excess cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Non-taxable Benefits elected by such Participant and to make corresponding Elective Contributions to the Plan on his behalf. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, a Participant's deemed authorization to have his monthly Eligible Earnings reduced shall include an authorization to have such reduction apportioned over County payroll periods and warrants as described in Section 5.28.240B.
G.
Participant Accounts. The County shall establish and maintain appropriate procedures and records with respect to Benefit elections and Contributions made by and on behalf of Participants pursuant to subsections A and B of this section. The County may establish one or more accounts for each Participant for the purpose of recording such Participant's utilization of particular Non-taxable Benefits, such as uninsured health care or dependent care reimbursement benefits if available, to which specific dollar amounts of Non-elective and/or Elective Contributions have been credited. In no event, however, shall such accounts represent actual deposits of Contributions into any fund, nor shall any interest be credited with respect to such accounts.
H.
Forfeiture of Unused Benefits. Any amount which a Participant has elected to receive during the Plan Year as a specific Taxable Benefit or Non-taxable Benefit pursuant to the election procedure set forth in subsections A and B of this section which remains unused by the Participant at the close of the Plan Year shall be forfeited to the County; provided, however, that payments of such amount may be made to the Participant up to six months beyond the close of a Plan Year so long as such payments are made under the provisions of such specific Taxable Benefits or Non-taxable Benefits for expenses incurred by the Participants during the Plan Year; provided further that up to $500 of unused amounts credited to a Participant's Health Care Reimbursement Account may be carried over to the next Plan Year in accordance with the rules set forth in Section 5.30.030.

3.
The Eligible Participant dies, retires, or terminates employment with the County;

C.
Medical Records and Medical Examination. The Claims Administrator may require such additional evidence, as is deemed necessary, including copies of medical records, and/or a medical examination at County expense to determine the existence, cause and extent of any injury or illness which may be the basis of a claim under the STD Plan.

E.
Appeal. A Participant may appeal any denial, cessation, or cancellation of benefits under the STD Plan by filing a written notice of appeal with the Claims Administrator, together with any pertinent supporting medical documentation. The Claims Administrator shall conduct a full and fair evaluation of the appeal and render a decision, which shall be final. The appeal from the Participant, and the final decision from the Claims Administrator shall be completed within the time frames established for such purposes in the Election Information.

However, in the case of the LTD Health Survivor of an Eligible Participant or Covered Employee with at least five years but less than ten years of service credited with LACERA and whose disability and/or death as a direct consequence and result of injury or disease did not arise out of and in the course of the performance of his or her assigned duties, the cessation of benefits will be postponed unless and until the LTD Health Survivor has received LTD Health Insurance Benefits for a period of two years.

(2)
Any eligible employee receiving disability benefits under this Chapter 5.28 or completing the Waiting Period: (1) shall not be entitled to become covered by (if not already covered), or elect to increase the level of, the LTD Health Insurance Benefit unless and until the employee returns to work as a Covered Employee, and (2) will not be entitled to become covered by (if not already covered), or elect to increase the level of, the LTD Health Insurance Benefit with regard to that same disability unless and until the employee returns to active employment as a Covered Employee for at least 6 months.

5.28.460 - Benefits.
A.
Payment of Benefits. An Eligible Participant shall begin accruing the benefit determined under Section 5.28.450 on the first day following the expiration of the Waiting Period. Except as otherwise herein provided, such benefit shall be paid until the Eligible Participant's Total Disability ceases.
B.
Basic Monthly Benefit. The basic monthly benefit payable to the Eligible Participant shall be the Participant's Basic Monthly Compensation multiplied by the percent determined under Section 5.28.450, subtracting therefrom other income benefits as specified in subsection C of this section.
C.
Other Income Benefits. Other income benefits are those benefits identified below to which the Eligible Participant is entitled. These other income benefits, payable either periodically or in a lump sum, are:
1.
The amount of any salary or other compensation, including sick leave, vacation, annual leave, or other pay the eligible Participant receives from the County which shall be coordinated with the LTD benefit as specified in the Election Information. For purposes of this paragraph, "compensation" shall not include cash or other compensation resulting from any County contribution to a County-sponsored cafeteria benefit plan. Nor shall compensation include any payment for accrued sick leave, vacation, annual leave, or other accrued time when such payment is made on account of an employee's termination from County service or an employee's death. Employees who have not terminated County service may use sick leave, vacation, annual leave, or other accrued time in lieu of LTD benefits as otherwise provided by this Code; provided, however, that, in such case, the substitution shall be made on a day for day basis (not dollar for dollar basis) resulting in one day's loss of LTD benefits for each day of substituted time;
2.
50 percent of any other salary, compensation or income the Eligible Participant receives from any other employer, or otherwise earns;
3.
The amount of any benefits with respect to the same disability or disabilities and with respect to the same period for which the basic monthly benefit is payable under the LTD Plan when such benefits are provided or payable:

Section 424(A)(2), and payable to the employee without regard to any deductions from such benefits which might be made:
i.
On account of work, or
ii.
Because of the employee's refusal to accept rehabilitation; provided, however, that other benefits, for purposes of this LTD Plan, shall not include any cost-of-living adjustments applicable to benefits payable under the Federal Social Security Act subsequent to the commencement date of such benefits. If the Eligible Participant is eligible for both retirement benefits and disability benefits under the Federal Social Security Act and receives retirement benefits in lieu of disability benefits, other income shall include the amount of such retirement benefits;
4.
The Amount of retirement benefits that the Eligible Participant receives under Retirement Plans A, B, C, D, or G. For the purposes of this paragraph, such retirement benefits shall not include any cost-of-living adjustments granted subsequent to the date any benefits become payable under this LTD Plan. In the event an Eligible Participant was eligible for retirement benefits under Retirement Plans A, B, C, D, or G but was not receiving such benefits, any such benefits that he would have received shall be estimated by the CEO for purposes of calculating any benefit due under this LTD Plan;
5.
In the event of other income benefits received in the form of a lump-sum payment or payments, the basic monthly benefit shall not commence or continue until the total of all such basic monthly benefits otherwise payable under this Plan equals the aggregate amount of such lump-sum payments.

Cost-of-Living Adjustment. A cost-of-living adjustment shall be applied to the basic monthly disability benefit on the first day following the completion of 24 months of eligibility for such benefit, and annually thereafter for as long as the Participant is entitled to benefits under the LTD Plan. Such adjustment shall equal the annual percentage increase, calculated to the nearest one-tenth of one percent, in the cost of living as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the Los Angeles/Riverside/Orange Counties Metropolitan Area for the preceding January 1st; provided, however, no increase resulting from such calculation shall exceed two percent.

F.

G.
Return to Part-Time Work. Any Eligible Participant may return to County employment on a part-time basis pursuant to a program approved by the CAO and may receive disability benefit payments during the period of such employment; provided, however, that 70 percent of any salary, compensation, or income earned under such arrangement shall be subtracted from the basic monthly benefit.

5.28.470 - Claims.
A.
Claim Forms. The County shall furnish the Participant with the appropriate forms for applying for benefits and for filing Evidence of Disability. If such forms are requested by the Participant and not furnished in a timely manner by the County, the Participant shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements for filing an application for benefits under this LTD Plan, provided Evidence of Disability is submitted within the period of time provided in this LTD Plan for applying for benefits.
B.
Application for Benefits. Application for disability benefits must be filed with the Claims Administrator in accordance with the procedures established for such purpose in the Election Information. However, in the event application is not made within one year from the first day of absence due to the claimed disability, the waiting period otherwise provided for in this Plan shall be extended by one day for each day the application is delayed beyond one year from the first day of absence due to total disability unless the employee's disability precludes submission of an application within said one year, in which case, the one year deadline may be extended by the CEO or his designee. Consideration of such extension by the CEO or his designee is contingent upon the provision of an application and all required medical documentation as soon as reasonably possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no benefits shall be paid under this Plan if application is not made within thirty months from the first day of absence due to total disability, provided, however, that the CEO or its designee may, in its sole discretion, extend the 30-month deadline if the CEO or its designee determines that extension of the deadline is warranted due to equitable considerations.
C.
Evidence of Disability. Written medical certification of Total Disability must be submitted by a Physician, practicing within the scope of his license, to the County within 90 days after an application for benefits has been filed. Failure to furnish Evidence of Disability within the time required will not invalidate or reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to give such evidence within such time; provided that the Evidence of Disability is furnished as soon as reasonably possible. However, a day-for-day penalty period will be extended to the six-month qualifying waiting period for each day the claim is not completed under this LTD Plan in the event the required Evidence of Disability is not furnished within:
1.
One year from the first day of absence, however, in the event evidence of disability is not provided within one year from the first day of absence due to the claimed disability, the waiting period otherwise provided for in this Plan shall be extended by one day for each day the application is delayed beyond one year from the first day of absence due to total disability unless the employee's disability precludes submission of an application within said one year, in which case, the one year deadline may be extended by the CEO or his designee. Consideration of such extension by the CEO or his designee is contingent upon the provision of an application and all required medical documentation as soon as reasonably possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no benefits shall be paid under this Plan if application is not made within thirty months from the first day of absence, provided, however, that the CEO or its designee may, in its sole discretion, extend the 30-month deadline if the CEO or its designee determines that extension of the deadline is warranted due to equitable considerations, due to Total Disability; or
2.
In the case of an individual claiming a disability as a consequence of active military service during a military leave of absence, within such longer period as may be authorized by the Chief Executive Officer. For purposes of this subsection C, "active military service" shall mean Active Military Service as defined in Section 6.20.080 of this Code.
D.
Medical Records and Medical Examination. The County may require such additional Evidence of Disability, as is deemed necessary, including copies of medical records and/or a medical examination at County expense to determine the existence, cause and extent of any injury or illness which may be the basis of a claim under the LTD Plan.
E.
Determination.
1.
If the Evidence of Disability shows to the satisfaction of the CEO that an Eligible Participant is Totally Disabled, the basic monthly benefit shall begin accruing on the first day following the expiration of the waiting period.
2.
Total Disability shall in all cases be determined by the CEO, except that any final decision of the Social Security Administration concerning a claim for disability benefits under the Federal Social Security Act, other than not being insured for disability benefits under that Act, shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties.
3.
If the CEO determines after medical examination that an Eligible Participant is not Totally Disabled, no disability benefits shall be payable.
F.
Appeal. A Participant may appeal, within the established time frames in the Election Information, the denial, cessation, or cancellation of benefits under the LTD Plan by filing written notice of appeal with the Claims Administrator, together with any pertinent supporting medical documentation. The Claims Administrator shall conduct a full and fair evaluation of the appeal and render a decision. In accordance with the procedures established for such purpose in the Election Information, the Claimant may file a written request for a hearing regarding a denial of benefits by the Claims Administrator. The matter shall then be reviewed by a hearing officer designated by the CEO. The hearing officer shall conduct a full and fair hearing and render a decision, which shall be final. If the employee's disability precludes submission of medical documentation within the established time frames, the deadline for the appeal may be extended by the CEO or his designee. Consideration of such extension by the CEO or his designee is contingent upon the provision of the medical documentation as soon as reasonably possible.

2.
All vacation time earned and credited to the books up through and including the Vacation Ending Date shall remain available for use or payoff at termination of County service pursuant to the rules set forth in Chapter 6.18; provided, however, that there shall be no limitations on the accrual and carryover of such time.

In the event a Participant is absent due to an industrial injury incurred on or after January 1, 1995, and the absence is charged to Nonelective Annual Leave, Elective Annual Leave, vacation, sick leave, accumulated holiday time or accumulated overtime, and the injury is subsequently determined to be compensable by the Chief Administrative Officer or the Workers Compensation Appeals Board, the Participant shall be entitled to a partial restoration of such time pursuant to the Election Information.
