Chapter 6.20 - LEAVE OF ABSENCE

6.20.010 - Definitions.
The following terms, when used in this Chapter 6.20 with initial capital letters, shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
A.
"Actual Work Day Hourly Rate" means the Semi-Monthly Pay Period Rate divided by the number of scheduled workday hours each pay period.
B.
"Calendar Hours" means the number of paid hours in a month for a monthly employee, based on eight hours per day times the number of days in the month. These hours are used for part-pay sick leave. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, Workday Hours will replace Calendar Hours for part-pay sick leave purposes.
C.
"Calendar-Day Hourly Rate" means the monthly pay rate, exclusive of flat monthly dollar amounts, pay period or hourly adjustments to pay provided for a class by this Title 6, divided by the number of calendar day hours in the month.
D.
"Current Sick Leave" means that sick-leave time which has been earned and accrued in the current calendar year.
E.
"Carryover Sick Leave" means that sick-leave time which was earned and accrued during the preceding calendar year or earlier.
F.
"Sick-Leave Accrual Rate" means the fractional number of sick-leave hours that are earned for each Qualifying Hour.
G.
"A Sick-Leave Day" equals eight work hours of sick leave for a 40-hour employee or 12 work hours for a 56-hour employee.
H.
"Sick Leave Maximum Hours" means the maximum number of sick-leave hours that can be earned and accrued each calendar year.
I.
"Sick Leave Pay Period Rate," effective with the pay period ending April 15, 2012 and upon notification to the board of supervisors by the chief executive officer that the human resources management system implementing this provision is fully operational, means the maximum number of sick leave hours and minutes an employee is entitled to each pay period apportioned according to the number of Qualifying Hours.
J.
"Sick Leave Years of Service" means the number of years of county service that an employee has acquired for sick-leave accrual purposes. For permanent employees, Sick Leave Years of Service are determined by taking the difference between the employee's continuous service date and the current date and then rounding down to the nearest full year. For recurrent and temporary employees, the Sick Leave Years of Service are determined by taking the difference between the latest hire date and the current date and rounding down to the nearest full year.
K.
"Workday Hours" means the number of paid hours in a month for a monthly employee, based on eight hours per day times the number of scheduled work days in the month.
(Ord. 2012-0017 § 34, 2012; Ord. 2010-0014, § 47, 2010; Ord. 93-0019 § 24, 1993.)
6.20.015 - Sick leave eligibility.
A.
Except as provided in this section and Sections 6.20.010 through 6.20.060, any employee shall be considered eligible for sick leave as provided hereby, and may utilize such sick leave when compelled to be absent because of disability resulting from sickness, injury, or pregnancy. Payments made pursuant to this section and Sections 6.20.010 through 6.20.060, except subsections A1 and A2, B and F of Section 6.20.030 and subsection C of Section 6.20.040, shall be made solely on account of disability resulting from sickness, injury or pregnancy.
B.
Employees not eligible for sick leave pursuant to the provisions of this section and Sections 6.20.010 through 6.20.060 include those employed on an hourly basis, employed for less than one-half time, employed as a county officer pursuant to Section 6.28.020, or those employed in positions listed in Section 6.28.060 of this code.
(Ord. 93-0019 § 25, 1993.)
6.20.020 - Accrual of full-pay sick leave.
A.
Effective March 1, 1993, for persons hired on or after July 1, 1986, and effective January 1, 1994, for persons hired before July 1, 1986, employees who are eligible for sick leave pursuant to Section 6.20.015 begin to accrue sick leave on a pay-period basis. At the beginning of each succeeding pay period, such employees shall accrue sick-leave hours based on the qualifying hours they have recorded during the preceding pay period. For each qualifying hour recorded in the preceding pay period, a fraction of an hour of sick leave is earned and accrued based on the appropriate Sick Leave Accrual Rate, and subject to Sick Leave Maximum Hours limitations applied each calendar year. The accumulation of sick leave hours towards the calendar year maximum begins each January 1st. When an employee has accrued the maximum number of hours, the employee will not be entitled to accrue any additional hours until the next January 1st, when accrual starts anew. Sick leave accrued in one pay period is available for use in the following pay period.
B.
The maximum hours of sick leave that an eligible employee represented by an employee representation unit shall earn and accrue during a calendar year is specifically designated by the board of supervisors based on the employee's class, and expressed as a number of days or hours of sick leave. Any qualifying part-time permanent employee employed on a monthly basis shall be allowed sick leave in a manner set forth in Chapter 6.20, but in an amount equal to the item sub fractional amount, as defined by Section 6.28.020. The hours corresponding to an authorized number of days shall be adjusted as necessary to reflect assignment to 56-hour workweeks. For 56-hour assignments, employees shall be entitled to earn 12 hours for every eight hours that a 40-hour employee shall be entitled to earn.
C.
The maximum hours of sick leave that an eligible employee who is not represented by an employee representation unit shall earn and accrue is 64 hours per calendar year, if assigned to a 40-hour workweek, or 96 hours per calendar year, if assigned to a 56-hour workweek.
D.
For employees assigned to a 40-hour workweek who are authorized to accrue 96 hours, or for employees assigned to a 56-hour shift who are authorized to accrue 144 hours, the maximum hours of sick leave that can be accrued each calendar year is also based on the employee's Sick Leave Years of Service, as reflected by the employee's continuous service date, or, for an employee without a continuous service date, the employee's latest hire date.
E.
On the anniversary of the date reflecting a change in the Sick Leave Years of Service as specified in Tables 4 and 5, below, additional hours of sick leave to which the employee is entitled as a result of the employee's length of service shall be applied during the remainder of the calendar year and renew at the beginning of the next calendar year.
F.

Effective with the pay period ending April 15, 2012 and upon notification to the board of supervisors by the chief executive officer that the human resources management system implementing this provision is fully operational, the Sick Leave Pay Period Rate shall be six hours and 32 minutes (6:32) per pay period.

H.
Except for the special, usage-only sick leave granted to certain employees on January 1, 1994, pursuant to Section 6.20.025 B, sick leave at full pay shall be deemed used in the reverse order in which it was earned; that is, the most recently earned sick leave time shall be used first.

On that day, the accrual by pay period as set forth in Section 6.20.020A begins for these employees, and employees will be credited with such additional sick leave, if any, they would have received based on the application of the relevant Sick-Leave Accrual Rate to qualifying hours as if the accrual began on January 1, 1993.
B.
For employees with a continuous service date earlier than July 1, 1986, who receive sick leave earnings in advance at the beginning of each year, the last such crediting shall be given on January 1, 1993.

In addition, on January 1, 1994, each of these employees shall be granted a number of hours of special full-pay sick leave on a one-time-only basis. The number of hours to be granted shall be equal to the Sick Leave Maximum Hours approved for the employee's class pursuant to subsections B or C of Section 6.20.020 as of January 1, 1994. The special sick leave granted on January 1, 1994 pursuant to this section is usage-only sick leave, and any of it which remains unused when the employee terminates county service shall not be eligible for payment pursuant to Section 6.20.030B. Further, this special sick leave may not be used until all other 100 percent Current Sick Leave, and all 100 percent Carryover Sick Leave, other than that accumulated prior to January 1, 1971, has been exhausted.

Injuries Occurring On or After January 1, 1981, Affecting Persons Not Covered by Section 4850 of the Labor Code. Any employee who is absent as a result of an industrial injury incurred on or after January 1, 1981, and deemed compensable by the director of personnel or the worker's compensation appeals board and who is not eligible for compensation under Section 4850 of the Labor Code, shall receive compensation pursuant to the following:
a.
To receive the difference between 70.0 percent of his base salary and the sum of the benefits prescribed by the worker's compensation laws of the state of California and earnings from other employment, when such earnings are less than 70.0 percent of his base salary. Employees shall be eligible to receive such compensation for a period of one year from the date of injury, but in no case shall such compensation be paid for a period of time in excess of the employee's continuous service immediately prior to such injury, except that any person employed on a daily recurrent basis as an Ocean Lifeguard (Item No. 2923E) or on an hourly recurrent basis as a Lake Lifeguard (Item No. 2953H) shall be entitled to receive the benefits set forth in this subsection C for a period not to exceed one year from the date of injury or a period equal to the employee's cumulative active service performed on or after July 1, 1985, whichever is less. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, 70.0 percent of base salary as described in this section shall be calculated at the Calendar-Day Hourly Rate.
b.
Crediting Previously Used Time. In the event an employee is absent due to an injury incurred on or after January 1, 1981, and the absence is charged to any previously earned vacation, sick leave, nonelective annual leave, accumulated holiday time or accumulated overtime, and subsequently the injury is determined to be compensable by the director of personnel or the worker's compensation appeals board, 70.0 percent of such vacation, sick leave, nonelective annual leave, holiday time, or overtime shall be restored to the employee. The remaining 30.0 percent shall be lost. Restorable time shall be calculated to the nearest 15-minute increment, and such restoration shall be deemed full recovery of any overpayment resulting from the operation of this paragraph.
c.
Once the injury is determined to be compensable, no employee may use any previously earned vacation, sick leave, nonelective annual leave, accumulated holiday time, or overtime to supplement the compensation provided in this section except as provided in subsections D1 and D2 below.
2.
Injuries Affecting Persons Covered by Section 4850 of the Labor Code. Persons employed in positions which are eligible for compensation under Section 4850 of the Labor Code shall, in lieu of the compensation set forth in subparagraph 1 above, be entitled to compensation as provided in said Section 4850. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, compensation described in this section C.2 shall be calculated at the Actual Work Day Hourly Rate.
D.
Compensation and Benefits—After One Year. An employee, who is compelled to be absent as the result of a compensable industrial injury after one year from the date of injury or a period equivalent to his continuous service immediately prior to said date of injury, whichever is less, or, if Section 4850 of the Labor Code applies, after the termination of the time covered by that section, may elect one of the following:
1.
To receive only those benefits provided under the worker's compensation laws of the state of California;
2.
To use any full-pay or part-pay sick leave to which he would be entitled pursuant to Sections 6.20.010 through 6.20.060 if his injuries had not arisen out of or in the course of his employment in order to receive the difference between his sick-leave pay and the sum of his worker's compensation benefits and earnings from other employment, when such sum is less than said sick-leave pay.
