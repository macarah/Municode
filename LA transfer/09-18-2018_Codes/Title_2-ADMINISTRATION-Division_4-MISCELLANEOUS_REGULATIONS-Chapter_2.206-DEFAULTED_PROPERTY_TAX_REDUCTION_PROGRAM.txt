Chapter 2.206 - DEFAULTED PROPERTY TAX REDUCTION PROGRAM

2.206.010 - Findings and declarations.
The Board of Supervisors finds that significant revenues are lost each year as a result of taxpayers who fail to pay their tax obligations on time. The delinquencies impose an economic burden upon the County and its taxpayers. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors establishes the goal of ensuring that individuals and businesses that benefit financially from contracts with the County fulfill their property tax obligation.
