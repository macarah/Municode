As part of the authorization process, the operator shall provide the local EMS agency with a quality assurance program that details the operator's plan for periodic reviews of both the computer mileage assisted calculations and the data entry process to insure that the patient is not overcharged. The local EMS agency will approve or reject use of a computer-based mileage calculation program within 30 days of receipt of a request for approval. All rates, including computer-based mileage charges, are to be computed from the time the ground ambulance arrives for hire until the ground ambulance is discharged by the patient or his or her authorized representative.

7.16.340 - Modification of Rates.
The maximum rates chargeable to the general public as set forth in Sections 7.16.280 and 7.16.310 of this chapter shall be adjusted effective July 1, 1992, and on July 1st of each year thereafter, to reflect changes in the value of the dollar. For each of the one year periods respectively beginning July 1, 1992 and July 1, 1993 such adjustments shall be made by multiplying the base amounts by the percentage change in the transportation portion of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Western Region, as compiled and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending with the last day of the prior month of February. Beginning July 1, 1994, and on each July 1 thereafter, such adjustments shall be determined by multiplying the base amounts by the average of the percentage changes of the transportation portion and of the medical portion of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Western Region, as compiled and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending with the last day of the prior month of February. The result so determined shall be rounded to the nearest $0.25 and added or subtracted, as appropriate, to the rate. Beginning July 1, 2017, and on every July 1, thereafter, such adjustments shall be determined by multiplying seventy-five (75) percent of the base amounts by the percentage change of the minimum wage change in Los Angeles County as defined in County Code Section 8.100.040 - Minimum Wage and by multiplying twenty-five (25) percent of the base amounts by the percentage change of the Medical Care line item of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Western Region, as compiled and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending with the last day of the prior month of February, except for the following charges: Registered Nurse/Respiratory Therapist per hour after the first three (3) hours adjustment shall be determined by multiplying the current charge by the percentage change of the minimum wage change in Los Angeles County as defined in County Code Section 8.100.040 - Minimum Wage; mileage adjustment shall be determined by multiplying the current charge by the percentage change of the transportation line item of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Western Region, as compiled and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending with the last day of the prior month of February; and Oxygen, Disposable Medical Supplies, and Ventilator adjustments shall be determined by multiplying the current charges by the percentage change of the Medical Care line item of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Western Region, as compiled and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending with the last day of the prior month of February. The result so determined shall be rounded to the nearest whole number and added or subtracted, as appropriate, to the rate. The Director of the Department of Health Services, or authorized designee, shall initiate implementation of these rate changes by notifying in writing each licensed private ambulance operator in Los Angeles County thereof, and any other individual or agency requesting such notification from the Director. Such notice shall be sent by first class mail no later than June 15 of the prior period.
