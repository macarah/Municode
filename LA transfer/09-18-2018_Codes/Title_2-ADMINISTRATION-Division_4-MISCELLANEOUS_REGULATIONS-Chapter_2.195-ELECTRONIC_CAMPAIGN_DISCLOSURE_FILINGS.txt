Chapter 2.195 - ELECTRONIC CAMPAIGN DISCLOSURE FILINGS

2.195.010 - Purpose.
The purpose of this Ordinance is to require candidates for Countywide office or supervisor, committees supporting or opposing those candidates, and committees supporting or opposing County ballot measures, to file certain campaign statements and reports electronically when certain dollar thresholds are met in order to facilitate expeditious access to these documents by the public.
(Ord. No. 2014-0025 § 1, 2014.)
2.195.020 - Findings.
A.
The Board of Supervisors finds that timely public access to campaign statements and reports regarding contributions and expenditures is vital to ensure the transparency and integrity of campaigns within Los Angeles County.
B.
Effective January 1, 2013, Government Code section 84615 authorizes local governments to require the online or electronic filing of campaign statements and reports, or other documents required to be filed pursuant to Chapter 4 of Title 9 of the Government Code (commencing with section 84100).
C.
The Board of Supervisors finds that reducing the filing of campaign statements and reports in paper format, and requiring online or electronic filing of the statements and reports required by this chapter will expedite the public's access to the information disclosed in campaign statements and reports, as well as conserve resources of County staff who must currently process the involved campaign statements and reports manually when filed in paper format.
D.
The Board of Supervisors finds that the County's online or electronic filing system will operate securely and effectively for this purpose and would not unduly burden filers.
