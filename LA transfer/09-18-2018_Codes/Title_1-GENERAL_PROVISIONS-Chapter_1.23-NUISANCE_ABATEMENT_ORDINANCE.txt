Chapter 1.23 - NUISANCE ABATEMENT ORDINANCE

The purpose of this chapter is to strengthen the existing regulations, processes, and remedies for the abatement of public nuisances on properties located in the unincorporated areas of the County of Los Angeles.

Such uses are hereby declared detrimental to the community's tranquility and security and shall be abated in accordance with this code, and any applicable constitutional and State law provisions.
