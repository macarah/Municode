Chapter 7.92 - ADULT BUSINESSES

7.92.010 - Purpose and application.
In order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the county of Los Angeles, this chapter is intended to regulate adult businesses which, unless closely regulated, have serious secondary effects on the community. These secondary effects include, but are not limited to, the following: depreciation of property values, increases in vacancy rates in residential and commercial areas, increases in incidences of criminal activity, increases in litter, noise, and vandalism and the interference with enjoyment of residential property in the vicinity of such businesses.
It is neither the intent nor the effect of this chapter to impose limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative material. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor the effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to materials of a sexually explicit nature, or to deny access by the distributors or exhibitors of such materials to their intended market.
It is the intent of this chapter to afford new adult businesses a reasonable opportunity to locate in a relevant real estate market.
Nothing in this chapter is intended to authorize, legalize or license the establishment, operation or maintenance of any business, building or use which violates any county ordinance or any statute of the state of California regarding public nuisances, unlawful or indecent exposure, sexual conduct, lewdness or obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof.
