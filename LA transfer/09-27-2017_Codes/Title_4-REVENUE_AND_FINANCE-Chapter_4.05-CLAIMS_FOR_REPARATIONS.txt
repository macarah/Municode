Chapter 4.05 - CLAIMS FOR REPARATIONS
Sections:

4.05.010 - Policy declaration.
The board of supervisors finds and declares the following:
A.
The dismissal of various county employees during the wartime years of World War II was based largely on fear and suspicion rather than on factual justification therefor.
B.
Various dismissals resulted directly from the administrative actions of this board and the county civil service commission, which separated county employees of Japanese ancestry from county service for the duration of World War II.
C.
It is fair and just that reparations should be made to those employees who were terminated from county service during the wartime years as a result of such administrative actions.
D.
To this end, the board of supervisors finds that equity and fairness will be served by authorizing the filing of claims with the county for salary losses suffered by the county employees directly affected, and authorizing the payment thereof, subject to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 82-0244 § 1 (part), 1982.)
4.05.020 - Eligibility for filing.
Any person who, due to the actions of the county of Los Angeles, was dismissed, terminated from a temporary position, rejected during their probationary period, or voluntarily resigned in lieu of dismissal from county service, and who incurred salary losses as a result thereof, is eligible to file a claim with the county for the reparation of those losses. Claims must be postmarked by May 15th of each year.
(Ord. 82-0244 § 1 (part), 1982.)
4.05.030 - Verification—Time period for losses.
The claim may be submitted for the reparation of the salary losses suffered during the years 1942 to 1947. The claim shall be supported by appropriate verification, such as the person's name at the time of the dismissal, the name of the employing department, a social security number, or by evidence of official action, such as a letter of termination.
(Ord. 82-0244 § 1 (part), 1982.)
4.05.040 - Filing with chief administrative office.
Claims shall be filed with the chief administrative office, which shall determine the eligibility of a claimant to receive reparations authorized by this chapter.

4.05.050 - Payments issued by warrant—Conditions and amount.
A claimant who is determined eligible by the chief administrative officer shall receive $1,250.00 each year for up to four years. All claims which the chief administrative officer determines are eligible for reparation shall be forwarded to the auditor-controller, who shall issue warrants in the appropriate amounts. In the event of the death of an eligible claimant, payment shall be made to the claimant's estate.
(Ord. 82-0244 § 1 (part), 1982.)
4.05.060 - Limitations on who may file.
No person other than a person who suffered a loss of salary as a result of county actions shall be eligible to file a claim pursuant to this act. No claim may be filed by the survivor of any such person. The death of a claimant prior to a claim shall terminate the claim.
