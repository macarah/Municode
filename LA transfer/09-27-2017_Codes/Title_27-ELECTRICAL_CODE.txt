Whenever it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of or perform any duty imposed by this Code or other applicable law, or whenever the Chief Electrical Inspector or an authorized representative has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or upon any premises any condition which makes such building or premises hazardous, unsafe or dangerous for any reasons specified in this Code or other similar law, the Chief Electrical Inspector or an authorized representative hereby is authorized to enter such property at any reasonable time and to inspect the same and perform any duty imposed upon the Chief Electrical Inspector by this Code or other applicable law; provided that:

The issuance of a permit based on plans and specifications shall not prevent the Chief Electrical Inspector from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans and specifications, or from preventing construction being carried on thereunder when in violation of this Code or of any other laws and ordinances.
