101.3 - Intent.
The purpose of this code is to establish the minimum requirements consistent with nationally recognized good practice for providing a reasonable level of life safety and property protection from the hazards of fire, explosion, or dangerous conditions in new and existing buildings, structures, and premises, and to provide a reasonable level of safety to firefighters and emergency responders during emergency operations. Consistent with this purpose, the provisions of this code are intended, and have always been intended, to confer a benefit on the community as a whole and are not intended to establish a duty of care toward any particular person.
This code shall not be construed to hold the County, the County of Los Angeles Consolidated Fire Protection District, or any officer, employee, or agent thereof responsible for any damage to persons or property by reason of any inspection authorized herein or by reason of the issuance or non-issuance of any permit authorized herein, and/or for any action or omission in connection with the application and/or enforcement of this code. By adopting the provisions of this code, the County, any district member city, or the County of Los Angeles Consolidated Fire Protection District, does not intend to impose on itself, its employees, or agents any mandatory duties of care toward persons and property within its jurisdiction so as to provide a basis of civil liability for damages. This section is declaratory of existing law and is not to be construed as suggesting that such was not the purpose and intent of previous code adoptions.
