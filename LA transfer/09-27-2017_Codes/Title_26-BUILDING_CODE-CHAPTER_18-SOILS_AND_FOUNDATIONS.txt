1809.12   Timber footings.
Timber footings shall be permitted for buildings of Type V construction and as otherwise approved by the Building Official. Such footings shall be treated in accordance with AWPA U1 (Commodity Specification A, Use Category 4B). Treated timbers are not required where placed entirely below permanent water level, or where used as capping for wood piles that project above the water level over submerged or marsh lands. The compressive stresses perpendicular to grain in untreated timber footings supported upon treated piles shall not exceed 70 percent of the allowable stresses for the species and grade of timber as specified in the AWC NDS. Timber footings shall not be used in structures assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E, or F.
(Ord. 2016-0053 § 35, 2016: Ord. 2013-0048 § 36, 2013: Ord. 2010-0053 § 44, 2010.)
