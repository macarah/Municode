If the county, city, or other public entity finds that the location or relocation of such facilities or improvements conflicts with the property or appurtenances laid, constructed, or maintained by the state franchise holder, whether such property was laid, constructed, or maintained before or after the facilities of the county or such city or other public entity were laid, the state franchise holder shall at no expense to the county, city, or public entity, on or before the date specified in a written request from the director of public works, which date shall not be less than thirty (30) days after the date of such notice and request to do so, commence work to change the location either permanently or temporarily of all property and appurtenances so conflicting with such improvements to a permanent or temporary location in such highways, to be approved by the director of public works; and thereafter diligently prosecute such work to completion.

If such highway be subsequently constituted a state highway, while it remains a state highway the rights of the state of California shall be as provided in section 680 of the California Streets and Highways Code.
