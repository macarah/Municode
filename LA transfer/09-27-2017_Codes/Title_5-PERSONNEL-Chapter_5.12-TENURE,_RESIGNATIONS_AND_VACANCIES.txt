Sections:

5.12.010 - Tenure of positions in classified service.
The tenure of position of any person in the classified service of the county shall not be affected by a change of personnel of the appointing officer, board, commission or body, and every person in the classified service of the county shall hold his or her position until such position becomes vacant as provided by Sections 5.12.050 through 5.12.090, or such person dies, resigns, retires or is discharged for cause pursuant to the Charter, civil service rules, or other ordinances.
(Ord. 7981 § 2 (part), 1961: Ord. 4099 Art. 3 § 47, 1942.)
5.12.020 - Resignation—Procedures and methods.
A county officer or employee resigns in any of the following ways:
A.
1.
A county officer or employee who without prior authorization is absent or fails to discharge is regularly assigned duties for either three consecutive regular working days or for two consecutive regularly scheduled on-duty shifts, whichever may be applicable, shall be deemed to have resigned effective as of the end of the day of which he last performed any of the duties of his position; provided, however, an officer or employee shall not be deemed to have so resigned if he resumes the performance of his regularly assigned duties at the commencement of his next regular working day or on-duty shift following the expiration of the aforementioned period of absence or failure to discharge duties.
2.
Within 20 calendar days after the effective date of such resignation, any officer or employee who has resigned pursuant to this subsection A may file with his appointing officer a written request for reinstatement. The appointing officer may reinstate such officer or employee if such appointing officer finds that there is good cause for the absence or failure to perform duties, such as bona fide illness, injury, or similar circumstances beyond the control of the officer or employee, and that such officer or employee is ready and able to resume the discharge of his duties. In the event an individual is so reinstated, such reinstatement shall constitute a retroactive leave of absence.
3.
This subsection A does not apply to an elective officer or department head.
B.
An elective officer or officer appointed by the board may resign by resignation in writing to the board and filed with the executive officer-clerk thereof. Such resignation shall be effective on the date designated therein.
C.
Any other officer or employee may resign by tendering his resignation in writing to his appointing officer. Such resignation shall be effective on the date designated therein, and if no date is so designated it shall be effective immediately.
(Ord. 9801 § 1, 1969: Ord. 4099 Art. 3 § 33, 1942.)
5.12.030 - Resignation—Notice required when.
When a county officer or employee, without prior authorization, is absent or fails to discharge his regularly assigned duties for such period of time that it appears likely he intends to resign pursuant to subsection A of Section 5.12.020, the appointing officer of such affected officer or employee shall service upon that officer or employee, either personally, by telegraph, or by first class mail addressed to the most recent address furnished to the appointed officer by the affected officer or employee, a notice in writing stating that failure of the officer or employee to resume the discharge of his duties on or before the commencement of the working day stated therein shall constitute such resignation. Said notice shall be posted, delivered personally, or delivered to the telegraph office at least 24 hours prior to the commencement of the working day specified in the notice. Failure to give such written notice shall not cause such resignation to be ineffective.
(Ord. 9801 § 2, 1969: Ord. 4099 Art. 3 § 33.1, 1942.)
5.12.040 - Resignation—Under fraud or duress—Request for hearing.
Nothing in Section 5.12.020 precludes any officer or employee from filing with the civil service commission, pursuant to its rules, a request for a hearing on the ground that his resignation made pursuant to Section 5.12.020 was obtained by the fraud, duress, or undue influence of the county.
