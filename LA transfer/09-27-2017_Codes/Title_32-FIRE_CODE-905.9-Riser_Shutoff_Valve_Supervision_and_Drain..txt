905.9 - Riser Shutoff Valve Supervision and Drain.
Each individual riser must be equipped with an indicating valve at its base and an approved valve for draining. Valves controlling water supplies shall be supervised in the open position so that a change in the normal position of the valve will generate a supervisory signal at the supervising station required by Section 903.4. Where a fire alarm system is provided, a signal shall also be transmitted to the control unit.
