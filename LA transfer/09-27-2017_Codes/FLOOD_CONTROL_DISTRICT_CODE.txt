C.
Each notice of administrative fine shall contain the following information:
1.
A statement that an administrative fine is being imposed on the responsible person(s) pursuant to this chapter;

Unless a responsible person requests an administrative hearing to contest the imposition of the administrative fine pursuant to Section 23.17, the notice of administrative fine shall constitute the final administrative order of the District with respect to said administrative fine, and the fine shall be due and payable by the responsible person(s) to the Chief Engineer within ten (10) calendar days following service of the notice of administrative fine.
E.
The enforcement officer shall serve a notice of administrative fine by either of the following methods:

2.
By first class mail, postage prepaid to the responsible person(s) at the address shown on the County's last equalized property tax assessment rolls (if any), and the last known address of the responsible person(s) (if any), and where the underlying violation pertains to the condition of real property, by posting the notice in a conspicuous place on the real property.
3.
Service under paragraph 1, above, shall be deemed effective at the time of personal delivery. Service under paragraph 2, above, shall be deemed effective five (5) calendar days following the date of mailing or, where the underlying violation pertains to the condition of real property, five (5) calendar days following the later of either the date of mailing or the date of posting.
F.
Payment of an administrative fine shall not excuse the responsible person(s) from correcting the violation when required by the enforcement officer.

(Ord. 2013-0034 § 3, 2013.)
23.17 - Request for Administrative Hearing/Hardship Waiver.
A.
Any responsible person served with a notice of administrative fine may request an administrative hearing before a hearing officer to contest the imposition and/or the amount of the administrative fine. The request must be made in writing and be filed with the Chief Engineer within ten (10) calendar days following service of the notice of administrative fine, and shall include a statement indicating the basis on which the responsible person(s) contests the imposition of the administrative fine, together with any evidence that the responsible person(s) want(s) the hearing officer to consider. The request shall also include the address of the responsible person(s) for the purpose of correspondence by the Chief Engineer and/or hearing officer.
B.
The written request for administrative hearing must be accompanied by a deposit equal to the full amount of the administrative fine as specified in the notice of administrative fine unless the responsible person(s) request(s) a hardship waiver pursuant to subsection C below. If no such waiver is requested, failure to deposit the amount of the fine concurrently with the request for administrative hearing shall constitute a waiver of the responsible person's entitlement to the administrative hearing. The hearing request and fine deposit shall be deemed filed on the date received by the Chief Engineer.
C.
A responsible person who requests an administrative hearing may also request a hardship waiver of the requirement to deposit the amount of the administrative fine prior to the administrative hearing. A hardship waiver request must be made in writing and filed with the Chief Engineer and must be accompanied by a sworn affidavit, together with supporting documents or materials, demonstrating the responsible person's financial inability to deposit the amount of the administrative fine. A hardship waiver request must be filed at the same time as the timely request for an administrative hearing.
D.
The Chief Engineer shall review any hardship waiver request and determine, in his or her sole discretion, whether or not to grant any such request and shall provide written notice by first class mail, postage prepaid, of his or her determination to the responsible person(s) at the address contained in the request for administrative hearing. If a request for hardship waiver is granted, the responsible person(s) shall not be required to deposit the amount of the fine prior to the administrative hearing. The granting of a hardship waiver shall not excuse the payment of the administrative fine upon a final determination that it is owed. If a request for hardship waiver is denied, the responsible person(s) shall deposit the amount of the administrative fine with the Chief Engineer within ten (10) calendar days following the date of the notice of the Chief Engineer's determination. Failure to make a timely deposit following the Chief Engineer's denial of a hardship waiver request shall constitute a waiver of the responsible person's entitlement to an administrative hearing.
E.
After receiving a timely hearing request and deposit or having acted on a timely request for a hardship waiver, pursuant to subsection D of this section, with respect to such deposit, the Chief Engineer shall schedule an administrative hearing. The responsible person(s) shall be given not less than ten (10) calendar days prior written notice by first class mail, postage prepaid, of the date, time, and place of the administrative hearing and the name of the hearing officer who will conduct the administrative hearing.
(Ord. 2013-0034 § 3, 2013.)
23.19 - Administrative Hearing Procedures.
A.
Hearings shall be conducted by the hearing officer on the date, time, and place specified in the notice provided for in Section 23.17. The hearing officer may, in his or her discretion, grant a continuance of the hearing date upon a request and a showing of good cause by the responsible person(s) or enforcement officer. The request must be made in writing and be received by the hearing officer at least two (2) business days prior to the hearing date. A copy of the continuance request must also be hand delivered to the enforcement officer if made by the responsible person(s), and to the responsible person(s) if made by the enforcement officer.
B.
At the hearing, the responsible person(s) shall have the opportunity to present evidence relevant to the hearing officer's determination of the matter. The failure of the responsible person(s) to appear at the administrative hearing shall constitute an abandonment of the hearing request and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies necessary to judicially challenge the imposition of the administrative fine. If the administrative hearing is abandoned, the Chief Engineer shall keep the funds deposited with the hearing request, unless a hardship waiver was granted, in which case the administrative fine shall be due and payable by the responsible person(s) to the Chief Engineer within ten (10) calendar days following the date that had been set for the administrative hearing.
C.
The notice of violation, notice of administrative fine, and any other reports prepared by or for the enforcement officer concerning the code violation, shall be accepted by the hearing officer as prima facie evidence of the code violation and the facts stated in those documents. The enforcement officer may attend the hearing, but is not required to do so. Once begun, the hearing officer may continue the hearing from time to time, in his or her sole discretion, to allow for the orderly completion thereof.
D.
After receiving all of the evidence submitted at the hearing, the hearing officer may further continue the hearing and request additional information from either the enforcement officer or the responsible person(s), or may close the hearing.
E.
After considering all the evidence and testimony submitted at the hearing and within ten (10) calendar days after the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision to either confirm or cancel the administrative fine or to reduce the amount of the administrative fine. The written decision shall include a statement of the reasons for the decision. The written decision shall be served by first-class mail, postage prepaid on the responsible person(s) and the enforcement officer. The hearing officer's written decision shall constitute the final administrative decision of the District.
F.
If the hearing officer confirms the imposition of the full amount of the administrative fine, the Chief Engineer shall keep the funds deposited with the hearing request, unless a hardship waiver was granted. If a hardship waiver was granted, the responsible person(s) shall pay the administrative fine to the Chief Engineer within twenty (20) calendar days following the date of the hearing officer's written decision.
G.
If the hearing officer reduces the administrative fine, the Chief Engineer shall refund the appropriate amount of the funds deposited with the hearing request to the responsible person(s) within twenty (20) calendar days from the date of the written decision, unless a hardship waiver was granted, in which case the responsible person(s) shall pay the reduced amount(s) to the Chief Engineer within twenty (20) calendar days following the date of the hearing officer's written decision.
H.
If the hearing officer cancels the administrative fine, the Chief Engineer shall refund the entire amount of the funds deposited with the hearing request to the responsible person(s) within twenty (20) calendar days from the date of the written decision, unless a hardship waiver was granted, in which case no further action is necessary.
(Ord. 2013-0034 § 3, 2013.)
23.21 - Right to Judicial Review of Final Administrative Decision to Impose Administrative Fines.
A.
A responsible person(s) may seek judicial review of the hearing officer's written decision pertaining to the imposition of an administrative fine by filing an appeal with the Superior Court in accordance with the time periods, procedures, and other requirements set forth in section 53069.4 of the California Government Code.
B.
If no appeal of the hearing officer's written decision is filed within the time period set forth in section 53069.4 of the California Government Code, the hearing officer's decision shall be deemed confirmed.
(Ord. 2013-0034 § 3, 2013.)
23.23 - Creation of Lien for Unpaid Administrative Fines.
A.
In addition to any other remedy provided by law, if an administrative fine is not paid within the time period provided for in this chapter, and the underlying violation pertains to the condition of real property owned in whole or in part by the responsible person(s), the amount of the unpaid administrative fine shall become a lien on that real property and the Chief Engineer may enforce and collect the unpaid administrative fine by recording a notice of lien against that real property in the office of the Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk.
B.
When a notice of lien has been recorded, and the full amount of the corresponding administrative fine is subsequently paid to the Chief Engineer, the Chief Engineer shall promptly record a notice of satisfaction of lien. Upon recordation of the notice of satisfaction of lien, the lien shall be cancelled.
