B.
Whenever a vessel is sunk in a county harbor, waterway or maritime facility, accidentally or otherwise, it shall be the duty of the owner of such vessel to mark it immediately by a buoy or beacon by day and by a lantern or light by night, and to maintain such markings until the sunken vessel or obstruction is removed; and the failure or negligence of such owner to do so shall be unlawful.

B.
The foregoing provisions of this section regarding seaworthiness shall not be applicable to the following:
1.
A vessel, whose mooring within the Marina del Rey Small Craft Harbor on the effective date of the ordinance adding this subsection to the code has been previously approved by the owner and operator of the marina in which the vessel is located, provided that this exemption shall expire 120 days following the effective date of the ordinance adding this subsection, and further provided that such exemption shall immediately lapse if such vessel is abandoned by its then current owner at any time following the effective date of the ordinance adding this subsection;
2.
A floating home, whose mooring within the Marina del Rey Small Craft Harbor on the effective date of the ordinance adding this subsection to the code has been previously approved by the owner and operator of the marina in which the floating home is located, provided the owner has registered the floating home as such with the harbor master within 120 days of the effective date of the ordinance adding this subsection, and further provided that such exemption shall expire if, at any time following the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the ordinance adding this subsection, ownership of the floating home is transferred and further provided that, the above notwithstanding, such exemption shall immediately lapse if the floating home is abandoned by its then current owner at any time following the effective date of the ordinance adding this subsection. Additionally, such exemption shall immediately lapse if any material alteration, enlargement or addition to a floating home is made. For purposes of this section "material alteration, enlargement or addition" means any construction, reconstruction, or other work of any sort which in any way increases any of the exterior dimensions, specifically including the overall height of the floating home, or which otherwise increases the enclosed habitable area by more than five percent of the existing habitable area as of the effective date of the ordinance adding this sentence to this subsection.* The repair or replacement of structural elements or other portions of the floating home with substantially equivalent materials shall not be considered a material alteration, enlargement or addition, nor shall the installation of any device, improvement or other item which is required to be installed solely by operation of any applicable law. For purposes of this section, a transfer in ownership of a floating home shall be deemed to have occurred if the owner sells, conveys or alienates the floating home, or any part thereof, or suffers his or her title, or any interest therein to be divested, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, or leases the floating home for a cumulative period of more than three years, including options to renew, or leases the floating home with an option to purchase, or in the event the owner of the floating home is a partnership, the interest of any general partner is assigned or transferred or his or her equity interest in the partnership is diluted in any manner whatsoever, or in the event the owner of the floating home is a corporation, more than 10 percent of the corporate stock thereof is sold, transferred or assigned, or in the event the owner of the floating home is a trust, there is a change of beneficial interest with respect to more than 10 percent of the floating home. However, notwithstanding the above, no change of ownership of a floating home shall be deemed to have occurred if a security interest in the floating home is conveyed in connection with the creation of a bona fide lien or other encumbrance on the floating home or if a joint tenant's interest in the floating home is transferred by devise, descent or by operation of law upon the death of that joint tenant;
3.
A vessel owned and operated by any agency of the federal government or a state, county or city;
4.
A vessel that is en route to or from its marina or dry storage area outside Marina del Rey and whose mooring within Marina del Rey does not exceed 90 days;
5.
A new vessel that has not yet been launched, rigged or equipped and is being held solely for sale by a broker/dealer who has previously been approved by the county to conduct such sales activities in the Marina del Rey Small Craft Harbor;
6.
A vessel that is less than 20 feet in overall length;
7.
A rowboat, canoe, kayak, and racing shell.
C.
In the event that proof of seaworthiness, as described in this chapter, of any vessel cannot be demonstrated to the harbor master at the time of any inspection, the harbor master shall issue a Notice to Comply which clearly identifies the area(s) in which the vessel is deemed to be unseaworthy and which further provides a compliance date by which the vessel's owner must return to the harbor master to demonstrate satisfactory correction of the deficiencies noted on the Notice to Comply. The harbor master and director shall establish within 90 days of the effective date of this ordinance, and publicly distribute, a set of guidelines which provides standardized compliance periods, to the extent feasible, to be provided for the correction of deficiencies that may be noted in any Notice to Comply as described herein. The harbor master shall provide the applicable time periods contained in such guidelines in any Notice to Comply unless the harbor master determines, in his discretion, that a longer time period should be provided for the particular vessel in question due to special circumstances.
D.
In the event that the owner of any vessel who receives a Notice to Comply from the harbor master disagrees with the compliance period provided in such Notice, the owner may seek review of the length of the compliance period by submitting the matter, within five working days, on a form approved by the director, to a seaworthiness compliance mediation committee for review.
1.
A seaworthiness compliance mediation committee shall be composed of five members who shall serve without compensation at the discretion of the director, four of whom shall have expertise in finances, boat repair or boating and one of whom shall be a small craft harbor commissioner.
2.
The seaworthiness compliance mediation committee shall convene as often as is necessary to review and resolve disputes regarding the length of the compliance period provided by the harbor master in a Notice to Comply issued pursuant to this section.
3.
The seaworthiness compliance mediation committee shall issue a written decision upon the conclusion of its review on each request presented to it setting forth the reasons for its decision and such decision shall be final.
4.
Any compliance period contained in a Notice to Comply shall be stayed during the time that a timely request for review regarding that Notice is pending before the seaworthiness compliance mediation committee.
5.
Failure of the owner of a vessel to demonstrate correction of any deficiency identified in a Notice to Comply issued to such owner within the compliance period contained in the Notice to Comply, as such period may be modified by a decision of the seaworthiness compliance mediation committee, shall be a violation of Part 6 of this chapter.
