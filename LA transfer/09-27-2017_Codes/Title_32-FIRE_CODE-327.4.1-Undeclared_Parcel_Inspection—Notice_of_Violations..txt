After a physical inspection, if the Fire Department determines that an undeclared parcel is not in compliance with the fire code, the owner will be given notice of such violation of the fire code. This notice of violation constitutes the first official notice. An owner's failure to comply with the first official notice constitutes the first violation of the fire code. After a first violation, a physical inspection of an undeclared parcel will be conducted by the Fire Department to determine compliance with the fire code. After the physical inspection, if the Fire Department determines that an undeclared parcel is not in compliance with the fire code, the owner will be given notice of the second violation of the fire code. This notice constitutes the second official notice to the owner. This second official notice shall also inform the owner that an administrative fine may be imposed on an undeclared parcel if not cleared. An owner's failure to comply with the second notice constitutes the second violation of the fire code.
