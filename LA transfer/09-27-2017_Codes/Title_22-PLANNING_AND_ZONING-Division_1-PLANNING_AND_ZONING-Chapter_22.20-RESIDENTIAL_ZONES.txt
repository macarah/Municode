Part 7 - RPD RESIDENTIAL PLANNED DEVELOPMENT ZONE
Sections:

22.20.460 - Uses and development standards.
Property in Zone RPD may be used for:
A.
Any use permitted in Zone R-1 under the same limitations and conditions, including auxiliary and transitional uses, front, side and rear yards, garages and carports, and area requirements, and those provisions of Part 2 of Chapter 22.52 which relate to Zone R-1.
B.
If a conditional use permit has first been obtained as provided in Part 1 of Chapter 22.56, property in Zone RPD may be used for a planned residential development, including a mobilehome park, subject to approval by the hearing officer, which will afford the same or lesser density of population or intensity of use than is specified in the zone.
—
It is the intent of planned residential development to promote residential amenities beyond those expected under conventional development, to achieve greater flexibility in design, to encourage well-planned neighborhoods through creative and imaginative planning as a unit, and to provide for appropriate use of land which is sufficiently unique in its physical characteristics or other circumstances to warrant special methods of development. In implementing planned development, it is further declared the purpose of this section to reduce developmental problems in hillside areas and to preserve areas of natural scenic beauty through the encouragement of integrated planning, integrated design and unified control of development.
—
Approval by the hearing officer shall be based upon findings that the plan compiles with the intent of planned residential development as set forth in this subsection B, provides as well or better for light and air, for public safety and convenience, the protection of property values and the preservation of the general welfare of the community, than if developed as provided in subsection A of this section, and shall be subject to all of the following provisions:
1.
Area. The proposed development plan shall include, as a condition of use, a parcel of land containing not less than five acres. A development plan may be considered on a parcel of land less than five acres in area when such property is in Zone RPD and has a common boundary with property which has been developed under an approved plan pursuant to this subsection B. In this case, the plan shall indicate that the proposed development will constitute an orderly extension in arrangement of buildings, facilities and open space throughout the combined parcels of land in addition to all the other requirements for approval of a conditional use permit.
2.
Density. When property in Zone RPD is developed pursuant to this subsection B, the number of units for each acre of the net area shall be equal to the number preceding the letter "U" in the suffix to the zoning symbol.
The provisions of Part 17 of Chapter 22.52 and Part 18 of Chapter 22.56, regarding housing permits for qualified projects, shall apply in Zone RPD.
3.
Type of Structures.
a.
Dwelling units may be in single-family detached, two-family or multiple residential structures, or they may be mobilehomes as defined in this Title 22 or factory-built houses as defined in the Health and Safety Code of the state, depending upon adjacent development and the compensating features of the development plan.
b.
The hearing officer may approve places of public assembly, recreational buildings and accessory buildings if for the primary use of persons residing within the planned development project and located so as not to be detrimental to adjacent properties. Distance between buildings shall not be less than 10 feet for one-story and two-story structures, plus two additional feet for each story above the second.
c.
The hearing officer, in considering placement and type of structures, may modify or require a greater depth for yards than would be required if developed as provided in subsection A. Provisions regarding yards and distances between buildings shall not apply to mobilehomes within mobilehome parks.
4.
Open Space. Open space shall comprise not less than 30 percent of the net area; provided however, that where the applicant submits evidence to the satisfaction of the hearing officer that the particular development will contain compensatory characteristics which will provide as well as better for planned unit development within the intent of this section, the hearing officer may modify said requirements.
—
Subject to the approval of the hearing officer, open space may include one or more of the following, designated for the use and enjoyment of all of the occupants of the planned residential development or appropriate phase thereof:
a.
Common open space developed for recreational purposes;
b.
Areas of scenic or natural beauty forming a portion of the proposed development;
c.
Present or future recreational areas of a noncommercial nature, including parks, playgrounds and beaches. Where specifically approved by the hearing officer, green fees or similar charges related to use of a golf course or similar open recreational use may be permitted, provided such charges are incidental to operation of said facilities, are not primarily commercial in nature, and do not alter the character of said recreational facility;
d.
Present or future hiking, riding or bicycle trails;
e.
Landscaped portions adjacent to streets or highways which are in excess of minimum required rights-of-way;
f.
Other similar areas determined appropriate by the hearing officer.
—
In approving said open space, the hearing officer shall give consideration to the project to be developed, the characteristics of such open space, the manner in which the open space is to be improved and maintained, and such other information as the hearing officer deems pertinent. Reservation of open space shall be made a condition of approval. Such reservation shall be by public dedication, establishment of a maintenance district, common ownership, or other satisfactory means to insure the permanent reservation of, and where appropriate perpetual maintenance of, required open space.
5.
Building Coverage. Buildings shall not occupy more than 50 percent of the net area, except that common recreational buildings are excluded from this building-coverage limitation.
6.
Parking. The provisions of Part 11 of Chapter 22.52 which specify the number and/or location of required parking spaces relating to dwelling units, places of public assembly and other recreational uses shall not apply when property in Zone RPD is developed pursuant to this subsection B. In granting a conditional use permit for a planned residential development, the hearing officer shall require automobile parking for such uses in an amount adequate to prevent traffic congestion and excessive onstreet parking; provided, however, in no event shall less than one covered parking space per dwelling unit, or less than 50 percent of the required number of parking spaces for public assembly or recreational uses specified in said Part 11 of Chapter 22.52 be permitted.
—
Where the hearing officer fails to specifically designate such parking requirements, the requirements of Part 11 of Chapter 22.52 shall be deemed to have been specified.
7.
Utilities. The applicant shall submit to the hearing officer, and it shall be made a condition of approval, satisfactory evidence that the applicant has made arrangements with the serving utilities to install underground all new facilities necessary to furnish service in the development. This requirement may be waived where it would cause undue hardship or constitute an unreasonable requirement.
8.
Development Schedule. The hearing officer shall approve a progress schedule indicating the development of open-space related to the construction of residential dwelling units, which shall become a condition of approval. Where development is to be completed in phases, the said development may, with the approval of the hearing officer, be coordinated between phases as approved in subdivision 11 of this subsection B. The hearing officer may modify, without a hearing, this condition pertaining to the development schedule based upon an affirmative showing, in writing, of hardship.
9.
Tentative Division of Land Map. A tentative map shall be filed when required by Title 21 of this code, Subdivisions. Where a tentative map is not required, a plot plan shall be filed indicating the precise location, width and type of improvements for private or public streets and pedestrian walks.
10.
Landscaping. A plan for landscaping all open areas, where appropriate, shall be submitted to and approved by the hearing officer.
11.
Distribution of Open Space. Planned development projects developed in phases shall be designated so that each successive phase will contain open space to independently qualify under the provisions of subdivision 4 of this subsection B; provided, however, that where the applicant submits development plans indicating to the satisfaction of the hearing officer that the proposed development will provide as well or better for planned unit development within the intent of this section, the hearing officer may approve a division of open space encompassing more than one phase.
—
Where a division of open space will encompass more than one phase, the applicant shall provide the hearing officer with a map indicating cumulative allocation and utilization of open space for each successive phase in each subsequent application.
12.
Division of Lots or Parcels. In addition to a tentative division of land map when required by Title 21 of this code, where lots or parcels of land are to be sold or separated in ownership from other property in the development, or applicable phase thereof, a map shall be submitted to the hearing officer, indicating the proposed boundaries of the lots or parcels of land to be sold or separated in ownership. Where the proposed division would create one or more lots or parcels of land having an area of less than that specified if developed as provided in subsection A of this section, said map shall also delineate the relationship between said lots or parcels of land and open space provided as required in subdivision 4 of this subsection B. The hearing officer shall consider the proposed separation in ownership and may approve such separation where, in the hearing officer's opinion, the proposed separation provides as well or better for planned development within the intent of this section.
13.
Sale or Separation of Lots or Parcels. Where lots or parcels of land are sold or otherwise separated in ownership, no dwelling unit or lot or parcel of land for a residential building shall be sold or encumbered separately from an undivided interest in the open-space appurtenant to such dwelling unit or lot or parcel of land where required by subdivision 4 of this subsection B. Such undivided interest shall include either:
a.
An undivided interest in the open space; or
b.
A share in the corporation, or voting membership in an association owning the open-space where approved as provided in subsection B4.
—
This provision shall not apply when said required open space has been accepted for public dedication; or where held in separate ownership with recreational rights to the required open space reserved to the lot owners and maintenance easements granted to an established maintenance district; or where other satisfactory means to insure permanent reservation of required open space have been approved by the hearing officer.
C.
