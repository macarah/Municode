The reporting party shall provide information to the chief relating to the ability of the responsible party to contain and dispose of the hazardous material, the estimated time it will take to complete containment and disposal, and the degree of hazard to persons and the environment. The chief may verify that the hazardous material is being contained and disposed of appropriately.
