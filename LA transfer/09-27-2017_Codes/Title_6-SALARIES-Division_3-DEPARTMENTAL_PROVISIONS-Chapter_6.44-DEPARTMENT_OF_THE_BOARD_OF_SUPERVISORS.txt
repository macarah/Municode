G.
The OIG is specifically authorized to monitor compliance with civil rights laws and to review inmate health information to determine compliance with such laws.
H.
Without interfering with the Sheriff's investigative functions, the OIG shall have the authority to undertake an inquiry and audit or perform monitoring at the request of the Board of Supervisors, the Commission, or the Sheriff, or on its own initiative. The OIG shall have the authority to investigate specific incidents involving Sheriff's Department personnel only in the following circumstances:
(1)
When requested by, or with authorization of, the Sheriff;
(2)
When the Inspector General makes a factually based determination that the Sheriff's Department has not adequately investigated an incident; provided, however, that the Inspector General shall first meet and confer with the Sheriff or his staff and afford the Sheriff's Department the opportunity to investigate the incident further before the OIG conducts an investigation pursuant to this subpart; or
(3)
When the Board of Supervisors makes a formal request to the Inspector General for privileged legal advice pertaining to a claim or lawsuit arising out of the actions of the Sheriff's Department or its personnel.
I.
The Inspector General shall serve as an agent of the Commission and the Board of Supervisors and shall make regular reports to the Commission and the Board of Supervisors on the Sheriff's Department's operations. Such reports to the Board of Supervisors shall be public reports, except to the extent they relate to confidential personnel or otherwise privileged matters or contain confidential inmate medical or mental health records or protected health information of inmates. The OIG shall work under the direction of the Inspector General, who shall be an attorney licensed by the State of California. The Inspector General shall serve as special counsel to the Board of Supervisors and have an attorney-client relationship with the Board of Supervisors when requested by the Board to provide privileged legal advice pertaining to a claim or lawsuit arising out of the actions of the Sheriff's Department or its personnel. The Inspector General shall also serve as special counsel to the Commission and have an attorney-client relationship with the Commission.
J.
The Sheriff's Department and all other County departments shall cooperate with the OIG and promptly supply any information or records requested by the OIG, including confidential peace officer personnel records, inmate medical and mental health records, and protected health information of inmates necessary for the OIG to carry out its duties; provided, however, that the OIG shall not have the authority to compel Sheriff's Department personnel involved in a specific incident to respond to questions concerning that incident without the authorization of the Sheriff. The OIG shall not make any use of a compelled statement or any evidence therefrom that would jeopardize a criminal investigation.
K.
The confidentiality of peace officer personnel records, inmate medical and mental health records, protected health information of inmates, and all other privileged or confidential information received by the OIG in connection with the discharge of the OIG's duties shall be safeguarded and maintained by the OIG as required by law or as necessary to maintain any applicable privileges or the confidentiality of the information. The OIG shall not disclose, without the Sheriff's authorization, any of the Sheriff's Department's confidential personnel, investigative, or disciplinary information unless such information is already a matter of public record. The sharing of information with the Board of Supervisors in response to a formal request by the Board of Supervisors for privileged legal advice pertaining to a claim or lawsuit arising out of the actions of the Sheriff's Department or its personnel is not a disclosure. The OIG shall not disclose any confidential inmate medical or mental health records or protected health information of inmates, unless the disclosure is permitted by law.
