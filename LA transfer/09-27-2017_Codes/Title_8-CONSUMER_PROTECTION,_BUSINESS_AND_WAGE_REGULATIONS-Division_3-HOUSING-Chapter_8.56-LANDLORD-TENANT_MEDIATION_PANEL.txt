Chapter 8.56 - LANDLORD-TENANT MEDIATION PANEL
Sections:

8.56.010 - Declaration of purpose.
The board finds that critical housing problems currently exist within the unincorporated area of Los Angeles County. With the advent of decontrol for rental units, numerous disputes have arisen between landlords and tenants of such units on the issues of rental increases and evictions. Based upon hearing held by the board and testimony presented, this board finds:
A.
That such disputes frequently may be resolved if there exists a formal means of communication and a dispute resolution mechanism;
B.
That harmony in the relationships between tenants and rental property owners is essential for the public health, safety and welfare;
C.
That public policy favors the resolution of disputes between these parties through voluntary agreement without resort to formal court proceedings; and
D.
That it is proper for the county to encourage and to participate in the resolution of such disputes between landlords and tenants.
