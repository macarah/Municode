The fees in this Section 4908.3 shall be reviewed each fire code revision cycle by the Fire Department. The amount of each fee shall be adjusted as follows: calculate the hourly rate for all positions included in the fee calculations based on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors-approved salaries and employee benefits, and Los Angeles County Auditor-Controller approved overhead rates. The adjusted fee shall be rounded to the nearest dollar; provided, however, notwithstanding any of the above, no fee shall exceed the cost of providing the service for which the fee is collected.
