DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 10-31. - Findings; public purpose.
(a)
Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida; and Chattanooga, Tennessee; and in reliance on studies by the City of Austin, Texas, and the City of Dallas, Texas, which experiences and studies are found by the board of commissioners to be similar to the problems faced by the county and in reliance on the determinations found by various courts of law, federal and state, of the effects of these establishments on the surrounding community and the community as a whole, the board of commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within the county. Moreover, it is the finding of the commission that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly in adult entertainment establishments, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with public nudity in adult entertainment establishments are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with public nudity and adult entertainment establishments are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the board of commissioners exercises its legislative authority in the limitation of nude conduct in adult entertainment establishments finding regulation is necessary, in the public welfare, and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with adult entertainment establishments.
(b)
The board of commissioners declares that the purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including but not limited to adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities and undesirable community conditions frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. The governing authority recognizes that it cannot legislatively abolish protected forms of expression. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments and the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
