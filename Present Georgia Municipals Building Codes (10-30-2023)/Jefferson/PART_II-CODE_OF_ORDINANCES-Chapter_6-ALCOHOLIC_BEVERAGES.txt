Sec. 6-15. - Types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
Based upon the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Gwinnett County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida; which experiences the city council believes are relevant to the problems faced by the city and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, the city council takes notice of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities.
(2)
Moreover, it is the finding of the city council that public nudity and seminudity, under certain circumstances, particular circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment," "adult entertainment" or "erotic entertainment" begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or seminude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or seminudity.
(b)
Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

(a)
The mayor and city council find that the regulation of certain amusement machines, namely gambling devices, in establishments that sell alcoholic beverages is in furtherance of the health, safety, and welfare on the inhabitants of the city. Further, the mayor and the city council find that such devices in these establishments lead to loitering, crowds, unruly behavior, and place demands on law enforcement, and have other adverse secondary effects and unintended consequences and that this regulation is the reasonable means to achieve the city's interests.

A finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that any tenant on the subject premises for which a license under this article is originally issued violated subsection (b) of this section shall create a rebuttable presumption that the licensee landlord failed to take reasonably appropriate measures under this subsection.
(d)
Upon a first violation of subsection (b) or (c) of this section, the licensee's license under this chapter shall be suspended for no less than three and no more than six months. Upon a second violation of this section, the licensee's license under this chapter shall be revoked.

(i)
The city clerk, in his discretion, may consider any extenuating circumstances that may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, the application, or the proposed location of the business. If, in his judgment, circumstances are such that the granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the general public, such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application.

(g)
No location which is licensed to sell alcoholic beverages on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall be denied continued operation under an existing license, or denied any renewal of such license, nor shall any new owner of said location be denied a new license based upon the measurements set forth in this section.
(h)
As to any location licensed in the future, if the distance requirements of this section are met at the time of issuance of any license, the subsequent opening and operation of a church or school within the distance prohibited herein shall not prevent the continuance of an existing license or the renewal thereof or the issuance of a new license to any subsequent owner of such property.

The following regulations shall apply to all establishments holding a license for consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises:
(1)
No person shall be employed to dispense, sell, serve, take orders, mix alcoholic beverages, or in any managerial position, by an establishment holding a license hereunder until such person has been fingerprinted or cleared by the chief of police or his designee, indicating that the person is eligible for such permit.
(2)
This section shall not be construed to include employees whose duties are limited solely to those of busboys, cooks, or dishwashers.
(3)
No permit shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the city police department, chief of police or his designee, and upon paying a fee, which shall be established by the city council, and a search of the criminal record of the person completed. Said application shall include, but shall not be limited to, the name, date of birth, and prior arrest record of the person though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only, and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order.
(4)
The chief of police or his designee shall have a complete and exhaustive search made relative to any police record of the person fingerprinted or cleared. In the event there is no record of a violation of this article, the chief of police or his designee shall issue a permit to the person, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the chief of police or his designee shall notify the person, in writing, that they are not eligible for employment, the case of such denial and their right to appeal.
(5)
No person shall be granted a pouring permit unless it appears to the satisfaction of the chief of police or his designee, that such person has not been convicted or plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal sale or possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, prostitution, solicitation or sodomy, or any sex related crime within a period of five years of the date of conviction and has been released from parole or probation. A person's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a county ordinance shall not, by itself, make a person ineligible for an alcohol pouring permit.
(6)
No person shall be granted a pouring permit who has been convicted, plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state, or local law for any felony within five years of the date of conviction and has not been released from parole or probation prior to the filing for application for such permit.
(7)
For purposes of this section, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which the defendant was allowed to avail themselves of the Georgia First Offender Act (O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.); except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentence in court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender.
(8)
An alcohol pouring permit shall not be issued for a period of one calendar year from the date of the original application. As noted in subsection (14) of this section, the alcohol pouring permit must be in the possession of the employee while the employee is working at the licensed establishment.

(9)
No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed, or covered up any material fact by any device, trick or scheme while making application to the police department for an alcoholic beverage pouring permit under this section.
(10)
If it is determined that a person is in violation of this section and a permit is denied for this reason, then 30 calendar days must elapse from date of notification per certified mailing before a new application and fee may be resubmitted.
(11)
All permits issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the chief of police or his designee, or the city clerk or his designee.
(12)
Replacement permits will be issued within 30 days of original date, upon paying one-half of the fee charged for alcohol pouring permits. After 30 days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted.
(13)
All permits issued hereunder remain the property of the city police department, and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the city police department or employee of the business license department.
(14)
No license shall allow any employee or manager required to hold a permit to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in his possession a current valid city pouring permit. For new employees, a receipt issued by the city police permit unit may be used for a maximum of 30 days from date of its issue. Licensees are required by this section to inspect and verify that each employee required to do so has in such employee's possession a valid current alcohol pouring permit.
(15)
It shall be the duty of all persons holding any license to sell alcoholic beverages to file with the chief of police or his designee, the name of the establishment, the license number and a list of all employees, with their home address and home telephone numbers twice annually; during the month of June and again during the month of December.

Sec. 6-155. - Open area and patio sales.
(a)
Alcoholic beverage sales can be made by a licensed consumption on-premises establishment in a patio/open area type environment if the establishment has been approved to do so via permit for a sidewalk café, whether on private or public property.
(b)
The requirement for approval is that the patio/open area be enclosed by some structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink within the licensee's knowledge; provided, however, the city manager may, as part of a permit for a sidewalk café issued in accordance with chapter 46 of the Code of Ordinances, authorize the patio/open area to be in front of the main entrance of the licensed premises, if an adequate alternative provision, such as an employee stationed at the entrance or video surveillance, is made to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink. Every authorized area where beer and/or wine is consumed outside shall be conspicuously posted at all times at each point of entrance/exit with signs stating the following: "The possession of alcoholic beverages beyond this point is prohibited." The letters of such signs shall not be less than three inches in height and one-half inch in width and shall be in black letters on a contrasting light background.
(c)
The height of such structure shall be a minimum of three and one-half feet above ground level. It does not have to be solid nor does it have to restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area. The structure must be permitted and approved by the city's building inspection department and the city's fire department as required by their governing regulations or codes.
(d)
Unless an adequate alternative provision is approved by the city manager as a part of a permit for a sidewalk café issued in accordance with chapter 46 of the code of ordinances, the only exit from this type area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises and through an approved fire exit (not for general public use unless an emergency exists). The fire exit should be of the type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists.
(e)
In the event that a licensee desires a patio/open sales area inside an existing structure, plans will be reviewed and approved on an individual basis by the building inspector. Interior-type patio/open sales areas must also meet the requirements of the city's development and fire codes.
(f)
Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit a hotel or motel with a consumption on the premises license from making such sales and allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages in ballrooms, meeting rooms, reception rooms, or patio areas of such hotel or motel; provided such functions are catered in connection with a meeting, conference, convention or similar type gathering at such hotel or motel. The term "patio areas," as that term is used in this subsection, does not have to conform to the standards in this section.
