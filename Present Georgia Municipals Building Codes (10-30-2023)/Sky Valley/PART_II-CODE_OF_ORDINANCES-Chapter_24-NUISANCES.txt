Sec. 24-62. - Failure to comply with order to repair or to demolish.
(a)
If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, structure, or property, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(b)
In addition, the placard shall bear the date posted, street address and number of the building involved and the signature of the director of the building inspection department. It shall thereafter be unlawful for any person to mutilate or remove such placard or for such building to be occupied until the required corrective action is taken.

Sec. 24-64. - Lien on property.
(a)
If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
(b)
The amount of the costs of repair or demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the city, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including but not limited to restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
(c)
In addition to the procedures and remedies in this article, the public officer may issue citations for violations of state minimum codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard and general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article.
(d)
Nothing is this article shall impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
