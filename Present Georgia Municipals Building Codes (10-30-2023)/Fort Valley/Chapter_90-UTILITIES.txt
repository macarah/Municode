Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 90-163. - Water resource districts established.
(a)
The city's water resource districts shall include the following:
(1)
Groundwater Recharge Area District.
(2)
Wetlands Protection District.
(b)
The boundaries of the water resource districts are shown on a set of maps designated as the "water resource districts," and are included as part of the city's official zoning map, which is on file in the county zoning administrator's office, located in the county courthouse.
(Ord. of 12-20-2001, § 2)
Sec. 90-164. - Groundwater recharge area district.
(a)
Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics, thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of the groundwater recharge area district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.
(c)
Delineation. The Groundwater Recharge Area District is delineated in accordance with the state department of natural resources' Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium or low, based on the state Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Such maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this division.
(d)
Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the groundwater recharge area protection district. Additional requirements for specific uses are as follows:
(1)
New above the ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements.
(2)
New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within a:
a.
High pollution susceptibility area;
b.
Medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15-acre-feet in size; and
c.
Low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet in size.
As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay, having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 by 10 -7 cm/sec (centimeters per second), or other criteria established by the National Resource and Conservation Service.
(3)
New homes served by septic tank/drainfield systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on table MT-1 of the department of human resources' (DHR) Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (referred to in this section as "DHR table MT-1"). The minimums set forth in DHR table MT-1 may be increased further, based on consideration of other factors set forth in sections A through F of the DHR manual.
a.
150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated, based on application of DHR table MT-1, if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area;
b.
125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated, based on application of DHR table MT-1, if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area;
c.
110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated, based on application of DHR table MT-1, if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area.
(4)
New manufactured home parks served by septic tank/drainfield systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on table MT-2 of the department of human resources' (DHR) Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (referred to in this section as "DHR table MT-2").

Section A. The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (3- or 4-bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc., are proposed for construction or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the Peach County Board of Health will require larger lots to assure usable soil area.
Section B. The Peach County Board of Health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features.
Section C. Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively.
Section D. The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors.
Section E. There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent county zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met.
Section F. The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by nonpublic or an individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by a public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine the square footage of the lot needed, X, use the following formula:
  EXPAND
X = 5,000 gal/day 1,200 gal/acre/day
1,200 gal/acre/day
= 4.17 acres
= 4.17 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre
= 181,500 ft 2 area of land needed
  Likewise, for a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine the square footage of the lot needed, Y, for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula:
EXPAND
Y =  5,000 gal/day
600 gal/acre/day
= 8.33 acres
= 8.33 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre
= 363,000 ft 2 area of land needed
  (Ord. of 12-20-2001, § 4)
Sec. 90-165. - Wetlands protection district.
(a)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature, and provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study; and recreational opportunities.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of the wetlands protection district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas.
(c)
Delineation.
(1)
The wetlands protection district is hereby established, which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. Such map shall be referred to as the "generalized wetlands map" and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this division, together with all explanatory matter on, and attached to, such map.
(2)
The generalized wetlands map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this section does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(d)
Wetland development permit requirements.

DIVISION 3. - BACKFLOW AND CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL

Sec. 90-191. - Purpose.
The purpose of this division is to protect the public potable water supply of the city from contamination or pollution by isolating within the customer's internal distribution system or private water system such contaminants or pollutants as would backflow into the public water system and promote the elimination or control of existing cross connections, actual or potential, between the customer's inplant potable water system and nonpotable water systems or plumbing fixtures and the public water system.
(Code 1982, § 13-91)
Sec. 90-192. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Auxiliary water supply means any water supply on, or available to, the premises, other than the purveyor's approved public water supply, and may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or from any natural source, or used water or industrial fluids. Such waters may be contaminated, polluted or objectionable, and may include an unacceptable water source over which the utilities commission does not have sanitary control.
Backflow, cross connection and backflow preventer mean the same as defined in the Standard Plumbing Code.
Contained cross connection means a connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow preventer at the water service connection to any customer's premises, where it is physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross connections within the customer's water system, or where an approved backflow preventer is installed on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer's water system in which there are actual or potential cross connections that cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of cross connection.
Contamination means an impairment of the quality of potable water by sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials, to a degree which creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health through poisoning or the spread of disease.
Controlled cross connection means a connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow preventer, properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.
Director means the director of utilities for the city, who is vested with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross connection control and containment program, and for the enforcement of the provisions of this division.
Hazard means a potential risk to public health adversely affecting the potable water system.
Hazard to the public water system means an actual or potential threat of severe damage to physical property of the public potable water system or the consumer's potable water system, or of pollution or contamination which would have a protracted effect on the quality of potable water in the system.
Health hazard means any condition, device or practice in the water supply system or the operation thereof which creates or, in the judgment of the director, may create, a danger to the health and well-being of water consumers.
Industrial fluids system means any system containing a fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration constituting a health, system, pollutional or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water supply, including, but not limited to, the following:

Plumbing hazard means a plumbing type cross connection in a consumer's potable water system which has not been properly protected by an approved airgap or approved backflow preventer.
Pollutional hazard means an actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the water system or to the potability of the public's or the consumer's potable water system which constitutes a nuisance, or is aesthetically objectionable, or could cause damage to the system or its appurtenances, but is not dangerous to health.
Used water means any water supplied by the utility commission to a consumer's water system, which has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the utility commission.
Water service connection means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system, i.e., the point at which the utility commission loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water upon delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection includes the downstream end of the meter.
Water system means the utility system and the customer system.
(1)
Customer system means the parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the distribution system, which are utilized in conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use.

In the case of any premises on which there are uncontrolled cross connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved airgap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer installed at the service connection.
(5)
In the case of any premises on which, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete inplant cross connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer installed on each service to the premises.
(6)
In the case of any premises on which there is no known pollutional or contaminant hazard, the public water system shall be protected by an approved residential dual check valve installed at the service connection.
(f)
Any backflow preventer required in this section shall be a model and size approved by the director and manufactured in full conformity with the standards established in the latest edition of the Standard Plumbing Code.
(g)
If, in the judgment of the director, an approved backflow preventer, other than a residential dual check type backflow preventer, should be installed at the customer's water service connection for the safety of the customer's water system, the director shall give notice, in writing, to such customer to install the necessary backflow preventer at a specific location on his premises. The customer shall immediately install such device at his own expense, and failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install, have tested and maintain such device shall constitute a ground for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met. Turn-off and turn-on fees must be paid by the customer prior to restoration of service.
(h)
It shall be the duty of the customer at any premises where backflow preventers, other than the residential dual check valve, are installed, to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once each year or at more frequent intervals as required by the director. Such inspections and tests shall be made at the expense of the customer, and shall be performed in a timely manner by a certified tester approved by the director. The customer shall be notified by the director in advance when the tests are to be undertaken, and may witness the tests, if so desired. Any device found to be defective shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense of the customer. Records of such tests, repairs and overhauls shall be kept by the customer and made available to the director. Residential dual check valves installed by the utility commission will be maintained by the utility commission, at its expense.
(i)
Any backflow preventer installed before the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived which does not meet the requirements of this section, but which was an approved device for the purposes described in this section at the time of installation, and which has been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection (h) of this section, be excluded from the requirements of this division if the director determines that it will adequately protect the utility system. Whenever such an existing device is moved from its location, or requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the director finds that the maintenance thereof constitutes a health hazard, such device shall be replaced by an approved backflow preventer.
(j)
Residential dual check type backflow preventers shall be installed at the discretion of the director on new and existing services, and the customers shall pay all applicable fees for such devices.

(c)
General criteria.
(1)
Installation requirements for new food service facilities. All proposed or newly remodeled food service facilities inside the city utility commission wastewater service area shall be required to install an approved, properly operated and maintained grease interceptor. All interceptor units shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility building unless the user can demonstrate to the city utility commission that an outdoor interceptor would not be feasible. All interceptor units shall be of the type and capacity approved by the city utility commission.
(2)
Requirements for existing food service facilities. All existing food service facilities inside the city utility commission wastewater service area are expected to conduct their operations in such a manner that grease is captured on the user's premises and then properly disposed. Existing food service facilities will be handled under the city utility commission's grease management program in the following manner:
a.
The city utility commission will periodically inspect each food service facility on an as-needed basis to assure that each facility is complying with the intent of the grease control program. The as-needed inspection shall be determined by the city utility commission.
b.
Each food service facility in the vicinity of any problem areas will be inspected. The facilities' grease control practices and the adequacy of their grease control interceptor/equipment will be assessed. Maintenance records will also be reviewed.
c.
Following the inspections, the city utility commission will send written notice to the inspected food service facilities, containing a summary of the policy requirements, and the results of the inspection. The inspections will typically result in one of the following actions:
1.
Facilities equipped with an appropriate and adequately sized grease interceptor who are meeting the intent of the grease management program through effective grease control practices will be commended for their compliance.
2.
After notice and an opportunity to be heard, facilities not in compliance shall be required to develop and submit to the city utility commission a proposed plan designed to achieve compliance through improved housekeeping and/or increased maintenance and pumping of the existing grease interceptor/equipment.
3.
Facilities that are not successful in achieving compliance with the intent of the grease management program through improved housekeeping and increased maintenance and pumping of the existing grease interceptor/equipment will be required to install the necessary interceptor/equipment to bring the facility into compliance.
(3)
Prohibited discharges. Domestic wastewater shall not be discharged to the grease interceptor unless specifically approved, in writing, by the city utility commission.
(4)
Floor drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease interceptor.
(5)
Location. Each grease interceptor shall be installed and connected so that it is easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at anytime. Grease interceptors required under this article shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility. The best location is in an area outside of an exterior wall, but upstream from the domestic wastewater drain lines. A grease interceptor may not be installed inside any part of a building unless approved in writing by the city utility commission. The user bears the burden of demonstrating that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible.
(d)
Design criteria.
(1)
Construction of interceptors. Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the city plumbing standards and outdoor units shall have a minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All alternative grease removal devices or technologies shall be subject to the written approval of the city utility commission. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed technology.
(2)
Access. Outdoor grease interceptors shall be provided with two manholes terminating 1-inch above finished grade with cast iron frame and cover. All grease interceptors shall be designed and installed to allow for complete access for inspection and maintenance of inner chambers as well as viewing and sampling of wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer.
(3)
Load-bearing capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may exist, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing capacity (example: vehicular traffic in parking or driving areas).
(4)
Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to the grease interceptor shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the interceptor. The inlet pipe bottom tee branch shall extend one foot below liquid level. The outlet pipe bottom tee branch shall be submerged to two-thirds of the liquid depth. Each grease interceptor shall have only one inlet and one outlet pipe.
(5)
Interceptor sizing.
a.
Outdoor grease interceptors shall not have a capacity of less than 1,500 gallons nor exceed a capacity of 3,000 gallons. No matter what the calculated capacity using the following formulas, the minimum interceptor size shall be 1,500 gallons. If the calculated capacity using one of the following formulas exceeds 3,000 gallons, then multiple units in series shall be installed. The size of a grease interceptor shall be approximated by the following methods and grease interceptor size shall be the larger of the two results.
1.
Interceptor capacity (gallons) = (S) × (25) × (Hr/12).
S = Number of Seats
Hr = Maximum hours of daily operation
(Include preparation & clean up)
2.
Interceptor capacity (gallons) = (Sum of fixture flows) × (20).

  c.
Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and shall pay the costs to provide additional measures if required by the city utility commission. The city utility commission reserves the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease discharge, or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the formula.
(e)
Grease interceptor maintenance.
(1)
Pumping. All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is strictly prohibited.
(2)
Pumping frequency. Outdoor grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three months. Under-sink or in-line grease interceptors must be pumped/cleaned out completely a minimum of once every month. Grease interceptors may need to be pumped more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer collection system. Pumping frequency may be extended past the minimum period if it can be demonstrated by the user and approved by the city utility commission.
(3)
Pump out order. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed the city utility commission's maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 33 percent of the total depth of the trap, the city utility commission will issue a pump out order to the user. The user shall have seven days from receipt of the order to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written or verbal warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply.
(4)
Disposal of interceptor pumped material. All waste removed from each grease interceptor shall be recorded on a proper manifest form. Also, all waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed at a facility approved by the city utility commission to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumped material be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer collection system.
(5)
Additives. Any additives placed into the grease interceptor or building discharge line system on a constant, regular, or scheduled basis shall be reported to the city utility commission. Such additives shall include, but are not be limited to, commercially available bacteria or other additives designed to absorb, consume, or treat fats, oils, and grease. The use of additives shall in no way be considered as an alternative technology or a substitution for maintenance procedures required herein.
(6)
Chemical treatment. Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, enzymes, acids, and other chemicals designed to dissolve, purge, or remove grease shall not be allowed to enter the grease interceptor.
(f)
Administrative requirements.
(1)
