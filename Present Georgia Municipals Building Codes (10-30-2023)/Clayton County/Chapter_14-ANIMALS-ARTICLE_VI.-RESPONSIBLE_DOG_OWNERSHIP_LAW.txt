A sign must be plainly visible and readable to anyone approaching the premises from a sidewalk, driveway, walkway or other byway upon which a person would normally approach the premises.
(f)
Any vicious dog not under control as provided in this section is declared a public nuisance and it may be impounded by the county's animal control unit.

Upon determination of such a finding, the court may declare the dog a nuisance.
(b)
Said determination is civil in nature. The county shall serve notice of the hearing by statutory overnight delivery or certified mail to the last known address of the dog owner or other person who was last known to be in control of the dog, if the owner is not known.

Once a vicious dog has been found to be a nuisance by the magistrate court, the court may order the dog destroyed in the usual and customary manner by the county's animal control unit, or order such other remedy which the court finds will protect the public from harm.

If the dog has been removed from the county before the registration fee comes due, the fee shall be imposed and become immediately payable once the dog returns to the county; however, only one annual registration fee shall be required for any 12-month period.
(b)
If the registration fee has not been paid as required by this section, nonpayment of the registration fee shall be a misdemeanor and shall be punishable under section 1-12 of this Code.
