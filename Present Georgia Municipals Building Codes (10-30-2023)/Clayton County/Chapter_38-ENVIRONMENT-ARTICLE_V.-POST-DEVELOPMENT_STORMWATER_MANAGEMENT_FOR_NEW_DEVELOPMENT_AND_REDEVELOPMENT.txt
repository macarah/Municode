ARTICLE V. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT

Sec. 38-110. - Findings.
It is hereby determined that:
Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;
Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits;
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution;
Therefore, Clayton County Board of Commissioners has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff.

"Stormwater runoff" means the flow on the surface of the ground, resulting from precipitation.
Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway.
Other terms used but not defined in this article shall be interpreted based on how such terms are defined and used in the GSMM and Clayton County's MS4 permit.

(Ord. No. 2020-235, § 1, 12-1-20)
Sec. 38-114.3. - Better site design practices for stormwater management.
Stormwater management plans shall preserve the natural drainage and natural treatment systems and reduce the generation of additional stormwater runoff and pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. Additional details can be found in the GSMM Section 2.3.
(Ord. No. 2020-235, § 1, 12-1-20)
Sec. 38-114.4. - Stormwater runoff quality/reduction.
Stormwater runoff quality/reduction shall be provided by using the following:
(1)
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted before December 10, 2020, the applicant may choose either (i) runoff reduction or (ii) water quality.
(2)
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted on or after December 10, 2020, the applicant shall choose (i) runoff reduction and additional water quality shall not be required. To the extent (i) runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy, then (ii) water quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
a.
Runoff reduction - The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first 1.0 inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
b.
Water quality - The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event.
(3)
If a site is determined to be a hotspot, Clayton County Water Authority may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
(Ord. No. 2020-235, § 1, 12-1-20)
Sec. 38-114.5. - Stream channel protection.
Stream channel protection shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:

Erosion prevention measures, such as energy dissipation and velocity control; and
(3)
Preservation of any applicable stream buffer.
(Ord. No. 2020-235, § 1, 12-1-20)

Sec. 38-114.7. - Extreme flood protection.
Extreme flood protection shall be provided by controlling the 100-year, 24-hour storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(Ord. No. 2020-235, § 1, 12-1-20)
Sec. 38-114.8. - Downstream analysis.
Due to peak flow timing and runoff volume effects, some structural components of the stormwater management system fail to reduce discharge peaks to pre-development levels downstream from the site. A downstream peak flow analysis shall be provided to the point in the watershed downstream of the site or the stormwater management system where the area of the site comprises ten percent of the total drainage area in accordance with Section 3.1.9 of the GSMM. This is to help ensure that there are minimal downstream impacts from development on the site. The downstream analysis may result in the need to resize structural components of the stormwater management system.
(Ord. No. 2020-235, § 1, 12-1-20)
Sec. 38-114.9. - Stormwater management system inspection and maintenance.
The components of the stormwater management system that will not be dedicated to and accepted by Clayton County Water Authority, including all drainage facilities, best management practices, credited conservation spaces, and conveyance systems, shall have an inspection and maintenance agreement to ensure that they continue to function as designed. All new development and redevelopment sites are to prepare a comprehensive inspection and maintenance agreement for the on-site stormwater management system.
