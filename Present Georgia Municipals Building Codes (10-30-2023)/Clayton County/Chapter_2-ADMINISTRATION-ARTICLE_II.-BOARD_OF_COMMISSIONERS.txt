Section 2-35-01. Agenda. The clerk of the board of commissioners, or his or her designee in the absence of the clerk, shall prepare an agenda for each regular and called meeting of the board. The regular monthly meetings shall consist of two business meetings.
(a)
Preparation of the agenda for regular meetings. Any commissioner wishing to place an item on the agenda may do so and should submit a resolution or ordinance approved by the county attorney, or a memorandum with any supporting documents to the clerk, or his or her designee in the absence of the clerk, by the close of business on the Wednesday before the next meeting. Items submitted after that time will be placed on the agenda for the meeting immediately following the next meeting.
(b)
Department heads wishing to place an item on the agenda. Any department head may submit an item to the chief operating officer for consideration as an agenda item. Such items shall be reviewed by the chief operating officer to ensure that the item is consistent with the policies and direction of the board of commissioners, and that any required budgetary impact is reviewed and approved by the chief financial officer. Such items shall also be reviewed and approved by the staff attorney's office, except for budget items submitted by the finance department. If approved, the chief operating officer will notify the clerk, or his or her designee in the absence of the clerk, and supply supporting documents by close of business on the Wednesday before the next meeting. Items submitted after that time will be placed on the agenda for the meeting immediately following the next meeting.
(c)
Preparation and publication of the agenda. The clerk, or his or her designee in the absence of the clerk, shall prepare the agenda by the close of business on the Thursday preceding the meeting. Nothing further can be placed on the agenda after Thursday. The agenda shall be published to the full board and the public by close of business on the Friday before the meeting.
(d)
Adding items to the agenda during a meeting. Adding during the meeting is disfavored and should only occur for urgent business matters that need to be addressed at that meeting. Adding an item requires three affirmative votes. A motion must be made, seconded and carried to add each item to the agenda.
(e)
Removing an item from the agenda prior to adoption. After the meeting has been called to order and before the agenda is adopted, any commissioner may call for its removal. If the chair hears no objection, the item is removed. If an objection is heard, the chair will treat the commissioner's call for removal of the agenda item as a main motion and call for debate. After the item is debated, the chair will call for a second and if seconded the chair will call for a vote. Three affirmative votes are required to remove an item after an objection.
(f)
Changes to an adopted agenda. Once the agenda is adopted, items can only be added if the subject matter is so urgent that immediate action of the board is required in the best interest of the public.
(g)
Consent agenda. The board of commissioners will use a consent agenda which lists items of routine nature such as renewal of grants, refund request, and other similar matters. Any items of business that are expected to receive unanimous approval and for which debate is not expected, should be placed on the consent agenda. Items may be removed from the consent agenda to the regular agenda for further discussion by any commissioner upon a motion, without a need for a second to the motion. The consent agenda is adopted with one motion.
(h)
Agendas for other meetings of the board. Agendas for other meetings of the board sitting as the zoning board or otherwise, shall be prepared in a like manner with the last date for adding items to the agenda to be four working days prior to the call of the meeting. The clerk, or his or her designee in the absence of the clerk, is to finalize and publish the agenda no less than 72 hours prior to the call of the meeting.
Section. 2-35-02 Presiding officer.
(a)
The chairman of the board of commissioners, or in his absence the vice-chair, shall be the presiding officer at all meetings of the board of commissioners.
(b)
The presiding officer is responsible for the orderly conduct of the meeting. In order to ensure a fair, orderly and efficient meeting, the chair must enforce the meeting procedures adopted by the board of commissioners.
(c)
The presiding officer shall rely on the county attorney for guidance on these meeting procedures and any other parliamentary issues.
(d)
By virtue of his or her election to the board of commissioners, the presiding officer shall retain the right to debate any matter that comes before the board and to vote on any such matter.
Section 2-35-03. Minutes. The clerk, or her or her designee in the absence of the clerk, is responsible for recording the minutes of the meeting. The minutes shall not be a verbatim transcript of the meeting. The minutes shall follow the agenda. The minutes shall include the names of the commissioners present at the meeting, a description of each proposal or motion made, and a record of all votes. If the meeting was called with less than 24 hours notice, the minutes must reflect the reason or special circumstance that lead to holding the meeting with less than 24 hours notice. If the board goes into executive session, the minutes must record the vote and reason for the executive session. Also, an affidavit from the presiding officer certifying that the executive session was limited to exempt topics must be attached to the minutes. Minutes will not be kept of an executive session, except for meetings convened to discuss the accusation of real property where minutes must be made but will remain confidential until the property in question is purchased or abandoned. Public comment will be noted but not transcribed.
Section 2-35-04. Quorum. Upon call to order by the presiding officer, the presence of at least three commissioners, including the presiding officer, constitutes a quorum and all business on the agenda can be handled.
Section 2-35-05. Public comment.
(a)
(1)
The board welcomes public comment; however, to manage available time, public comment will be limited to two minutes per speaker at each regular business meeting of the board of commissioners, however, in no event shall the public comment period last longer than 20 minutes at any single meeting. All public comments must be limited to matters on the agenda or over matters which the governing body has jurisdiction.
(2)
Speakers must maintain a decorous demeanor and refrain from personal attacks upon members of the governing body, shouting and using obscene language. Comments which are redundant or repetitive from previous statements made in the same meeting may be ruled out of order and terminated by the presiding officer. The presiding officer may interrupt and take the floor away from individuals who violate this subsection.
(3)
At the end of the 20-minute public comment period, if any member of the public who has signed up to speak has not been reached, that person shall have the right to be carried forward to the next regular business meeting of the board and shall be placed at the top of the list at that meeting. Any member of the public wishing to make comment must sign up with the clerk prior to the call of the meeting.
(4)
Public comment shall occur at the regular meetings of the board immediately preceding executive session.
(b)
Notwithstanding the time limitations set forth in subsection (a) above, applicants or citizens may also speak for or against an item that is considered by law to be a zoning decision and each side will have ten minutes to present its case. The board of commissioners may, upon majority vote, allot more time for each side to present its case. The clerk, or his or her designee in the absence of the clerk, shall be responsible for keeping time. In the event there is more than one speaker per side, speakers must divide their time in order to complete their full presentation within the ten-minute time allotment. When the buzzer sounds to indicate that time has run out, the speaker will be expected to immediately cease speaking and to leave the podium area. Prior to speaking on a zoning issue, speakers must complete a speaker card and present it when approaching the podium. If a speaker has physical (non-electronic) documents for the commissioners, the speaker shall provide eight copies when approaching the podium. Five copies are for the commissioners and the remaining copies are for the zoning administrator, the county attorney and the clerk, or his or her designee in the absence of the clerk. Applicants or citizens speaking in favor of an item shall speak first and applicants in zoning ordinance cases shall have the right to reserve time for rebuttal. Opponents of a zoning decision item shall have no right of rebuttal. Once the speakers have finished speaking, staff shall make a recommendation for action to the commission. At this point, speakers are no longer allowed to speak unless called to the podium by an individual commissioner to answer questions or provide information. When speaking, speakers shall talk directly into the microphone and begin by stating their name, address and the name of any organization they represent. Abusive, profane or derogatory language will not be permitted. Holding up signs, clapping and yelling to show support for or opposition to a speaker will not be permitted, but a show of hands or quietly standing will be permitted to show support for or opposition to a speaker's position.
