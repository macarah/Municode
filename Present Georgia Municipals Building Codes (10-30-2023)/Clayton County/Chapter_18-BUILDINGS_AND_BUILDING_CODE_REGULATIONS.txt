(Ord. No. 2010-122, § 1(18-4.3), 6-8-10)
Sec. 18-44. - Issuing permits.
(a)
Action on permits. The county official shall act upon an application for permit without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. If the county official is satisfied that the work described in an application for a permit and the contract documents filed therewith conform to the requirements of the construction codes and other pertinent laws and ordinances, he/she shall issue a permit to the applicant.
(b)
Refusal to issue permit. If the application for a permit and the accompanying contract documents describing the work do not conform to the requirements of the construction codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances, the county official shall not issue a permit, but shall return the contract documents to the applicant with his refusal to issue such permit. Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal.
(c)
Special foundation permit. When application for a permit to erect or enlarge a building has been filed and pending issuances of such permit, the county official may, at his/her discretion, issue a special permit for the foundation only. The holder of such a special permit is proceeding at his own risk and without assurance that a permit for the remainder of the work will be granted nor that corrections will not be required in order to meet provisions of the construction codes.
(d)
Public right-of-way. A permit shall not be given by the county official for the construction of any building, or for the alteration of any building where said building is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies, or other appendages or projections fronting on any street, alley, or public lane, or for the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises and it shall be the duty of the county official to see that the street lines are not encroached upon except as provided for in Chapter 33 of the International Building Code.
(Ord. No. 2010-122, § 1(18-4.4), 6-8-10)
Sec. 18-45. - Contractor responsibilities.

In such case that the state requires a contractor to have obtained a state license before they are permitted to perform work, the contractor shall supply the local government with their license number before receiving a permit for work to be performed.
(Ord. No. 2010-122, § 1(18-4.5), 6-8-10)
Sec. 18-46. - Conditions of the permit.
(a)
Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the county official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months from its issuance (commencement will be the first recorded inspection), or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months from the time of the last recorded inspection. All permits will expire 18 months from issuance, except that the county official is authorized to grant one or more extensions of time for additional periods of not more than 180 days each. The extension shall be requested in writing prior to the expiration of the existing permit and justifiable cause demonstrated.
(b)
Plans. When the county official issues a permit, he/she shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "approved for code compliance." One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the county official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the county official.

The applicant shall certify the routing of the movement, the date and time of the movement, the tonnage weight of the loaded vehicle or vehicles moving the house, or other building or buildings, or structure and the safety precautions to be utilized in the protection of personal and property rights of others during such movement. The county official may require additional information and/or safety precautions if, in his/her judgment, he/she does not believe the moving plan to be feasible or that the necessary safety precautions are being taken. if he/she does disapprove, he/she may require that a different routing and/or additional safety precautions be taken in order to protect the personal and property rights of individuals.
(3)
The applicant must, upon making application, give the width, length and height of the building to be moved. No routing will be approved for movement without assurance that the movement can be made without disturbing or damaging obstructions on the sides or above the route to be taken. If there are any road signs, mailboxes, overhead wiring, traffic lights, traffic signals, bridges, or other obstacles on the route chosen, it shall be the duty of the applicant to ensure that the building or structure that is being moved shall clear all of those obstructions without damage.
(4)
Any person who desires to move along county maintained roads a house, or other building or buildings, or structure into, out of, or through the county shall post with the department of community development as cash bond in the sum of $750.00. Such bond shall be used to repair, replace or otherwise compensate the county or any citizens of the county damaged by the moving of a house, or other building or buildings, or structure through the county. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of any person to $750.00. If, after 15 days from the receipt of a notice of claim for damages to the mover, the mover fails to respond, the county official may, at his/her discretion, use such cash bond to replace, repair or otherwise compensate the person for damages caused by the movement of the house, or other building or buildings, or structure.

The applicant shall provide to the department of community development a certification from the county tax commissioner, and the taxing authorities of any applicable municipality that all ad valorem property taxes assessed against the building structure to be moved have been paid in full.

If the amount finally determined to be the tax liability for the property exceeds the amount paid under this section, the applicant or property owner shall be liable for the amount of the difference between the amount paid and the amount owed. In no event shall a moving permit be issued to an applicant to move any house, or other building or buildings, or structure through the county until the certification required by this section is tendered by the applicant.
