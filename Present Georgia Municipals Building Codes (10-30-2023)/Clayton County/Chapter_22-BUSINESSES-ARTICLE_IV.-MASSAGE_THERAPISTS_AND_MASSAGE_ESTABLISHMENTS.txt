ARTICLE IV. - MASSAGE THERAPISTS AND MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 22-116. - Findings; public purpose.
Based upon the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities within the Atlanta metropolitan area, which experiences are relevant to the problems encountered by the county, and based upon the evidence and testimony of certain citizens of the county, the board of commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to certain establishments offering massage treatment and related services. Moreover, it is the findings of the board of commissioners that, under certain circumstances, the provision of unregulated massage services may beget criminal behavior and tend to create undesirable community conditions. Furthermore, where such resulting illicit or illegal activities are present, they have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life in general. Accordingly, the board of commissioners deems it in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the county to reduce the adverse impact of certain undesirable massage therapists and massage establishments by providing reasonable regulations pertinent to their operation. To this end, this article is hereby adopted.
