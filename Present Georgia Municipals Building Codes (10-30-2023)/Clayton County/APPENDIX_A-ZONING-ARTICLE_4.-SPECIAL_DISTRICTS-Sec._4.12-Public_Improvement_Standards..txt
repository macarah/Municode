Sec. 4.12 - Public Improvement Standards.
Public rights-of-way within the Overlay District shall be improved in accordance with the following standards:
A.
Street Standards. Street standards shall be designed in accordance with the Department of Transportation and Development's Land Disturbance and Right-of-Way Construction Guidelines.
B.
Multi-Use Paths.
1.
No motorized vehicles
2.
Maximum grade of 6 percent.
3.
20-feet wide dedicated easement.
4.
12 feet wide and concrete construction.
5.
Shoulder width variable, based on topography.
6.
5-feet flare at street intersections, with ramp to street and removable bollards spaced 6 feet apart to block motorized traffic. The Sight Visibility Standards (SV) of Article 6.27 must be maintained.
7.
Multi-use paths shall be located outside all required buffers, except that a required buffer may contain one or more crossings of a multi-use path provided that such crossing:
a.
Is part of an approved multi-modal access plan required in Article 4.11 of this Ordinance.
b.
Is approximately perpendicular to the required buffer.
c.
Is designed to have the least disruption to the intended screening provided by the required buffer.
8.
Multi-use paths shall be required in order to facilitate pedestrian access from residential and non-residential developments to schools, parks, playgrounds and other County amenities via the multi-use path system. If, at the time of conceptual approval, there are no completed multi-use paths to which the multi-use paths of the proposed developer can be linked, the developer may, at its option, and only with the approval of the Zoning Administrator, in lieu of installing the multi-use paths, dedicate the easements and deposit a cash payment with the Board of Commissioners equal to the cost of installing the multi-use paths. This cost shall be determined by the County engineer. Such deposit shall be placed in a multi-use path construction fund to be established by the Board of Commissioners. When the multi-use system is extended to the boundary of the development, the Board of Commissioners will use the deposit to construct the multi-use paths in the development.
C.
Sidewalks.
1.
All sidewalks shall have a minimum width of 5 feet along all roads in residentially zoned or used areas and 6 feet in all commercial, industrial, and mixed use development areas as defined within the Department of Transportation and Development's Land Disturbance and Right-of-Way Construction Guidelines.

2.
Where a lot on the external boundary of the Cherry Hills, the Highway 138, the Tara Boulevard Overlay District adjoins the boundary of any property outside the delineated Overlay District that is zoned for any non-residential zoning classification and/or non-residential use, a buffer yard shall be planted as identified within Article 6.35. Buffer Yard Standards (BY).
3.
Said buffer yard shall not be paved and shall not be used for parking, loading, storage, or any other use, expect where necessary to grade or modify a portion of the yard buffer for the installation of utilities necessitated by the development. Water detention ponds shall not be located within buffer yard. No trees, other than dead or diseased trees, shall be removed from said buffer yard, but additional trees and plant material may be added to the buffer yard.
G.
Street and Pedestrian Lighting.

A variance may be requested to be heard by the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with Article 13.21, Variance Process (VA).
