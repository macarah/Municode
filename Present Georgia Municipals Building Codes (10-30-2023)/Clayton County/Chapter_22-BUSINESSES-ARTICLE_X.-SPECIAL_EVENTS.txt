Director: The Director of the Department of Community Development of Clayton County, Georgia, or his designee for the administration of this chapter.
Producer: Any person, group of persons, organization, association, club, or other entity responsible for planning, producing and conducting an event.
Special event: The term "special event" or "event" shall mean any organized activity having as its purpose entertainment, recreation and/or education, such as a festival or celebration, foot or vehicle race, parade or march, rally or assembly which takes place on a public street, sidewalk or right-of-way, or occurs on private or government property and impacts government services on public rights-of-way.
Such "special event," when it provides for food sales and alcohol sales by vendors, shall constitute "an authorized catered function" as that term is used in O.C.G.A. § 3-11-2 et seq.
Vendor: Any person or persons who engage in the sale to the public of any food or food products, including beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, goods, services, or merchandise of whatever nature from any location, either mobile or stationary, on a temporary itinerant basis in connection with a special event. The definition of vendor, as used in this chapter, shall not be construed to include or prohibit a permanent business, operating under the provisions of business license ordinances and other applicable laws, from displaying goods or merchandise on a public sidewalk immediately in front of and adjacent to the permanent business structure so long as such displays do not impede the normal flow of pedestrian traffic and so long as other laws and ordinances pertaining to such business or displays are complied with.
