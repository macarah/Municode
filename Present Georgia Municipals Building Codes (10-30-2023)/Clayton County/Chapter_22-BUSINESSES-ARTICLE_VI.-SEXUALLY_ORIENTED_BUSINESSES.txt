ARTICLE VI. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES

Sec. 22-400. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, sexually oriented businesses, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse affect on property values and on the public health, safety, and welfare of the county, and on its citizens and property, and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression. This article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of sexually oriented businesses versus any legally protected rights of sexually oriented businesses and patrons. This article is not intended to allow or license any business establishment or activity which would otherwise be unlawful.
