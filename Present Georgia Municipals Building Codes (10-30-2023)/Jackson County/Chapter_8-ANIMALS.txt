Secs. 8-126—8-140. - Reserved.
ARTICLE VI. - RABIES CONTROL

Sec. 8-141. - Strict confinement of animals.
For the purposes of this chapter, strict confinement/isolation of animals means confinement for the period of time required by this article and kept inside a home, basement, garage, or suitable building, and isolated from other animals and people other than the caretaker while the animal is being observed for symptoms of rabies. An animal within a fenced yard, on a chain, or otherwise in an area accessible in any way to other animals or persons other than the caretaker is not in a strictly confined area.
(Ord. No. 16-008 , 12-19-2016)
Sec. 8-142. - Animal attack.
For the purposes of this chapter, an animal attack means any physical contact of the teeth, nails, or claws of an animal with human flesh, including, but not limited to, a scrape, puncture, pierce, scratch or tear, so long as bleeding results.
(Ord. No. 16-008 , 12-19-2016)
Sec. 8-143. - Potential human exposure to rabies.
For the purposes of this chapter, potential human exposure to rabies means any bite, scratch, or other situation in which saliva or central nervous system (CNS) tissue of a potentially rabid animal enters an open wound, fresh wound, or comes in contact with a mucous membrane by entering the eye, mouth, or nose. Touching or handling a potentially rabid animal with the possible exception of a bat or touching or handling another animal or inanimate object that has had contact with a rabid animal does not constitute an exposure unless wet saliva or CNS tissue entered a fresh, open wound or had contact with a mucous membrane. Likewise, contact with the urine, feces, or blood of a potentially rabid animal does not constitute an exposure since the pathogenesis of rabies is such that the virus follows nerve pathways and has only limited circulation in the blood.
(Ord. No. 16-008 , 12-19-2016)
Sec. 8-144. - Notice concerning attacking and biting animals; quarantine.
(a)
Quarantine of biting animals.

(1)
At the owner's request, the animal may be quarantined at a licensed veterinary clinic. If such clinic is closed or otherwise unable to take the animal at that time, the animal will be immediately transported to animal control facilities and held until the animal can be transported to a licensed veterinary clinic.
(2)
Nothing shall prohibit county animal control from allowing an animal to remain in strict confinement on the premises of the owner subject to daily inspections by county animal control so long as the health, safety, and welfare of any person or animal is not threatened. Those animals may include, but are not limited to, the following:
a.
A female animal that is nursing offspring and that is current on her rabies vaccination.
b.
A vaccinated animal if the animal has a medical condition, verified by a written statement from a licensed veterinarian, and confinement at animal control facilities or a veterinary clinic would be detrimental to the health and welfare of the animal.

(e)
Any animal bitten by a suspected or proven rabid animal that is not destroyed and manifests any of the symptoms of rabies shall be immediately examined by a licensed veterinarian. If the licensed veterinarian determines the animal is displaying symptoms of rabies and the symptoms cannot be attributed to any other illness or injury, the animal shall be humanely euthanized and county animal control shall be notified.
(f)
All animals will be managed in accordance with the guidelines established in the most current edition of the state rabies control manual.
