ARTICLE II. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION

Sec. 26-60. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Groundwater recharge area means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. The term "groundwater recharge area" is synonymous with the term "aquifer recharge area."
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities.
Pollution susceptibility maps means maps prepared by the state department of natural resources that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential.
Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by the state department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.
(Ord. of 11-13-2001, § 11)
Sec. 26-61. - Penalties.
Any person who commits, takes part in or assists in any violation of any provision of this article shall be fined not more than $500.00 for each offense, or up to 60 days in jail. Each violation shall be a separate offense and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense.
(Ord. of 11-13-2001, § 5)
Sec. 26-62. - Findings of fact.
(a)
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and to promote a healthy economic climate in the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that public drinking water resources of high quality be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources in the county and surrounding communities rely upon such resources as sources of public water.
(b)
Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas to ensure that pollution threats to water resources are minimized.
(Ord. of 11-13-2001, § 1.2)
Sec. 26-63. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(2)
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
(3)
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.
(Ord. of 11-13-2001, § 1.3)
Sec. 26-64. - Establishment of groundwater recharge area district.
A groundwater recharge area district is established which shall correspond to all lands in the unincorporated areas of the county, outside the City of Buena Vista, that are mapped and designated as significant recharge areas by the state department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition.
(Ord. of 11-13-2001, § 2)
Sec. 26-65. - Determination of pollution susceptibility.
Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium or low based on the groundwater pollution susceptibility map prepared by the state department of natural resources.
(Ord. of 11-13-2001, § 3)
Sec. 26-66. - Permit requirements and enforcement.

(Ord. of 11-13-2001, § 9)
Sec. 26-71. - Section M of manual for on-site sewage management systems.
The text set forth in this section is from the state department of human resources manual for on-site sewage management systems, section M, pages M-1 and M-2, and is included here for convenience only. In the event of any conflict between the following text and the referenced manual, the referenced manual shall govern:
(1)
Lot sizing. To provide for the orderly and safe development of property utilizing on-site sewage management systems, minimum lot sizes have been established. Larger lot sizes may be required to meet the requirements of this manual depending on the proposed development of the property. County boards of health and/or county zoning authorities may require larger minimum lot sizes; the larger minimum lot sizes will take precedence.
a.
Single-family dwellings. Lot size requirements are for single-family dwellings, including, but not limited to, manufactured or mobile homes, stick built homes, modular homes, etc., and individual lots in subdivisions or mobile home lots located in areas other than commercial mobile home parks. Area requirements for multiple dwellings on a single recorded lot, where not prohibited by local zoning, must be provided in multiples of the following minimum lot sizes for each dwelling to be constructed on the recorded lot. See table MT-1 and subsections (1)a.1—6 of this section as follows:

Maximum sewage flow 600 gallons/acre/day 1200 gallons/acre/day
  *Note—In this consent the term "nonpublic" means an individual water supply system or any other water supply system which is not a public water supply system.
1.
The minimum lot sizes in the table in this subsection are for the typical size home (three or four bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees, and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed to be constructed, or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the county board of health will require larger lots to ensure useable soil area.
2.
The county board of health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features.
3.
Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively.
4.
The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size:
(i)
Rights-of-way of roads;
(ii)
Easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system;
(iii)
Bodies of water;
(iv)
Land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water; and
(v)
Similar limiting factors.
5.
There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent county zoning setbacks and other space requirements must be also be met.
6.
The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpd when served by nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpd when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these qualities (600 or 1,200 gpd as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpd maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd.
(i)
To determine X = the square footage of the lot needed, use the following formula:
EXPAND
X = 5,000 gallons/acre/day 1,200 gallons/acre/day
= 4.17 acres
= 4.17 acres × 43560 ft 2 /acre
= 181,500-foot 2 area of land needed
  (ii)
Likewise, for a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine Y = the square footage of the lot needed for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula:
EXPAND
Y = 5000 gal/day 600 gal/acre/day
= 8.33 acres
= 8.33 acres × 43560 ft 2 /acre
= 363,000 ft 2 area of land needed
  b.
Lot sizing requirements are as follows: for multifamily residential dwellings, and other non-single-family dwelling and commercial structures, and this also includes mobile homes located in commercial mobile home parks. Subsections (1)a.1—6 of this section also apply to table MT-2.

ARTICLE III. - WETLAND PROTECTION

Sec. 26-100. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Generalized wetland map means a map showing the general locations of wetlands within the unincorporated areas of the county. The generalized wetland map used at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived is the National Wetlands Inventory as published by the United States Department of Interior.
Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soils conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service.
Hydrology means the science dealing with the properties, distribution, and circulation of water on the surface of the land, in the soil and underlying rocks, and in the atmosphere.
Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions.
Jurisdictional determination means an official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, stating whether a certain specified site is a wetland or is in a wetland.
Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in section 26-104(c).
Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
Wetland delineation means the establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps.
Wetland protection district means all wetlands within the unincorporated area of the county and shown on the generalized wetland map.
(Ord. of 11-13-2001, § 10)
Sec. 26-101. - Penalties.
Any person who commits, takes part in or assists in any violation of any provision of this article may be fined not more than $500.00 for each offense, or up to 60 days in jail. Each violation shall be a separate offense and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense.
(Ord. of 11-13-2001, § 5)
Sec. 26-102. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact. Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. Wetlands provide habitat for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. Nationally, a considerable number of wetland resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. It is, therefore, necessary to discourage development activities that may adversely affect wetlands by ensuring maximum protection for wetlands located in the unincorporated area of the county.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic, nature and wildlife habitat.
(Ord. of 11-13-2001, § 1)
Sec. 26-103. - Wetland protection district.
(a)
Generalized wetland map. This article shall apply to all lands within wetlands located in the unincorporated area of the county outside the municipalities. The generalized wetland map adopted as part of this article shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the county clerk.
(b)
Boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners that a subject site may be in a jurisdictional wetland or in proximity to a jurisdictional wetland, requiring the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to initiation of any development activity on the subject site. The generalized wetland map does not represent precise boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands in the unincorporated area of the county, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. of 11-13-2001, § 2)
Sec. 26-104. - Local development permits.
(a)
Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the permitting officer in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (b) of this section shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development appears to be located within a wetland protection district boundary, or within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the permitting officer from review of the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following receipt by the local permitting officer of a copy of the section 404 permit or letter of permission issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
(b)
Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein:
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(4)
The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall, however, be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. Disturbances of wetlands for agricultural purposes are subject to the Swampbuster Act of the 1985 Farm Bill, and are to be reported to the USDA Farm Service Agency prior to commencement.
(5)
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed.
(6)
Education, scientific research and nature trails.
(c)
Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the permitting officer for the following reasons:
(1)
Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged, and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the permitting officer, and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired, and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized.
(2)
Temporary water level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations.
(3)
Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (b)(4) of this section.
(4)
Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided such facilities and structures are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.
(d)
