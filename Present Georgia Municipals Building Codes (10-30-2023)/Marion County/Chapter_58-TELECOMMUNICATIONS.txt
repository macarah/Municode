ARTICLE II. - TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES

Sec. 58-23. - Purpose.
The purpose of the supplemental regulations is to:
(1)
Promote health, safety, and the general welfare of the residents of the county;
(2)
Provide standards for the safe provision of telecommunications consistent with applicable federal and state regulations;
(3)
Minimize the total number of telecommunications towers in the community by encouraging shared use of existing and future towers and the use of existing tall buildings and other high structures and by encouraging alternative technologies that would minimize the need for multiple towers; and
(4)
Minimize adverse visual effects from telecommunications towers by requiring careful siting, visual impact assessment, and appropriate landscaping.
(Ord. of 12-12-2006(02), § 1)
Sec. 58-24. - Special permit, site plan approval and variance.
Telecommunications facilities may be constructed anywhere in the county, but only if the person seeking to erect same shall have obtained a special permit and site plan approval from the planning board in accordance with this section and the other provisions of this article governing issuance of special permits and site plan approves prior to any construction. If the proposed height of the telecommunications facility exceeds the permitted height of structures in the zoning district in which the facility is proposed to be located, notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, a height variance from the board of appeals shall also be required.
(Ord. of 12-12-2006(02), § 2)
Sec. 58-25. - General criteria.
(a)
No special permit or renewal thereof or modification of a current special permit relating to a telecommunications facility shall be authorized by the planning board unless it finds that such telecommunications facility:
(1)
Is necessary to meet current or reasonably expected demands for services;
(2)
Conforms with all federal and state laws and all applicable rules or regulations promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), or any other federal agencies having jurisdiction;
(3)
Is considered a public utility in the state;
(4)
Is sited, designed and constructed in a manner which minimizes:
a.
Visual impact to the extent practical; and
b.
Adverse impacts upon migratory and other birds and wildlife;
(5)
Complies with all other requirements of this article, unless expressly superseded herein;
(6)
Is the most appropriate site among those available within the technically feasible area for the location of a telecommunications facility;
(7)
When including the construction of a tower, is designed to accommodate future shared use by at least two other telecommunication service providers.
(b)
Any subsequent location of telecommunication equipment by other service providers on existing towers specifically designed for shared use shall not require a new or modified special permit if there would be no increase in the height of the tower and if the tower's original design was adequate to accommodate the proposed additional equipment. At the option of the building and zoning enforcement officer, there may be required, before issuance of a building permit, an engineer's certificate or report to the effect that with the proposed additional equipment the existing tower continues to be safe and meets all then currently applicable design and construction criteria in accordance with generally accepted good engineering practices and generally accepted industry standards.
(Ord. of 12-12-2006(02), § 3)
Sec. 58-26. - Collocation.
(a)
The shared use of existing telecommunications facilities or other structures shall be preferred to the construction of new facilities. Any special permit application, renewal or modification thereof shall include proof that reasonable efforts have been made to collocate within an existing telecommunications facility or upon an existing structure. The application shall include an adequate inventory report specifying existing telecommunications facility sites and structures exceeding 75 percent of the height of the proposed tower within the search range of the cell grid. The inventory report shall contain an evaluation of opportunities for shared use as an alternative to the proposed location.
(b)
The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed telecommunications facility cannot be accommodated on existing telecommunications facility sites in the inventory due to one or more of the following reasons:
(1)
The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of existing and approved telecommunications facilities or other structures, considering existing and reasonably anticipated future use for those facilities;
(2)
The planned equipment would cause radio frequency interference with other existing or planned equipment, which cannot be reasonably prevented;
(3)
Existing or approved telecommunications facilities or other structures do not have space and cannot be modified to provide space on which proposed equipment can be placed so it can function effectively and reasonably;
(4)
Other technical reasons make it impracticable to place the equipment proposed by the applicant on existing facilities or structures;
(5)
The property owner or owner of the existing telecommunications facility or other structure refuses to allow such collocation.
(Ord. of 12-12-2006(02), § 4)
Sec. 58-27. - Priority of siting locations.
In determining whether a site is appropriate, and if it is determined a need exists for the telecommunications facility, the preferential order of location, to the extent the same may be, or may be made, technically feasible, is as follows:
(1)
Collocated on existing telecommunications towers;
(2)
Collocated on any other existing radio or other tower that would not require any increase in height nor significant noticeable structural additions to accommodate the telecommunications facility;
(3)
Within any industrial zones or existing planned development zones that permit industrial activities.
(Ord. of 12-12-2006(02), § 5)
Sec. 58-28. - Dimensional standards.
(a)
A fall zone around any tower constructed as part of a telecommunications facility must have a radius at least equal to the height of the tower and any attached antennas. The entire fall zone may not include public roads and must be located on property either owned or leased by the applicant or for which the applicant has obtained an easement, and may not, except as set forth in this section, contain any structure other than those associated with the telecommunications facility. If the facility is attached to an existing structure, relief may be granted by specific permission of the planning board on a case-by-case basis if it is determined by such board, after submission of competent evidence, that the waiver of this requirement will not endanger the life, health, welfare or property of any person. In granting any such waiver, the board may impose any conditions reasonably necessary to protect the public or other property from potential injury.
(b)
All telecommunications facilities shall be located on a single parcel.
(c)
All telecommunications facilities shall comply with the setback, frontage, minimum lot size, and yard standards of the underlying zoning district and the fall zone requirements of this article. To the extent there is a conflict, the more restrictive provision shall govern. The size of the leased or owned lot, together with any land over which the applicant has obtained an easement, shall be, at a minimum, sufficiently large to include the entire fall zone. All lots leased or owned for the purpose of construction of a tower as part of telecommunications facility shall conform, at a minimum, to the lot size requirements of the underlying zoning district or the size of lot necessary to encompass the entire fall zone (to the extent easements for any part of the fall zone that extends outside the minimum lot sized permitted in the zoning district have not been obtained), whichever requirement results in a larger lot.
(d)
Notwithstanding provisions to the contrary of any other section of this article, the front, side, and rear yard requirements of the underlying zoning district in which a telecommunications facility is erected shall apply not only to a tower, but also to all tower parts including guy wires and anchors, and to any accessory buildings.
(Ord. of 12-12-2006(02), § 6)
Sec. 58-29. - Lighting and marking.
(a)
Towers shall not be artificially lighted and marked beyond the requirements of the FAA.
(b)
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, an applicant may be compelled to add FAA-style lighting and marking, if, in the judgment of the planning board, such a requirement would be of direct benefit to public safety and would not unduly adversely affect residents of any surrounding property.
(Ord. of 12-12-2006(02), § 7)
Sec. 58-30. - Appearance and buffering.
(a)
The use of any portion of a telecommunications facility for signs, promotional or advertising purposes, including, but not limited to, company name, phone numbers, banners, streamers, and balloons, is prohibited.
(b)
The facility shall have the least practical visual effect on the environment, as determined by the planning board. Any tower that is not subject to FAA marking as set forth in section 58-29 shall otherwise:
(1)
Have a galvanized finish, or shall be painted gray above the surrounding tree line and gray or green below the tree line, as deemed appropriate by the planning board; or
(2)
Be disguised or camouflaged to blend in with the surroundings, to the extent that such alteration does not impair the ability of the facility to perform its designed function.
(c)
Without limiting the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible, and no cutting of trees exceeding four inches in diameter (measured at a height of four feet off the ground) shall occur in connection with the telecommunications facility prior to the granting of special permit and site plan approval. The clearcutting of all trees in a single contiguous area exceeding 20,000 square feet shall be prohibited.
(d)
The planning board may require additional information, such as line-of-sight drawings, detailed elevation maps, visual simulations, before and after renderings, and alternate tower designs to more clearly identify adverse impacts for the purpose of their mitigation.
(e)
Equipment or vehicles not used in direct support, renovations, additions or repair of any telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the facility site.
(Ord. of 12-12-2006(02), § 8)
Sec. 58-31. - Access and parking.
(a)
Access ways shall make maximum use of existing public or private roads to the extent practicable. New access ways constructed solely for telecommunications facilities must be at least 12 but no more than 24 feet wide, and closely follow natural contours to ensure minimal visual disturbance and reduce soil erosion potential.
(b)
The road surface (driveways) shall be centered within access ways and shall not comprise more than 60 percent of the width of the access way.
(c)
Parking areas shall be sufficient to accommodate the usual number of service vehicles expected on the premises at any one time. Space off of public highways shall be provided (not necessarily in parking areas) to accommodate the greatest number of service vehicles expected on the premises at any one time.
(d)
Driveways or parking areas shall provide adequate interior turnaround, such that service vehicles will not have to back out onto a public thoroughfare.
(Ord. of 12-12-2006(02), § 9)
Sec. 58-32. - Security.
(a)
Towers, anchor points of guyed towers, and accessory structures shall each be surrounded by fencing at least eight feet in height, the top foot of which will be comprised of three strands of barbed wire to discourage unauthorized access to the site.
(b)
There shall be no permanent climbing pegs within 15 feet of the ground of any tower.
(c)
A locked gate at the junction of the access way and a public thoroughfare may be required to obstruct entry by unauthorized vehicles. Such gate must not protrude into the public right-of-way.
(Ord. of 12-12-2006(02), § 10)
Sec. 58-33. - Engineering and maintenance.
(a)
Site plans for all telecommunications facilities must bear the seal of a professional engineer licensed to practice in the state. Every facility shall be built, operated and maintained to acceptable industry standards, including, but not limited to, the most recent, applicable standards of the Institute of Electric and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
(b)
A safety analysis by a qualified professional must accompany any special permit or site plan application, renewal thereof or modification, for the purpose of certifying that general public electromagnetic radiation exposure does not exceed standards set by the FCC or any permit granted by FCC. Exceptions are transmitters for land mobile, cellular and amateur radio stations.
(Ord. of 12-12-2006(02), § 11)
Sec. 58-34. - Removal.
(a)
At the time of submittal of the application for a special permit for a telecommunications facility, the applicant shall submit an agreement to remove all antennas, structures, lighting, utilities, fencing, gates, accessory equipment or structures, as well as any towers dedicated solely for use within a telecommunications facility if such facility becomes technologically obsolete or ceases to perform its originally intended function for more than one consecutive months. Upon removal of said facility, the land shall be restored to its previous condition, including, but not limited to, the seeding of exposed soils, unless the land owner notifies the planning board in writing that any buildings or roads may remain.
(b)
At the time of obtaining a building permit, the applicant must provide a financial security bond for removal of the telecommunications facility and property restoration, with the municipality as the assignee, in an amount approved by the planning board, but not less than $50,000.00.
(c)
At times of modification of the special permit, the planning board may adjust the required amount of the financial security bond to adequately cover increases in the cost of removal of the telecommunications facility and property restoration.
(Ord. of 12-12-2006(02), § 12)
Sec. 58-35. - Application.
