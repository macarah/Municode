In order to provide for the public health, safety, morality and general welfare of the citizens of the county, the following zoning criteria are established.

B.

If denied, will the effect on the applicant's property value under the existing zoning be offset by the gain to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public?

Has the property been undeveloped an unusual length of time as currently zoned, considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property?

I.
Does the subject property have a reasonable economic use as currently zoned?
J.
Are there other existing or changing conditions affecting the use or development of the subject property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal?
K.
Would the change create an isolated district unrelated to the surrounding district such as "spot zoning"?
L.
Are the present zoning district boundaries illogically drawn in relation to existing conditions in the area?
M.
Is the change requested out of scale with the needs of the county as a whole or the immediate neighborhood?
