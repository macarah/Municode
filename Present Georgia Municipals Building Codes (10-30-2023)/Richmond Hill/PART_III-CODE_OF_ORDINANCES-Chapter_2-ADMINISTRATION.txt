As certain records are essential for varying lengths of time for conducting business, the continuity of government, the protection of the rights and privileges of its citizens, and as documentary evidence of our heritage, the City of Richmond Hill resolves to implement a records management program.
Except as otherwise provided by law, ordinance, or policy adopted by the governing body, all records shall be open to the public or the state or any agency thereof (O.C.G.A. § 50-18-99(g)).

Electronically generated materials (such as email, electronic data interchange and other forms of electronic materials) are recognized as a standard format for official public records. The city shall formally designate the authorized formats for official records. Digital data, as with any form of official record, shall be safeguarded against loss, unauthorized destruction or modification, and shall be included in data security and records management policy and procedures.
(d)
Adoption of statewide records retention schedules. The City of Richmond Hill officially recognizes and adopts the records retention schedule approved by the state records committee and the Georgia Archives and set forth by the Georgia Records Act (O.C.G.A. § 50-18-94(6)). No public records shall be disposed of, destroyed or given away except in accordance with this schedule.

The following rules and regulations shall apply to the rental and use of all available city facilities by the general public:
(a)
Rules for the use and rental of city facilities. The city provides and maintains its facilities and equipment for the primary purpose of governmental programs and services for its citizens and staff. In an effort to nurture community support and involvement, the city may allow the use of its buildings for appropriate educational, civic, cultural, and recreational activities. In an effort to be good stewards of such facilities, the city may limit use of facilities as described in this policy and/or may charge for use out of concerns regarding safety, security, wear and tear on buildings, increased utilities cost, inconvenience for staff members, liability concerns, and ethics concerns.
It is the policy of the city that its facilities may be used by individuals or organizations for appropriate educational, civic, cultural, and recreational activities that do not interfere with city programs, activities, and events, on the following terms and conditions:
(1)
Organizations whose primary purpose is to provide funds, provide support, give other assistance for local activities or events shall have priority in use of city facilities.
(2)
Civic clubs or similar organizations whose purpose, among others, is to raise funds or otherwise provide support for programs of local interest shall also have priority.
(3)
A city facility may be rented or leased to individuals or organizations for a specific event when such use does not interfere with the normal operations of the city and when no city or other governmental activity is scheduled for said facility. City facilities shall not be rented to any individual or organization on a consistent, repetitious basis such as daily, weekly, or monthly.
(4)
City-sponsored activities shall have first priority. All other activities shall be scheduled on a "first come first serve" basis with the city manager maintaining a calendar of events which are scheduled in the respective facilities. The city may require payment of law enforcement personnel for safety and crowd control.
(5)
Use of city facilities for commercial or profit-making purposes is not permitted. However, city council may make appropriate exceptions on a case by case basis for such events as festivals or parades or other activities which directly or indirectly benefit the city, its citizens or the local area.
(6)
Any individual or organization using city facilities must reimburse the city for the use of facilities, for the cost of utilities, for staff needed for security, and/or cleaning purposes, and/or other incidental costs as determined by the city. Facilities cannot be used by individuals or organizations except during designated hours for each facility. The city manager shall make rules and procedures for each facility consistent with this policy which will implement the intent of this policy.
(7)
Before any individual or organization is permitted to use city facilities, representatives must demonstrate that the facilities will be protected and that those in charge can ensure to the city manager's satisfaction that the facilities will not be damaged in any respect and that any expense to the city will be reimbursed by those using the facility.
(8)
The city reserves the right to cancel the use agreement if it is found the facilities are needed for city or other governmental use or to rescind the agreement if it is determined that the intended use is inimical to the best interests of the city.
Rental fees must be paid in advance and shall include all time required for the planned event - such as set-up, dress rehearsals, and clean-up. The individual or organization renting the facility shall be responsible for providing its own set-up and clean-up and after the event, respectively. Tables, chairs and other equipment shall be left in the same arrangement and condition as found. The facility shall be properly cleaned immediately after the conclusion of the event. If city personnel are employed by the individual or organization to provide the set-up and clean-up, they shall be paid directly by the individual or organization at a rate of at least one and one-half their regular rate as determined by the city salary schedule.
The individual or organization renting the facility may be required to employ and pay security personnel as deemed necessary by the city.
(b)
Damage to facilities. The renting individuals or organizations shall reimburse the city for any damages that might occur to facilities during or as a result of their planned event.
(c)
Alcohol and tobacco usages. Except upon licensed premises or with a special permit from city council, no alcoholic beverages shall be allowed on any city property at any time and in any fashion.
All city facilities are tobacco-free, and renting organizations and patrons must adhere to this policy.
(d)
Release of liability. The renting individual or organization agrees to release the city from all liability associated with the use of the building or facility. User evidence of liability insurance may be required.

Exemption of fees. When deemed appropriate, city council may choose to waive fees for sponsoring organizations of a governmental or civic-minded nature for events which serve to promote local or governmental interests.
