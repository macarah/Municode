101.2. - Code remedial.
This code is hereby declared to be remedial and shall be construed to secure the beneficial interests and purposes thereof, which are public safety, health, and general welfare, through structural strength, stability, sanitation, and safety to life and property from hazards incident to the construction, alteration, repair, removal, demolition, use, neglect, and use of structures or premises.
101.3. - Scope.

101.5. - Maintenance.
All structures, both existing and new, and all parts thereof, shall be maintained in a safe, sanitary and fully functioning condition.
