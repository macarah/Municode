Definitions.
(1)
"Prescribed burning" means the controlled application of fire to existing vegetative fuels under specified environmental conditions and following appropriate precautionary measures, which causes the fire to be confined to a predetermined area and accomplishes one (1) or more planned land management objectives as specified in paragraphs 12-6-146(3), (4), and (7) of the Georgia Prescribed Burning Act or to mitigate catastrophic wildfires. Burning to facilitate land use changes (such as a change from forest land to residential, commercial, or industrial development or a different agricultural use) is not considered prescribed burning, and should therefore be considered a land clearing operation subject to the provisions of subparagraph 391-3-1-.02(5)(a)11. (Note: This definition includes what was previously defined as prescribed burning and as slash burning.)
(2)
"Recreational burning" means the burning of materials other than rubbish where fuel being burned is not contained in an incinerator, outdoor fireplace, barbecue grill or barbecue pit and with a total fuel area of three (3) feet or less in diameter and two (2) feet (610 mm) or less in height for pleasure, religious, ceremonial, cooking or similar purposes.
