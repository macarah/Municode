Sec. 10-31. - Findings; public purpose.
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to Houston, Texas, Tucson, Arizona, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Dayton, Ohio, and Gwinnett County, Georgia, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the City of Snellville, and based on documentary evidence and oral presentation during the meeting of the mayor and council on March 24, 2003; and based upon the record of the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners' public hearing and regular meeting on August 7, 2001, including the record of testimony by Colonel John Latty, Officer John Jenkins, and Investigator J. P. Droualt of the Gwinnett Police Department, and further comments in that meeting by representatives of the adult entertainment industry, the mayor and council of the City of Snellville take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country.
It is the finding of the mayor and council of the City of Snellville that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community.
Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment, are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described. The mayor and council of the City of Snellville find it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the City of Snellville, as well.
Furthermore, it is the finding of the mayor and council of the City of Snellville that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities.
The mayor and council of the City of Snellville find that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon the City of Snellville are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities. In addition, Gwinnett County's experience with the adult bookstore located within the county has shown that a substantial amount of activity at the bookstore involves booths which an individual may enter, view videos depicting sexual activity, and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth through a hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths.
The City of Snellville, Georgia, therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of houses of worship (religious institutions), schools, residential areas, public parks and children's daycare facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the mayor and council of the City of Snellville find that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The mayor and council of the City of Snellville find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further find that such will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression, which rights are expressly acknowledged herein. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.
