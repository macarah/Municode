Sec. 10-102. - Management of animals that scratch or bite humans.
(a)
Dogs and cats. A healthy dog or cat that bites or scratches a person or another animal should be confined and observed for ten days. This required quarantine applies to dogs and cats only. The rabies vaccine should not be administered during the observation period. While in confinement, any signs of illness should be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian. The place of confinement shall be at the veterinary clinic or agency designated by the city as the animal shelter at the expense of the owner or person having custody or possession of the animal, the veterinarian chosen by the owner or person having the custody or possession of the animal at such owner's expense, or any other confinement location so designated and approved by the city. If symptoms suggestive of rabies are observed, the animal should be humanely killed, and a specimen should be submitted to a qualified laboratory for testing. If the animal dies during the quarantine period, the specimen should be submitted immediately for rabies testing.
(b)
Stray domestic animals and other species. Any stray or unwanted animal that bites or scratches a person or domestic animal may be humanely euthanized and a specimen submitted for testing. Animals, other than dogs or cats, that bite or scratch a person and are suspected of being rabid should immediately be reported to the county health department. Management of animals, other than dogs and cats, is dependent upon the animal species, the circumstances of the bite, and the epidemiology of rabies in the area, and shall be at the discretion of the animal control officer or the county health department or their authorized representative.
(c)
Livestock. Cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, goats, swine and sheep are not likely to be carriers of rabies. Treatment will be weighed against the circumstances of exposure by the animal control officer or the county health department or their authorized representative. If, at the time of exposure, the animal is clinically ill with signs suggestive of rabies, the animal control officer or his authorized representative, or an authorized representative from the county health department, will immediately and humanely kill the animal, and a specimen will be submitted to a qualified laboratory for testing. The cost of testing will be the responsibility of the animal owner, if known.
(Code 2000, § 18-132; Ord. of 5-1-2000(2), § 9-3-58)
Sec. 10-103. - Management of animals exposed to rabies.
(a)
Generally. Any animal bitten or scratched by a bat or wild carnivorous mammal (particularly a bobcat, raccoon, fox, skunk or coyote) which is not available for testing should be considered exposed to rabies.
(b)
Unvaccinated dogs and cats exposed to rabies. Unvaccinated or unwanted dogs and cats bitten or scratched by a known or potentially rabid animal should be humanely euthanized immediately. If the owner of the animal is unwilling to have this done (upon approval of the department head of the county health department and the city), the exposed animal must be placed in strict isolation for six months and vaccinated one month prior to being released. The responsibility for isolation of an exposed, unvaccinated animal remains with the owner. The animal must be kept in a pen that has been built to the specifications of the state Rabies Control Manual Appendix "C," and approved by the department head of the county health department and the city. Additionally, a second fence 18 to 24 inches in distance from the inner pen must be erected around the perimeter to guarantee complete isolation of the quarantined animal from other animals and human contact. The total construction costs of this confinement area is the sole responsibility of the pet owner. Previously vaccinated dogs and cats whose rabies vaccination has lapsed for more than 30 days are considered unvaccinated and will be treated as such.
(c)
Vaccinated dogs and cats exposed to rabies. Dogs and cats that are currently vaccinated (vaccinated at least one month prior to exposure) and have been bitten by a rabid animal should be revaccinated immediately, confined and observed for 45 days. Confinement must be coordinated with and approved by the county health department.
(d)
Livestock exposed to rabies.

Aggressively attacks in a manner that causes a person to reasonably believe that the dog posed an imminent threat of serious injury to such person or another person, although no such injury occurs; provided, however, that the acts of barking, growling, or showing of teeth by a dog shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subsection; or
