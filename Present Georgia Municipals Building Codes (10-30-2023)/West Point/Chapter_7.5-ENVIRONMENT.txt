ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 7.5-1. - Purpose.
The intent of this chapter is to establish minimum development standards and criteria which will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout the city. Based on the findings of the city comprehensive plan, it has been determined the wise management of these resources as defined in this ordinance is essential to maintaining the health, safety, general welfare and economic well being of the public.
(Ord. of 3-22-01)
Sec. 7.5-2. - Establishment of water resource districts.
The water resource districts shall include the following:
Groundwater recharge area district
Water supply watershed district
River corridor protection district
The boundaries of these water resource districts are shown on a set of maps designed as "water resource districts" and are included as part of this chapter which is on file with the city administrator's office located at 730 First Avenue, West Point, Georgia.
(Ord. of 3-22-01)
Sec. 7.5-3. - Definitions.
In addition to the definitions provided elsewhere in this chapter, the following definitions shall apply to all water resource districts except river corridor protection district:
Aquifer. Any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Buffer. A natural or enhanced vegetated area with no or limited minor land disturbances, such as trails and picnic areas, located adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed or river corridor.
Corridor. All land within the buffer areas established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed and within other setbacks located elsewhere in this chapter.
DRASTIC. The standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. The DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility.
Hazardous waste. Any solid waste, by reason of its toxic, caustic, corrosive, abrasive, or otherwise injurious properties, may be detrimental to the health of any person handling or otherwise coming into contact with such material or substance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has developed a list of hazardous wastes based upon corrosivity, reactivity and toxicity.
Impervious surface. A manmade structure or surface preventing the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools or patios.
Large water supply watershed. A watershed containing more than one hundred (100) square miles of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake.
Perennial stream. A stream that flows throughout the whole year as indicated on United States Geological Survey (USGS) quadrangle map.
Pollution susceptibility. The relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area.
Pollution susceptibility maps. Maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources, using the DRASTIC methodology. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium and low ground water pollution potential.
Recharge area. Any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
Regulated activity. Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act.
Reservoir boundary. The edge of a water supply reservoir defined by its normal pool level.
River/stream bank. The rising ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow.
Significant recharge area. Those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1998 Edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type, thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. Significant recharge areas are as follows in the various geologic provinces of Georgia:
In the Piedmont and in the Blue Ridge, rocks have little primary porosity, with most groundwater being stored in the overlying soils. The significant recharge [areas] are those with thicker soils. Field mapping indicates thick soils in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge are characterized by a density of two (2) or more geologic contacts per four (4) square miles (source: 1976 1:500,000 Geologic Map of Georgia) and slopes lower than eight (8) percent.
Utility. Public, private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government.
Water supply reservoir. A governmentally owned impoundment of water for the primary purpose of providing water to one or more governmentally owned public drinking water systems. This excludes the multipurpose reservoirs owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

ARTICLE II. - WATER RESOURCE DISTRICTS
DIVISION 1. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA DISTRICT

Sec. 7.5-25. - Findings of fact.
Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
(Ord. of 3-22-01)
Sec. 7.5-26. - Purpose.
The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.
(Ord. of 3-22-01)
Sec. 7.5-27. - District delineation.
The groundwater recharge area districts are hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Most Significant Recharge Areas of Georgia, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 Edition).

DIVISION 2. - WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED DISTRICT

Sec. 7.5-40. - Findings of fact.
In order to provide for the health, safety, welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated, expensive and rendering water resources unusable. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby drinking water supplies.
(Ord. of 3-22-01)
Sec. 7.5-41. - Purpose.
The purpose of this division of the water resource district chapter is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply for the city which will minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, and maintain the yield of the water supply watersheds. This division shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the city.
(Ord. of 3-22-01)
Sec. 7.5-42. - District delineation.
The water supply watershed districts are hereby designated, and shall comprise the land areas which drain to the city water supply intake. The boundaries of these districts are defined by the ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius seven (7) miles upstream of the respective water supply intake. These districts shall be further delineated and defined on the water resource district map of the city, which is hereby incorporated and made a part of this chapter by reference.
The following water supply watershed district is hereby defined and boundaries shall be identified on the water resource district map:
The West Point Water Supply Watershed is a large water supply watershed. An intake for the city is located on the Chattahoochee River. This water supply watershed does not contain a reservoir.
(Ord. of 3-22-01)
Sec. 7.5-43. - Permitted uses.
The following regulations shall apply to the West Point Water Supply Watershed identified on the water resource districts map as a large water supply watershed without a reservoir. Uses which are lawful at the time of adoption of this chapter shall be allowed to continue as lawful land uses until such time as the use is abandoned. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts as established by this chapter are permitted in the water supply watershed district, subject to the following standards:
New facilities which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and amounts of ten thousand (10,000) pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements of the Standard Fire Prevention Code.
(Ord. of 3-22-01)
Sec. 7.5-44. - Exemptions.

DIVISION 3. - RIVER CORRIDOR PROTECTION

Sec. 7.5-60. - Findings of fact.
River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in Georgia. These corridors are of vital importance to Georgia by helping to preserve the qualities which make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation and a source of clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation and help absorb floodwaters.
(Ord. of 3-22-01)
Sec. 7.5-61. - Purpose.
The Chattahoochee River has been designated as a protected river by the state. The purpose of this division is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Chattahoochee River as defined herein.
(Ord. of 3-22-01)
Sec. 7.5-62. - Definitions.
Hazardous waste. Any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal Act, which are in force and effective on February 1, 1998, codified as 40 C.F.R. section 261.3. (Note: this is the same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.)
Land-disturbing activity. Any grading, scraping, excavating, filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding or alteration of a structure. Land-disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling and the cutting of firewood for personal use.
Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area. A river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural flora for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "The Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species.
Perennial river. A river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year.
Port facility. Any facility for the docking, loading and unloading of ships.
Protected river. Any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least four hundred (400) cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. However, those segments of river covered by the Metropolitan River Protection Act or Coastal Marshlands Protection Act are specifically excluded from the definition of a protected river. In coastal areas, the seaward limit of any protected river shall be the inland limits of the jurisdiction of the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act.
Public utility or utilities. A service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such service or services and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services.

The one-hundred-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the riverbanks, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured one-hundred-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection district.
Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, riverbank erosion and jumping of channels, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the city/county comprehensive plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river corridor after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next comprehensive plan review by the department of community affairs.
Sensitive natural area. Any area, as defined now or hereafter by the department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following:
1.
Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species;
2.
