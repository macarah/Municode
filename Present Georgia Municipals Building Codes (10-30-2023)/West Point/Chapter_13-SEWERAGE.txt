Sec. 13-4. - Purpose and policy.
This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the sewage works for the City of West Point and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 C.F.R. part 403 et seq.). The objectives of this chapter are:
(1)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the sewage works that will interfere with its operation, and to prevent the introduction into the POTW of any pollutant or hazardous substance which causes personal injury or property damage or, other than in compliance with all local requirements or permits, which causes such sewage works to violate any effluent limitation or condition in any permit issued to the sewage works;
(2)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the sewage works that will pass through the sewage works inadequately treated into receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with the sewage works;
(3)
To protect human health, safety and the environment, including protection of sewage works personnel who may be affected by wastewater in the course of their employment and the general public;
(4)
To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance, and improvement of the sewage works; and
(5)
To enable the City of West Point to comply with its National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit conditions, disposal requirements, and any other applicable federal or state laws.
This chapter shall apply to all users of the sewage works of the City of West Point. The chapter authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits, provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities, establishes administrative review procedures, requires user reporting, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.
(Ord. No. 14-6, § 1, 4-14-14)
Sec. 13-5. - Administration.

(i)
No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment subject to payment thereof in accordance with the city's high strength wastewater surcharge.
(j)
Users discharging "high strength" wastewater into the city's sewerage system can be assessed a monetary surcharge in addition to the normally required sewer use charges in an amount to be calculated below:
When the concentration of the surcharge parameters exceeds the values listed in section 13-36(c)5 and 13.36(g), the excess concentration may be subject to a surcharge according to the following formula:
Surcharge $ month = P*Q*8.34*C
Where "P" is the excess monthly concentration, concentration in mg/l of the parameters (BOD5, etc.) being evaluated (i.e. the actual concentration less the allowable concentration listed in section 13-36(c)5 and 13-36(g):
"Q" is equal to the user's monthly flow in millions of gallons.
"C" is equal to the unit cost in dollars per pound ($ / lb) for the treatment of the surcharged parameter. This value shall be established by the city based on actual wastewater treatment costs which shall be revised from time to time as necessary.
Monitoring to determine surcharge shall be conducted by the user as required in a pretreatment permit or a minimum of two (2) tests per month. The average of all test results provided by an independent laboratory (if requested by the city) will be used to calculate the surcharge.
In addition to the two tests per month, the city reserves the right to sample the user as often as desired at the city's expense. All sampling shall be using flow proportioned composite collection techniques and shall be tested and determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater." Wastewater surcharges will be included in the user's regular water and sewer bill or a separate wastewater surcharge bill.
