APPENDIX E - URBAN DESIGN DISTRICT (CENTRAL AREA)
INTRODUCTION
Using Smyrna's Urban Design Standards
This document contains standards for new construction, building rehabilitation and public improvements within the Downtown Design District overlay zone that has been adopted by the City of Smyrna to encourage the orderly development within and along the edges of its Central Business District and to promote compatibility with the Future Land Use Plan. The Urban Design Standards are supplementary to the City of Smyrna's Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Sign Ordinance, Subdivision Regulations, and Landscape Ordinance. They are intended to inter-relate with Urban Design Guidelines adopted for other sections of the City such as the South Atlanta Road Corridor and Spring Road Corridor. These Standards apply only to exterior features that affect the quality of the public environment. Interior features and land uses are not a concern of the Urban Design Commission.
The format of the Urban Design Standards are designed to provide the property owner, builder or developer a clear description of the criteria utilized for review by the Urban Design Commission. Graphic illustrations of the design standards are provided in this document. A Check List is provided at the end of the Introduction Section with which to evaluate the proposed project prior to submittal for review. The Applicant should thoroughly read the detailed standards that are found in the specific sections of the document. If there are any questions, the Applicant should contact the Community Development Department at 770-319-5387.
Downtown Smyrna: Historical and Future Development Trends
Smyrna's origins go back to 1832 when members of several denominations held camp meetings on a site near the intersection of modern day Spring Street and Atlanta Road. A Methodist Church was organized from this campground in 1838. Western & Atlantic Railroad built through the site in 1842, and the rail stop was first known as Ruffs Siding and then later as Varner's Station. Eventually, the community decided to name itself Smyrna after the Smyrna Methodist Church located near the village center.
The railroad attracted new residents and buildings to Smyrna. In 1850 a two-story brick school for boys, known as the Smyrna Academy, was erected on the present site of the Masonic Lodge. It was the only structure in the village center to survive the Civil War. Smyrna was incorporated as a town in 1872, and benefited from the Northwest Georgia cotton boom in the late 1800s.
However, just when much of the region's economy began to collapse in the 1890s due to low cotton prices, plans were announced to build the Atlanta & Marietta Electric Railway. It was the trolley car that set the pattern of Smyrna's development. Houses and shops clustered within walking distance of the trolley stops. The typical commercial building was a one-story brick structure catering to the needs of the local population. Beyond walking distance, the development density was rural in character. Throughout the early twentieth century Smyrna evolved into a prosperous suburban "bedroom town" for Atlanta. Residents could live in what was then the country, and take a 20-to-45-minute ride to work into Atlanta. The trolley cars continued operation until shortly after World War II.
Since World War II, Smyrna's fortunes have been increasingly tied to regional and national conditions. The closure of the nearby Bell Bomber plant after World War II initiated a period of economic stagnation. The plant's reopening in the early 1950s as a Lockheed plant brought prosperity back again. During the late 1950s Belmont Hills Shopping Center opened with the largest parking lot in the Southeast. In the 1960s a larger South Cobb Mall took commercial preeminence in the county. In the 1970s Cumberland Mall became the largest commercial center in the area. Throughout this time Downtown Smyrna's retail functions shifted to these shopping centers, and the Downtown primarily became a place of local government services.
Throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the traditional downtown of Smyrna steadily shrank as brick buildings were demolished for roads, parking lots and speculative real estate. The economic functions of the "downtown" deteriorated to the level of insignificance. Meanwhile, the population and economic base of Smyrna grew stronger, creating demands for improved public facilities and services. In 1987, a 17-member citizen advisory committee recommended that the top recreational priority in Smyrna was the development of a community center. In June 1987, a "Library Building Needs Study" established a 20-Year Building Plan requiring a new library.
The City Council took the bold step of proposing an innovative Community Center Complex as the heart of a revitalized center. Smyrna's Downtown Development Authority worked on the project throughout the early and mid-1990s. The finished Community Center Complex has received praise from municipal officials and planners from around the country. The park-like setting of the Community Center Complex provides an attractive location for innovative housing, shops and offices. Smyrna's citizens now pride themselves on this attractive and "user friendly" example of architecture and urban design.
Today the strategy of the City of Smyrna is to utilize public investment and leadership as a magnet for private investment in the downtown area. Increasing gridlock on Atlanta's road system is encouraging employers and employees to seek situations with reduced drive times. Smyrna is strategically located for rapid access to many commercial centers within the Atlanta Region. Therefore, downtown Smyrna is an ideal candidate for continued progressive real estate projects that capitalize on the city's amenities and proximity to housing, shops and employment.
Downtown Development and New Urban Design Standards
The Smyrna Downtown Development Authority (DDA) is composed of seven citizens appointed by the Mayor and City Council. The seven members contribute a variety of backgrounds and expertise, while the Mayor serves as chairman. Smyrna's DDA has the power to issue revenue bonds, purchase land, construct public buildings and lease them back to the municipal government. Concerned about the quality of development in Smyrna's downtown, the DDA formed a "Downtown Design Committee" to prepare architectural design guidelines for the Central Business District. After review by citizens and City Council, the guidelines were refined and an ordinance creating two overlay land use control zones was adopted. An Architectural Design Committee (ADC) was then created in 1991 to review proposed projects.
In 1996, the Mayor and City Council commissioned a Citizen Attitude Survey to gauge voter preferences on a variety of issues relating to future development of the city. Citizens were supportive of the lushly landscaped, pedestrian oriented plan of the Community Center Complex, and preferred this approach to either re-creation of a traditional downtown or development that resembled a typical Atlanta Area Office Park. Survey participants were also supportive of the city's continued efforts to improve the appearance and economic vitality of the road corridors and neighborhood businesses leading into Downtown Smyrna.
The City's leaders responded to citizens' concerns and developed urban design guidelines for its major thoroughfares. The guidelines were adopted in 1997 and 1998. It was also recognized that the existing Architectural Design Guidelines needed revision. Its criteria did not reflect the development of the Community Center Complex, and the desire of the citizenry to encourage the new downtown to be developed along this theme. The criteria was streamlined in 1998 to facilitate interpretation by laymen and City Officials, and the name of the ADC was changed to the Urban Design Commission (UDC) to more accurately reflect the review body's role.
The Smyrna Town Center Livable Centers Initiative (LCI) study was completed and adopted in 2004. The LCI program encourages the creation of higher density community activity centers tied together with pedestrian and bike-friendly transportation facilities. The study recommended expanding the mixed-use concept of the Market Village along Atlanta Road from Concord Road to Windy Hill Road. In order to encourage the redevelopment of the Atlanta Road corridor, the City created the 140-acre Smyrna Tax Allocation District One - Atlanta Road. The district allows the utilization of tax increment financing to offset costs associated with redevelopment. In addition, the City of Smyrna has refined architectural design and site plan requirements and created a new Downtown Design District that corresponds with the tax allocation district boundary.
Boundaries for Downtown Design District
The City of Smyrna has adopted, under its police powers, an "overlay" zoning district, now known as the Downtown Design District. The abbreviated reference to this special regulatory district is the DD District. The DD District follows the same boundaries as the designated Tax Allocation District One - Atlanta Road. The DD District requirements are in addition to the zoning requirements outlined in the City's Zoning Ordinance. The boundaries of the DD District are generally described as CSX Railroad on the east, Spring Road and Concord Road on the south, City Center and the western property line of the Carriage House Apartments on the west, and properties fronting the northern side of Windy Hill Road on the north.
Beginning at the intersection of the northern right-of-way of Windy Hill Road and the western right-of-way of CSX Rail line, also known as the eastern right-of-way of Atlanta Road, proceed southerly along the western right-of-way of CSX Rail line to the southern property line of Parcel 17055900750; thence westerly along the property line of Parcel 17055900750 to the property line of Parcel 17055900620; thence southerly to the southern right-of-way of Spring Road; thence westerly along the southern right-of-way of Spring Road and Concord Road to the western right-of-way of King Street; thence northerly along the western right-of-way of King Street to the southern right-of-way of Church Street; thence westerly along the southern right-of-way of Church Street to the property line of Parcel 17052200780; thence westerly along the southern right-of-way of Church Street to the western right-of-way of Reed Street; thence northerly along the western right-of-way of Reed Street to the northern right-of-way of Stephens Street; thence easterly along the northern right-of-way of Stephens Street to the western border of the City of Smyrna parking lot on Parcel 17052200120; thence northerly along the western border of the City parking lot and then easterly along the northern border of the City parking lot to the western border of the Village Walk roadway; thence northerly along the western border of the Village Walk roadway to the southern right-of-way of Bank Street; thence easterly along the northern property line of Parcel 17052100710; thence northerly and westerly along the property lines of Parcels 17052101260 and 17052101250 to the southern right-of-way of Powder Springs Street; thence westerly to the western right-of-way of Fuller Street; thence northerly along the western right-of-way of Fuller Street to the property line of Parcel 1705200660; then northerly along the western property line of Parcel 1705200660 to its northern property line; thence easterly along the northern property lines of Parcels 1705200660 and 1705200670 to the property line of Parcel 1705200290; thence northerly along the western property line of Parcel 1705200290 to the property line of Parcel 1705200310; thence easterly along the property line of Parcel 1705200290 to the property line of Parcel 17052000320; thence northerly along the property lines of Parcels 1705200320 and 1705200340; thence easterly along the property line of Parcel 1705200340 to the property line of Parcel 1705200360; thence northerly along the property lines of Parcels 1705200360 and 1705200600 to the southern right-of-way of Hill Street; then westerly along the southern right-of-way of Hill Street to the western property line of Parcel 1705200130; then northerly along the western property lines of Parcels 1705200110 and 1705200100 to the southern right-of-way of Fleming Street; then westerly along the southern right-of-way of Fleming Street to the eastern property line of Parcel 17044800030; thence northerly along the eastern property lines of Parcels 17044800020 and 17044800010, such parcels being Campbell High School, to the southern property line of Parcel 17044700030; thence westerly along the southern property lines of Parcels 17044700030, 17041800030, and 17041800010 to the western property line of Parcel 17041800010; thence northerly along the western property lines of Parcels 17041800010 and 17041800040 to the northern right-of-way of Windy Hill Road; thence westerly along Windy Hill Road to the western property line of Parcel 17041900920; thence northerly along the western property line of Parcel 17041900920 to its northern border; thence easterly along the northern borders of Parcels 17041900920, 17041900900, 17041900910, 17041900550, 17041900560, 17041900130, 17041900120, 17041900110, 17041900010, 17041900880, 17044600190, 17044600620, 17044600590, 17044600180, 17044600140, 17044600610, 17044600600, 17044600130, 17044600630, and 17044600120 to the western property line of Parcel 17049100270; thence easterly along the northern property line of Parcel 17049100270 to the western right-of-way of Atlanta Road; then across Atlanta Road to the eastern right-of-way of Atlanta Road, also known as the western right-of-way of CSX Rail line; then southerly to the intersection of the western right-of-way of CSX Rail line with the northern right-of-way of Windy Hill Road, and Point of Beginning.

ARTICLE I. - APPLICATION OF URBAN DESIGN STANDARDS

Sec. 1.0 - Procedures.
(a)
1.01 Background.
New construction will be the predominate type of development activity in northern Smyrna. Much of the city's original downtown was demolished in the 1960s and 1970s, to the extent that Smyrna ceased to have a true downtown. The city has begun a process to create a new downtown that embodies both the efficiency of contemporary architecture with the amenities and people scale of traditional town planning. The intent of these standards is to guide new construction as well as the renovation of existing buildings toward a future urban environment where the buildings and infrastructure are both compatible with each other and the lifestyles of Smyrna's citizens.
Few older buildings (50+ years) remain in the central Smyrna area. For this reason, it is important to preserve those remaining historical buildings that reflect the history, character and architecture of Smyrna's past. The overriding recommendations of Article III are to restore and maintain the older buildings as close as possible to their original appearance.
(b)
1.02 Urban Design Commission.
The regulatory body designated to review applications for zoning, land disturbance, building and sign permits in the Downtown Design District shall be known as the Smyrna Urban Design Commission (UDC). The UDC shall also be responsible for reviewing any public or private plans affecting downtown Smyrna, as directed by the Mayor and City Council. It shall be composed of all members of the Downtown Development Authority, plus two members appointed by the Authority, who have expertise in architectural fields. The UDC shall meet in public at least once a month and be authorized to adopt a Rules of Order for the operation of its meetings. An employee of the City of Smyrna shall attend all UDC meetings, take minutes at all meetings and maintain a public record of all minutes and actions.
(c)
1.03 Applicability.
In order to assure the orderly growth and compatible development of central Smyrna, the Mayor and City Council have adopted these Urban Design Standards as a mandatory land use control for all properties and structures within its defined jurisdiction (See Boundary Map). These standards supplement and are adjunct to Smyrna's Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Sign Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance and the Standard Building Code. When conflicts occur between requirements of these various regulatory documents, the most strenuous standard applies, as interpreted by a City of Smyrna Building Inspection Official.
Existing buildings which are less than 50 years old and which possess no distinguishing architectural merit may be maintained, demolished or renovated. If a building of this type is renovated or replaced with a new building, the new structure or renovation shall comply with Article II. If a building 50 years old or older is renovated, it shall follow the design criteria in Article III and shall be considered a preservation project. Renovations, which include painting and new construction in the Downtown Design District, must be submitted to the UDC.
(d)
1.04 Thresholds for Review by Urban Design Commission.
(1)
1.04.1 New Construction.
Design review is required for all new construction within the Downtown Design District. Plan submittal is required for buildings built on vacant lots or for the replacement of demolished buildings.
(2)
1.04.2 Building Renovation.
If your project is routine maintenance as hereunder described, it does not require design review:
Routine Maintenance—Includes cleaning building exterior and property; replacing deteriorated materials that compose less than 24 percent of the building's exterior; painting, provided the paint colors have been previously approved by the Urban Design Commission.
If your project is one of the following categories as hereunder described, it requires design review by the Urban Design Commission:
Major Renovation—Includes building addition, canopy or replacement of 25 percent or more of a building. Painting will require review if the color has not been previously approved by the Urban Design Commission.
Landscaping—A landscaping plan is required to screen parking facilities and meet tree ordinance
Parking—A plan for meeting the parking requirements associated with new building construction is subject to design review.
Demolition—Design review required if building is 50 years or older. Request for demolition permit must be submitted to the Urban Design Commission accompanied by a plan for a replacement building.
(e)
1.05 Application Procedure.
An Application for a Certificate of Approval must be submitted to the UDC in order for it to take formal action on a proposed project. However, it is recommended that the applicant first submit conceptual design drawings of the proposed project to the Smyrna Community Development Department for informal review, prior to being submitted to the UDC. This will help prevent expenditures of financial resources for changes to construction documents. Conceptual drawings may take the form of dimensioned sketches or may be more refined. However, the graphics should provide sufficient information so the City Staff may determine if there are obvious conflicts with applicable codes and regulations.
In addition to an application for a Certificate of Approval, standard applications (as applicable) for zoning changes, ground disturbance permits, sign permits and building permits must be submitted for proposed projects in the Downtown Design District. All applications for zoning changes, demolition permits, sign permits, ground disturbance permits and building permits within the boundaries of the Downtown Design District shall clearly state so. Applications shall be submitted to the Smyrna Community Development Department within 15 days prior to a scheduled meeting of the UDC. The Applicant will be invited to present the project at the public meeting and will be allowed to amend the application at that meeting in response to concerns addressed by the UDC. All amendments and stipulations to an approved application shall be attached in writing to the application and signed by the applicant and the Chairman of the UDC.
Applications denied by the UDC may be redrawn and re-submitted to the UDC for another public review. Final approval of a proposed project will be verified by the issuance of a Certificate of Approval and a City of Smyrna Building/Zoning/Sign/Ground Disturbance Permit. Any significant deviation which is not in compliance with the city's codes and ordinances shall be sufficient grounds for the Community Development Department to issue a Stop Work Order on the project and possibly make the property owner, general contractor and/or developer subject to civil penalties or judicial action.
(f)
1.06 Variance Procedure.
The Urban Design Commission may grant design exceptions if a proposed project is a unique and exceptional design concept that architecturally enhances the downtown area. Once a design exception is granted by the Urban Design Commission the applicant must seek approval from the license and variance board through the provisions of Article XIV of the Zoning Ordinance.
(g)
1.07 Appeals Procedure.
If the UDC denies an application, the applicant may follow normal appeals procedures. The applicant may file an appeal to the Mayor and City Council. At its discretion, the City Council may accept this appeal and schedule a Public Hearing to hear public arguments on the matter. If the applicant is still not satisfied with the findings of the regulatory bodies within the City of Smyrna, he or she may seek judicial review within the State Court System.
(h)
1.08 Definitions.
Except as specifically defined herein, all words used in this ordinance have their customary dictionary definitions. For the purposes of this ordinance, certain words and terms used herein shall be defined as follows:
Architraves—molding around a door or window
Cornice—a horizontal molded projection that crowns or completes a building or wall.
Fenestration—the arrangement of windows in a building
Landscape zones—shall be minimum 5 feet in width and located immediately adjacent to the curb and shall be continuous. This zone may be used for street trees, streetlights, benches, planters, trash receptacles, bicycle parking racks and other street furniture, pedestrian lights, landscaping, or sod.
Lunette—A crescent-shaped or semicircular space, usually over a door or window that may contain another window, a sculpture, or a mural.
Parapet—a low protective wall or railing along the edge of a raised structure such as a roof or balcony.
Muntins/mullions—a strip of wood or metal separating and supporting and holding panes of glass in a window or panels set in series.
Sidewalk clear zones—shall be 10 feet in width and located immediately contiguous to the landscape zone and shall be continuous. Said zone shall be unobstructed for a minimum height of eight feet.
Transom window/panel—a small window or panel above a door that is usually hinged to a horizontal crosspiece over the door.
(Ord. No. 2008-14, 8-18-08; Ord. No. 2021-08 , 4-19-21; Ord. No. 2021-13 , 7-6-21)
ARTICLE II. - NEW CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS

Sec. 2.0 - New construction design criteria.
(a)
2.01 Background.
Buildings in downtown Smyrna erected during the late 19th and early 20th centuries were typically one or two story brick structures with simplified classical details such as decorative cornices, pilasters, large display windows, decorative window surrounds, and ornate brick or iron storefronts. Commercial structures were typically adjacent to the sidewalk and neighboring buildings. Mid-20th century commercial buildings in Smyrna had simpler facades and varied more in building height, but still tended to be erected adjacent to property lines. Throughout the United States these periods of architecture symbolize "downtown" in the minds of most citizens and Smyrna requires these design elements to be incorporated into new construction in the Downtown Design District. The goal of the Urban Design Standards is to create unique, well-designed building facades that will remain viable in the future and ensure the economic stability of the downtown area for future generations.
(Ord. No. 2008-14, 8-18-08)
Sec. 2.1 - Site design standards.
(a)
2.11 Building Scale and Massing.
(1)
2.11.1 Background.
The use of smaller scale building components reduces the perceived scale of large buildings, and maintains the sense of people scale in a downtown. Variations in building mass enhance the visual image of the downtown by creating architectural interest and vitality. A simple long wall is not permitted in the Downtown Design District.
(2)
2.11.2 Design Criteria.
a.
Discontinuous building massing for large buildings: Buildings shall reduce their perceived height and bulk by dividing the building mass into smaller scale components. Building walls exceeding 100 continuous horizontal linear feet shall utilize offsets, such as projections, recesses, and changes in floor level. In addition, any commercial building with primary tenant spaces greater than 50,000 square feet shall be structurally designed to be easily divided into smaller tenant spaces.
b.
Discontinuous building massing for small buildings: Individual buildings may share the same setback for any 100-foot linear span as measured along the curb line. Beyond one hundred 100 linear feet, individual buildings shall setback a minimum of five feet greater or lesser than the adjacent building's setback.
(b)
2.12 Building Setbacks and Lot Sizes.
(1)
2.12.1 Background.
Downtown structures are traditionally located adjacent to sidewalks and neighboring buildings. Buildings located along sidewalks clearly define the street edge. This building placement also creates a pedestrian-friendly atmosphere that entices people to explore and invites them into the buildings.
(2)
2.12.2 Design Criteria.
a.
Non-Residential and Mixed-Use Buildings
(1)
Minimum lot size: none
(2)
Minimum setbacks:
Front—zero

Side—zero
(3)
Maximum setbacks:
Front—20 feet
Side—20 feet
(4)
All new buildings are required to be placed on the edge of a ten-foot wide sidewalk, unless a public plaza, patio or courtyard area is incorporated into the site plan.
(5)
Buildings located on corner lots will be placed adjacent to sidewalks on the two sides of the building that face the public right-of-way.
b.
Single-Family Detached
(1)
Minimum lot size: 6,250 square feet
(2)
Minimum public road frontage: 50 feet.
(3)

(2)
Minimum setbacks:
Front—20 feet (Residences may be built to the edge of the right-of-way if parking/garage located in the rear or detached)
Rear—40 feet
Side—15 feet
(3)
Minimum building separations:
Side to Side—20 feet
Side to Back—30 feet
Back to Back—40 feet
Front to Side—30 feet
Front to Back—40 feet
Front to Front—40 feet
(4)
Front yards shall be landscaped with the exception of terraces, porches, stoops and walkways, which may occupy a maximum of one-half of the front yard area.
(Ord. No. 2008-14, 8-18-08)
(c)
2.13 Building Height.
(1)
2.13.1 Background.
The appearances of individual buildings collectively create the visual image of an entire downtown. Varying building heights in the Downtown Design District will help create a people scale with architectural interest.
(2)
2.13.2 Design Criteria.
a.
Buildings are encouraged to be two or more stories.
b.
No structure shall exceed 66 feet in height.
c.
No structure may exceed 35 feet in height without formal approval of the City Fire Marshall and the Mayor and City Council.

2.14.1 Background.
Today vehicle circulation and parking must be accommodated, while respecting the goal for a friendly pedestrian-oriented downtown. Downtown residents must feel safe walking to the corner store without crossing multiple vehicular driveways. Visitors to the downtown should be able to park once and then safely walk to several destinations. Parking should also be provided and in some cases prioritized for alternative transportation that does not degrade the environment.
(2)
2.14.2 Design Criteria.
a.
The design of all parking facilities shall comply with the provisions of Section 901 of the Zoning Ordinance.
b.
For new buildings, all parking lots are prohibited between the building and public right-of-way.

j.
On-street parking shall be permitted adjacent to the street curb. Said parking shall be parallel or angled parking.
k.
There shall be a pedestrian walkway that is a minimum of ten feet in depth along all buildings for the purpose of allowing pedestrians to walk from the parking facility or parking area to the building in safety. These walkways shall provide planting boxes. Any trees planted in these boxes shall be counted towards the ten percent parking lot landscaping requirement.
l.
All developments shall have pedestrian walkways a minimum width of five feet connecting ground level parking to the public sidewalks and to all building entrances.
m.
Driveways and Curb Cuts:
(1)
Driveways and curb cuts should be limited in both number and size to minimize conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles.
(2)
Driveway curb cuts shall not be permitted on any street that functions as an arterial street or collector street when access may be provided from a side or rear street located immediately adjacent to a contiguous property, with the exception of hotel patron drop-off drives.
(3)
No more than one curb cut shall be permitted for each development, provided that properties with more than one street frontage may have one curb cut located on each street frontage. However, developments on properties with a single street frontage greater than 400 feet shall be permitted two curb cuts along one street frontage.
(4)
Driveway curb cut widths shall be 24 feet for two-way entrances and 12 feet for one-way entrances, unless otherwise permitted by the Smyrna Community Development Department. For the purposes of this section, two curb cuts serving two one-way driveways shall only be counted as one curb cut provided that each curb cut does not exceed fifteen feet width.
(5)
The City Engineer may authorize a common or joint driveway.
(6)
All sidewalk-paving materials shall be continued across any intervening driveway at the same prevailing grade and cross slope as on the adjacent sidewalk clear zone.
n.
Shared or Reduced Parking Standards.
(1)
Reduction of parking requirements through a shared parking arrangement may be permissible only through the approval of the Community Development Department provided the arrangement shall avoid conflicting parking demands and provide for safe pedestrian circulation and access.
(2)
A to-scale map indicating location of proposed parking spaces shall be provided.
(3)
A shared parking calculation projection shall be provided that demonstrates that each use will have adequate parking provisions at all times.
(4)
For contiguous properties sharing parking spaces under this provision, cross-easements shall be filed establishing access to the parking spaces in perpetuity.
(5)
A reduction in the number of parking spaces that would otherwise be required for each of the various uses on a multiple-use property must be clearly shown on the development plan. If shared parking is proposed for a combination of contiguous properties, a plan must be submitted covering all of the properties that will be sharing the parking spaces.
(6)
Location on other property: If the required automobile parking spaces cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, such spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby property, provided a major portion lies within 1,000 feet of the main entrance to the principal use for which such parking is provided, and measured by the most direct route of travel on the ground.
(7)
Off site parking requirements may be met on property owned by the developer or leased by the developer for a minimum of five years.
(8)
A written agreement among all owners of record shall be provided and held on file with the Community Development Department. All renewed or terminated leases shall be filed with the Community Development Department.
(9)
If at any time the building owner fails to meet the required parking space requirements, the city via its staff can revoke the building occupancy permit or business license.
o.
Parking Decks and Parking Structures.
(1)
Parking deck facades shall conceal automobiles from visibility from any public right-of-way, private drive or street that are open to the general public, and shall have the appearance of a horizontal storied building.

Existing floor area in renovated and rehabilitated buildings is exempt from these requirements.
(e)
2.15 Screening.
(1)
2.15.1 Background.
In order to create a pleasant environment for the downtown patron, adequate screening is required to minimize the negative visual and noise impacts of parking lots, storage areas, loading areas and trash receptacle areas.

(f)
2.16 Alleys and Rear Entrances.
(1)
2.16.1 Background.
Alleys and the rears of buildings today function as more than delivery areas. The rears of buildings will often be the main parking area for customers and must provide a pleasant and well-kept appearance. A business may want an additional entrance from the rear of the store to reduce the walking distance for customers. Architectural and landscape elements from other parts of the building should be incorporated into the rear entrance.

(g)
2.17 Open Spaces.
(1)
2.17.1 Background.
Open spaces provide important health and social benefits to a downtown. Open spaces balance the built environment, and ensure adequate sunlight and air circulation within the downtown. Opportunities for alternative transportation and increased connectivity can be achieved when adjoining open spaces are connected. Open spaces create outdoor living rooms for community interaction, and provide areas for relaxation and/or recreation.
(2)
2.17.2 Design Criteria.
a.
Open space shall be required for all development in the equivalent amount of a minimum of 20 percent of the total site area being developed.
b.
Required yards and requirements for sidewalk zones and landscape zones that are constructed on private property may be counted towards this requirement. No more than 35 percent of a combination of the side and rear yards may consist of a concrete, asphalt or gravel driveway or parking area and the remaining percentage shall be grass or landscaped areas.
c.
Open space may also include balconies, roof-top terraces, front yards, planted areas, fountains, parks, plazas, trails and paths, hardscape elements related to sidewalks and plazas, and similar features which are located on private property. Open space shall not include areas devoted to public or private vehicular access.
d.
Open spaces utilizing hardscaping elements shall be prohibited from utilizing asphalt towards these requirements. No more than 25 percent of any hardscaping element may be counted as open space.
e.
All open space must be accessible to the public or to the occupants/users of the provided use. Open space shall be prohibited from being inaccessible or not usable. Elements that are not physically accessible to the public or occupant/users such as public art, water fountains or retaining walls and similar elements are permitted but shall constitute no more than ten percent of the total area of the open space.
f.
When adjacent to the open space of another property, open space shall connect to said adjacent open space and provide a fluid and direct connection to said open space.

(Ord. No. 2008-14, 8-18-08)
Sec. 2.2 - Architectural design standards.
(a)
2.21 Building Materials.
(1)
2.21.1 Background.
The use of quality building materials relating to other established materials found on existing downtown buildings is essential to maintaining a consistent relationship among the downtown structures. Each building should use materials and design that compliment that of its neighbor.
(2)
2.21.2 Design Criteria.
a.
Materials such as imitation brick or stone, rough textured wood siding, aggregate, concrete block, and metal siding are prohibited in the DD District.
b.
Traditional materials such as brick, terra cotta, stucco, and smooth finished stone such as marble, granite, or sand stone shall be used. Four-sided design is required and discontinuity of building materials is prohibited.
c.
In addition to the use of glass for the fenestration requirements of this district, all exterior walls and facades shall be required to use a minimum of two of the following elements: brick, glass, wood, stucco, or stone. No single element shall constitute greater than 80 percent of the total of the elements used.
(b)
2.22 Roofs.
(1)
2.22.1 Background.
The typical late 19th and early 20th century commercial buildings in downtown Smyrna had flat or minimally sloped roofs with parapet walls extending above the roof. During the same era virtually all residential structures had sloped roofs. However, as a design theme to tie all new construction together aesthetically, the City of Smyrna has adopted flat, gabled or hipped standing seam metal roofs as the standard for new construction. Such metal roofs were widespread in the mid-19th century and have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity during the last two decades because of their durability and superior water-shedding capabilities. Decorative roof forms are encouraged.
(2)
2.22.2 Design Criteria.
a.
Commercial buildings shall have flat, gabled or hipped standing seam metal roofs unless the Urban Design Commission gives special permission.
b.
Roof pitches shall range from 6:12 to 10:12.
c.
Architectural grade shingles may be utilized on commercial buildings where appropriate if approved by the Urban Design Commission.
d.
Variation in building rooflines for small buildings: Individual buildings may share the same roofline and roof pitch for any 100-foot linear span as measured along the curb line. Beyond 100 linear feet, individual buildings shall vary the roofline and roof pitch from that of the adjacent building's roofline and roof pitch.
e.
Variation in building rooflines for large buildings: Variation in the roofline of buildings and offsets in pitched roofs and gables shall be required. Parapets in building masses exceeding 100 continuous linear feet shall be varied in height and projection and shall use decorative elements such as crown moldings, dental, brick soldier courses, or similar detail.
(c)
2.23 Storefront Differentiation.
(1)
2.23.1 Background.
Variations in individual storefront designs create architectural interest and will help draw businesses and visitors to the unique downtown area. Storefronts should appear as if they were constructed over a period of time. Storefront differentiation may be accomplished by utilizing a variety of different building materials, paint colors, parapet heights, setbacks, awning types, and window sizes and spacing.
(2)
2.23.2 Design Criteria.
a.
Repetitive, uniformly designed storefronts are not permitted in the Downtown Design District.
b.
Buildings constructed to accommodate more than one tenant shall be designed with substantial architectural differentiation to clearly delineate each individual storefront.
c.
Delineation of building floors at the third story above sidewalk level and lower shall be executed through windows, belt courses, cornice lines or similar architectural detailing.
(d)
2.24 Building Facades.
(1)
2.24.1 Background.
In the downtown area, all building elevations will be visible from public and private streets, sidewalks, parking areas and/or adjacent building. Therefore, all sides of a building are important to the downtown's overall appearance. Building elevations seen by the public are to be made interesting and attractive through the use of windows and architectural features.
(2)
2.24.2 Design Criteria.
a.
Each building elevation shall be fully designed and consistent with the building's primary façade. Discontinuity of building materials or architectural design elements is prohibited.
b.
First floors and street level floors fronting a street or sidewalk shall not have blank walls.
c.
First floor building walls shall have window and door openings of at least 50 percent of its length or one of the other options described below.
(1)
Works of art, fountains and pools, street furniture, landscaping and garden areas, architecturally articulated facades and display areas may also be considered in meeting this requirement.
d.
The length of façade without intervening fenestration or entryway shall not exceed 20 feet.
(e)
2.25 Doors and Windows.
(1)
2.25.1 Background.
The traditional Main Street storefront was composed primarily of glass. When designed properly, doorways and display windows create a visually interesting atmosphere for pedestrian shoppers and showcase retail goods. Fenestration (the arrangement, proportioning, and design of windows and doors) is important to the economic success of a downtown business district.
(2)
2.25.2 Entrance Doors and Architraves.
Entrance doors and architraves (architectural door surrounds and moldings) are critical design elements for a building's facade. Entrance doors provide a sense of entry both visually and physically. Doors should be pronounced and welcoming. They should also be recessed to allow space for opening the door, to provide pedestrians cover and shelter, and to create visual interest. Architraves consist of the door casing or brick molding and the surrounding trim. Architraves may be recessed into the wall plane or applied on top of masonry cladding. Small stock trims and standard metal casings should be avoided. Varying door types and architraves from storefront to storefront will differentiate each facade, giving each shop its own unique character.
(3)
2.25.3 Windows.
The use of mostly glass on the first-floor facade is encouraged today for the same reason as in the past. It allows natural light into the display portion of the building, relieving a closed feeling and making the area more inviting to customers. Transom windows above display windows and raised panels below create architectural interest. Older storefront glass display windows were typically framed by wood molding painted in accent colors.
Transom windows, transom panels and sidelights are traditional design elements that add detail and weight to entrances and display windows. Transom windows may be decorative in nature; they do not need to be functioning windows. When used, transom lights should be placed above the entrance door or display window. They may also be placed above an awning so that the transom remains visible. Sidelights may be all glass or a combination of glass lights and raised panels.
Upper-story windows of downtown buildings create a repeated pattern that ties together all downtown facades. With the exception of multiple-story foyers, fixed pane sashes are prohibited; instead the use of decorative lunette windows, transom windows and Palladian windows are encouraged.
(4)
2.25.4 Design Criteria.
a.
Primary Entrance Orientation:
(1)
Entrances shall be emphasized with architectural details and oriented toward sidewalks and public rights-of-way.
(2)
The primary pedestrian access to all sidewalk level uses and business establishments with public or private street frontage shall be directly accessible and visible from the sidewalk adjacent to such street.
(3)
Buildings on corner lots where two public rights-of-way intersect shall be oriented toward the corner of the lot. Corner entrances shall be pronounced to highlight the building's orientation.
(4)
When parking is situated behind a building, a secondary entrance convenient to the parking lot may be provided; however, the main storefront facade shall be oriented toward the street in order to enhance pedestrian activity in the downtown.
(5)
Street address number shall be located directly above the primary building entrance, shall be clearly visible from the sidewalk and shall be a minimum of six inches in height.
b.
Doors:
(1)
Stock glass doors with metal casings are not permitted.

(f)
2.26 Awnings, Porches & Balconies.
(1)
2.26.1 Background.
The use of awnings, porches and balconies on downtown buildings provide protection from sun, wind and rain, making the downtown shopping experience more enjoyable for the shopper. In addition to protecting the customer from the elements, an awning, canopy or balcony reduces heat gain in the building. An awning also provides an overhead cover to reduce the scale of the sidewalk area to people-size. Balconies that serve all the functions of the awning plus a useful function to the second floor are highly encouraged. Balconies traditionally were part of the building's details.
(2)
2.26.2 Design Criteria.
a.
Canvas, vinyl, and decorative metal awnings are permitted.
b.
Translucent, plastic, and wood awnings are prohibited.
c.
Storefront awnings and canopies shall be a minimum of seven feet to valence, and eight feet to structure. Support poles are prohibited.

e.
The use of plastic sheeting or other temporary dining canopies is not permitted.
f.
Dining canopies are exempt from the maximum size requirements, but all dining canopies must be approved by the Commission,
g.
Upper story balconies hung from exterior walls shall extend no greater than six feet from the building façade.
h.
In no case shall the awning or canopy cover greater than 20 percent of the building facade.
i.
Permanent awnings unique to each storefront shall be used; temporary awnings, tarps, or tents are not permitted.
j.
Balcony railings should be constructed of decorative wood or metal materials.
k.
All colors are allowed, however bright colors tend to fade quickly. If choosing to use bright colors, assume greater maintenance and earlier replacement.
(g)
2.27 Paint Colors.
(1)
2.27.1 Background.
Building color should be carefully chosen so that each building complements that of its neighbor. An entire block of buildings should blend together even though each building will possess its own identity. The main building is usually painted in more subdued earth tones or brick shades and building trim is painted in a decorative manner in a contrasting shade lighter or darker than the main building.
(2)
2.27.2 Design Criteria.
a.
Paint colors shall be selected from the approved palate of Pantone Colors shown in the Smyrna New Business Information brochure.
b.
For purposes of the design review the colors are classified by the following categories:
Base Color—Used on the majority of building surface.
Trim Color—Used on window trim, fascia, balustrades and posts.
Accent Color—Used on signs, awnings and door only.
c.
A building's colors shall complement its neighbors, but shall not duplicate the same color scheme of an adjacent building.
d.
The Urban Design Commission may grant exceptions to the approved color palate if desired colors meet the intent and goals of the Commission.
(h)
2.28 Lighting.
(1)
2.28.1 Background.
The display window lighting should be the dominant element. The other elements of the building should have a more subdued lighting. The lighting shall be indirect from either concealed fixtures or from decorative light fixtures in keeping with the style of the building. Lighting in the parking lots and areas of pedestrian circulation shall be sufficient to avoid dark areas and provide light levels adequate for safety.
(2)
2.28.2 Design Criteria.
a.
The street lighting fixture provided by Georgia Power that emulates historical gaslights is the standard fixture for the downtown area or a similar, equivalent product.
b.
Lighting shall be sufficient to provide for safety along sidewalks and parking areas for customers.
c.
Storefronts shall utilize building mounted lighting to uplight any building mounted signage including addresses and businesses name. Lighting shall be painted utilizing the colors listed in the Smyrna New Business Information brochure.
(i)
2.29 Fencing.
(1)
2.29.1 Background.
Fencing should be carefully chosen so that it complements that of its neighbor. Fencing should be decorative in nature to provide visual interest to the downtown. Traditional materials such as wood, wrought iron, brick and stone shall be used. Fencing and low courtyard walls can provide street edge definition, but should not obstruct pedestrian views.
(2)
2.29.2 Design Criteria.
a.
No barbed wire, razor wire, chain link fence or similar elements shall be visible from any public plaza, ground level or sidewalk level outdoor dining area or public right-of-way.
b.
Fencing within front yards of all zoning districts shall be a decorative or ornamental rail, split rail, picket, opaque, basket weave, or similar constructed of wood materials or wrought iron provided that said fence does not exceed four feet in height. Columns comprised of brick, stone, or similar material may be placed between fence sections.
c.
A courtyard or patio wall comprised of brick or stone may be constructed along the street-facing façade adjacent to the sidewalk provided said wall is between 32" and 40" in height.
(j)
2.210 Signs.
(1)
2.210.1 Background.
Signs are an integral part of the downtown facade and image. A business sign can call attention to a store and create an individual image. Merchants often try to "out do" each other with large flashy signs. However, bigger signs are not better in a city's downtown. In the DD District smaller, high quality, pedestrian oriented signs that are integrated with the building are required.
(2)
2.210.2 Design Criteria.
a.
Requirements of the current Smyrna Sign Ordinance apply.
b.
Wood signs and signs which give the appearances of wood are required unless the Urban Design Commission gives special approval.
c.
Freestanding signs shall be permitted only upon approval of the Urban Design Commission.
d.
Signs shall be lit indirectly and not backlit.

ARTICLE IV. - PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS

Sec. 4.0 - Public improvements.
(a)
4.01 Background.
In Articles II and III, the streetscape has been concerned with the private sector improvements. The goal of the design standards for private sector buildings was to outline a uniform level of quality in materials and buildings that relate in color, height and horizontal rhythms of adjacent buildings. It is just as important to the streetscape that public improvements be consistent and uniform throughout the downtown area. Items such as light poles, landscaping, street benches, trash receptacles, tree grates and decorative paving strips all help create an attractive, uniform appearance. The purpose of the following items in this article is to explain and illustrate good streetscape design by using unifying improvements in public right-of-ways and applies to work by either private or public sectors. The private sector is expected to follow the design standards of this section by installing the outlined public improvements that are not already in place at the time of building construction or renovation.

4.11.1 Background.
Street trees and shrubbery break up the monotony of concrete and asphalt in a downtown area by providing greenery and pleasant vistas. The "downtown center park" provides a focus and an oasis in the midst of the hustle and bustle of downtown life. Street trees reduce the impact of the sun on sidewalk areas and storefronts. They provide shade and create a place to stop and browse in comfort, promoting pedestrian traffic and encouraging pedestrians to stay longer. Tree canopies also serve the same function as awnings and overhangs. Trees help reduce the scale of buildings and the street to a people size pathway along the sidewalk.
Street trees are required along the sidewalks in the DD District. Due to the difficult growing conditions for downtown trees, it is important to give them a good start and use species which are well adapted for these conditions. Street trees for purposes of downtown Smyrna will be divided into two types. The first type is called the "overhead canopy tree" which is the larger of the two types and will be used most often along sidewalks or in street medians. These trees provide sufficient space for pedestrian movement under them. The second type of street tree is called "intermediate focus trees" and are smaller trees used more for screening blank walls or storage sheds, or may serve as a focal point in a small urban park.
In addition to the need for street trees downtown, there is also a need to use shrubs. Shrubs not only add color and texture to a streetscape, but shrubs can also provide excellent screening to hide blank walls, unattractive foundations, parking lots, trash bins, loading docks and outside storage areas.
OVERHEAD CANOPY TREES
• Establish a unifying element in a streetscape or corridor theme.
• Soften the hard architectural environment.
• Most effective when used in medians (as street trees), urban open space and urban parks.
• Has greatest impact on microclimate and pedestrian comfort providing shade, windbreaks and filtering pollution.
INTERMEDIATE FOCUS TREES
• Provide an understory to the overhead canopy trees.
• Establish an effective screen for less attractive architectural or site elements.
• Define or emphasize a major or minor space such as an entry area to a building, park or urban plaza.
• Serve as an accent or focal point.
SHRUBS
• Establish eye level pedestrian scale.
• Defines major and minor spaces and directs pedestrian traffic.
• Aids in softening edges between architectural fencing, walls and other vertical elements and the ground lane.
• Establish opaque screen for less attractive site elements and building foundations.
• Adds texture, color and variety to all situations.
GROUND COVER
• Can be used in lieu of grass to provide a low maintenance soil cover.
• Effective as a soil stabilizer for erosion control.
• Many species can adapt to difficult areas such as shady corners, steep banks and areas with poor drainage.
• Add a variety of texture (and sometime cover) to the ground plane.
• Effective when used to define a border or edge and as a foreground plant.

j.
Developers planting street trees on public property shall guarantee them for a full growing season (one year).
(b)
4.12 Lighting & Street Furniture.
(1)
4.12.1 Background.
Lighting can make a difference in the image of downtown. A well lit downtown gives the feeling of a safe area in which to visit and shop. Lighting should serve both the vehicular circulation, which requires lighting on taller poles and projection over streets, and pedestrian circulation that requires more decorative and smaller streetlights along the sidewalks and parking areas. The consistent use of uniform lighting fixtures throughout downtown helps to unify the area and give a sense of place. Street light fixtures along with other uniform street furniture lets the downtown shopper know when they have entered that unique area known as "downtown".
Street furniture serves the same unifying purpose in the downtown as does street light fixtures. Street furniture transforms downtown sidewalks and parks into people places. Street furniture should conform to the same style and should be placed in areas of pedestrian activity. Street benches should be comfortable, structurally sound but simple and pleasant to look at. Benches should be placed in areas of the greatest pedestrian use such as parks and plazas, near the library and community center and along sidewalks downtown under tree canopies. Benches used along downtown sidewalks should be placed parallel to the street facing the buildings nearest them approximately three feet from the back of the curb. One to two benches per block are recommended.
Trash receptacles are necessary downtown and serve the important function of keeping the downtown clean. Trash receptacles should be of a consistent design that is attractive but functional. Trash receptacles should be placed in areas of greatest pedestrian movement such as near the curb at street intersections, in parks and around the library and community center.

4.12.2 Design Criteria.
a.
Streetlights used along sidewalks or in parks shall be as distributed by the Georgia Power Co. (historic pole light). Specific pole placement and number of poles will be determined when building plans and location are submitted.
b.
Streetlights or pedestrian lights shall be spaced equidistant between all required street trees.
c.
Benches shall be of the style known as CDB 300 manufactured by Canterbury International (www.canterburyintl.com) in six-foot and eight-foot lengths.
d.
Trash receptacles shall conform to the Pennsylvania Avenue style, Model 101 or 103A, manufactured by Canterbury International (www.canterburyintl.com).
(c)
4.13 Sidewalks & Crosswalks.
(1)
4.13.1 Background.
Sidewalk materials and design provide the connecting link between the diverse buildings and personalities of each business in Downtown Smyrna. As the downtown gradually develops, the type of materials and design must remain consistent to tie the area together. Around the downtown park, library and community center the City of Smyrna has chosen to use brick pavers. Developments can be linked to the Community Center Complex by using the same paver bricks placed in concrete sidewalks as well as crosswalks as a way of unifying the whole downtown together.
Crosswalks should be strongly identified to indicate that downtown is primarily for pedestrians and not vehicles. Each intersection corner shall have a handicap access ramp that is made from concrete trimmed with brick pavers to make it easy for the blind to identify.
(2)
4.13.2 Design Criteria.
a.
Brick paver strips within concrete sidewalks shall be 16 inches wide and placed in the sidewalk parallel to the street and three feet behind the curb. Brick strips shall also run perpendicular to the street at 12-foot intervals.
b.
The type of pavers to be used is made by Holland-Stone in a mixture of colors as used in the downtown park.
c.
Raised crosswalks outlined with brick paver strips ten feet wide are required at major downtown street intersections.
d.
Public sidewalks in non-residential area shall be located along both sides of all streets and shall have minimum widths of ten feet. Sidewalks shall consist of two zones: a landscape zone and a sidewalk clear zone.
e.
Public sidewalks in residential areas shall be located along both sides of all streets and shall have minimum widths of five feet and a two foot landscaped buffer between the sidewalk and the street.
f.
Landscape zones shall be 5 feet in width and located immediately adjacent to the curb and shall be continuous. This zone may be used for street trees, streetlights, benches, planters, trash receptacles, bicycle parking racks and other street furniture, pedestrian lights, landscaping, or sod.
g.
Sidewalk clear zones shall be 10 feet in width and located immediately contiguous to the landscape zone and shall be continuous. Said zone shall be unobstructed for a minimum height of eight feet.
h.
Sidewalks are concrete six inches brick thick on a gravel base or all brick pavers.
i.
Handicapped access ramps are required at all downtown intersections.
(d)
4.14 Utility Lines.
(1)
4.14.1 Background.
The opportunity exists in downtown Smyrna to place all utility lines underground. Since the majority of downtown Smyrna is new development including new sidewalks, utility lines can be placed underground prior to sidewalks being set in place. Utility lines such as phone, electrical and cable should be planned through agreements with the utility companies. Conduit for utility lines should be installed underground before buildings are built to avoid cutting streets and sidewalks at a later date. When possible, electrical lines between streetlights and into buildings should be placed under the brick strips in sidewalks to avoid breaking the concrete at a later date.
(2)
4.14.2 Design Criteria.
a.
All utility lines shall be placed underground.
(e)
4.15 Public Signs.
(1)
4.15.1 Background.
The City of Smyrna will be responsible for erecting and maintaining public signs such as stop signs, street name signs and directional signs along public rights-of-way. The city has an opportunity to further define the downtown area with the style and materials used in the downtown signage. The city uses a typical aluminum painted sign throughout the city.
(f)
4.16 Maintenance.
(1)
4.16.1 Background.
The most critical part of any streetscape plan is the maintenance required to maintain the improvements. Either the property owner or the city needs to take responsibility for downtown maintenance. If allowed to deteriorate the money invested in trees, shrubs and street furniture will be lost. In an effort to correctly place responsibility for maintenance between the city and property owner the following division is recommended.
