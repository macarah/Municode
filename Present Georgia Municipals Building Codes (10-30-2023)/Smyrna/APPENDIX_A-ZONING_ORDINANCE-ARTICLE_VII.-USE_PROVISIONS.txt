Sec. 717. - [CDD], corridor design districts.
The intent of this section in establishing the (CDD) overlay districts is to promote orderly development of urban transportation corridors into mixed, but compatible uses, which implement the urban design concepts of the City of Smyrna Comprehensive Plan; complement the current development of the Central Business District; promote economic development of the city; promote high quality residential neighborhood development; enhance existing neighborhoods; minimize safety hazards to vehicles and pedestrians; and enhance the quality of life for Smyrna's citizens. These overlay districts shall include:
CDD-1
Atlanta Road
CDD-2
Spring Road
CDD-3
Windy Hill Road
CDD-4
South Cobb Drive
CDD-5
Concord Road
Section I: General Considerations
(717.1) Background. An accelerating economic revitalization is occurring on the major arterial corridors leading into the Central Business District of Smyrna and on South Cobb Drive. Much of this construction involves redevelopment or renovation of existing structures. In many sections of these corridors, the parcel geometry, building setbacks, vehicle access, signage and landscaping are obsolescent. These legacies represent the technologies and economic activities of past decades. Redevelopment offers the possibility of correcting features of the streetscape that are no longer appropriate, while contributing to the general economic development of the city.
Certain areas of Smyrna, particularly Atlanta Road, contain historical structures or buildings with distinct architectural styles which contribute to the quality of life of its citizens. The CDD overlay zones provide incentives for owners to preserve the integrity of historic buildings or architectural styles, while adapting them to current economic conditions. The design standards within these district regulations are very general, and do not have the specificity typically found in regulations for certified historic districts or landmarks. Nevertheless, owners of historic structures are urged to seek professional assistance when anticipating changes in external appearance, so that their original aesthetic integrity may be maintained.
The Corridor Design Districts (CDD) have been delineated by the City of Smyrna under its powers to regulate land use. They are composed of all parcels, tracts and structures located within their prescribed boundaries. Standards adopted for these districts include building setback lines; building heights; building spatial relationships; location and screening of parking; landscaping; signage location and specifications; location of building entrances; minimum and maximum lot sizes; conservation of significant natural features; pedestrian amenities; historical integrity; and general compatibility of architectural styles. The standards and regulations applying to the Corridor Design Districts are only mandatory for new construction, additions and site improvements. Projects involving only interior renovations; no change in gross floor areas; or no changes of signage are not subject to compliance with CDD regulations.
Several other codes and documents regulate construction in Smyrna. Federal and state adopted codes protecting safety of life and the access rights of disabled citizens shall have jurisdiction over any local governmental codes. Certain establishments such as nursing homes, day care centers, restaurants and hostelries have additional federal and state public health standards applied to them. Public health codes do not supersede zoning regulations, but rather they must be mutually compatible.
(717.2) Developmental history. Smyrna's urban fabric developed over a period of 150 years in response to a series of transportation improvements. Initially, crossroads hamlets sprang up along old Native American trading paths. In 1845 the Western and Atlantic Railroad closely paralleled the old trail leading between the Native American villages of Standing Peachtree and Etowah. Then, commercial and institutional buildings located near the intersection of Spring Street and Atlanta Road. The most important impetus for growth, however, arrived at the end of the 19th Century with the construction of the Atlanta and Marietta Electric Railway, an interurban transit line. During the next 40 years, numerous residential subdivisions and neighborhood shops were built next to transit shops. Small stores also began to spread down Spring Street, West Spring Street and Roswell Street.
During the 1920's and 1930's, the rough wagon roads were widened and paved. Atlanta Road became a section on the Dixie Highway, the main road between the Midwest and Florida. It began to experience increased auto-oriented commercial development. The other streets in Smyrna remained essentially residential in character. West of the railroad tracks, what is now known as Windy Hill Road, was named Cherokee Street and Jones Shaw Road. Roswell Street was probably the most important east-west connector. Concord Road quickly became a rural farm road as it departed the town limits.
The post-World War II era brought major physical changes to Smyrna. The early 1950's saw the construction of both major interurban highways and the first shopping centers. Both developments caused radical changes in Smyrna's urban fabric. The completion of four-lane U.S. 41 east of Smyrna shifted most intercity traffic away from Smyrna. Belmont Plaza shifted the destination of most east-west traffic to the north of the original town core. Jones Shaw Road, Cherokee Street and Windy Hill Road became very important arteries. During the late 1950's and early 1960's, these streets along with Concord Road and Spring Street experienced intensive residential development, typically brick ranchers on ¼—½ acre lots. During the early sixties, South Cobb Drive was constructed as an entirely new multi-laned thoroughfare. One of Atlanta's first shopping malls, Cobb Center opened at this time. By the late 60's, the sections of Windy Hill and Concord Roads near Atlanta Road were commercializing and Interstate 75 had been completed as far as Marietta. Smyrna's land development patterns were rapidly becoming incompatible with the exploding traffic volumes of the Atlanta metropolitan area.
During the last decade of the 20th Century, Smyrna has evolved from being in the economic backwaters of the Atlanta Region to being a nationally recognized model for urban revitalization. This remarkable renaissance has in turn, placed intensive redevelopment pressures on its arterial corridors. The 1970's and 1980's were typified by less dramatic road construction projects and general economic stagnation in Smyrna. A new route for Spring Road was cut diagonally to the southwest toward the downtown. Also, a railroad underpass and four-laned divided right-of-way for Windy Hill Road allowed traffic to flow more freely from the east into Central Smyrna. In the 80's, the city began development of its Community Center Complex and Cobb County widened, improved, and interconnected the Windy Hill Road-Cherokee Street-Jones Shaw Road corridor, eventually renaming the entire route Windy Hill Road. During this period, Cobb County and the Georgia DOT also completed a major upgrading of Atlanta Road with multiple lanes, sidewalks and landscaping. By the mid-1990's, Atlanta Road, Spring Road, Concord Road, Windy Hill Road and South Cobb Drive all were experiencing economic revitalization. The 1996 Comprehensive Plan for Smyrna recognized these accelerating changes, and recommended that the city institute special zoning and design standards to guide the redevelopment of these corridors so that obsolescent land use patterns and building geometry would not be reproduced in the new projects.
(717.3) District boundaries.
CDD-1, Atlanta Road.
The northern boundary shall be the southern boundary of the Downtown Design District (DDD-1) (just south of Concord Road).

(717.4) Application procedure. The Smyrna Department of Community Development has primary responsibility for review of proposed projects in the Corridor Design Districts. It is recommended that property owners or developers submit conceptual design drawings of the proposed project to the Smyrna Department of Community Development for informal staff review prior to their application for a ground disturbance or building permit. This shall help prevent expenditures of financial resources for changes of construction documents. Conceptual designs may take the form of dimensioned sketches, or may be more refined. However, the graphics should enable staff to determine if there are obvious conflicts with applicable codes and regulations. Upon advice of staff and/or the planning commission, the city council may waive certain requirements of these district regulations when the geometry of a specific land parcel makes compliance impossible or creates an undue hardship.
Standard applications for zoning changes, ground disturbance permits, sign permits, and building permits shall be utilized for proposed projects in the Corridor Design Districts. All applications within the boundaries of these districts shall clearly state that the project is located within the (appropriate name) Corridor Design District. Procedures mandated in the City of Smyrna Zoning Ordinance, City of Smyrna Subdivision Ordinance, and the Standard Building Code (SBCC) shall be followed.
All projects within the Corridor Design Districts involving the demolition of, or exterior changes to, a building constructed before 1945 shall be first referred for review by the Smyrna Urban Design Commission. These regulations do not prohibit the demolition or renovation of existing structures. New or renovated structures may be more compatible with nearby properties. However, the recommendations of the UDC will be forwarded to the City of Smyrna's Planning and Zoning Commission to ensure implementation of the City of Smyrna's Comprehensive Plan.
If changes are requested by the city council, a revised site plan or set of construction drawings (whichever is applicable) must be signed and dated by the applicant, then submitted and approved by staff prior to issuance of any permits. Approval of a proposed project will be verified by a ground disturbance or building permit. Any significant variation which is not in compliance with the city's codes and ordinances will give sufficient grounds for the department of community development to issue a stop work order on the project, and possibly make the property owner, developer, and/or general contractor subject to civil penalties or judicial action.
(717.5) Determination of applicable code requirements. Whenever a conflict exists between the requirements of this section, and any other section of the Code or Ordinances of the City of Smyrna, or the State of Georgia, or the Federal Government, the more stringent of the two or more regulatory criteria applies, as determined by the staff of the City of Smyrna's Department of Community Development.
(717.6) Appeals procedure. If the city council denies an application, the applicant may follow an appeals procedure. However, any request for review by the city council which relates to these regulations shall be deferred until the next monthly meeting of the urban design commission, so that it may examine the original application and appeal, and make a recommendation to the city council. The appeal shall be received no less than 15 days before the DDRC's regular meeting date in order to be acted on.

Sec. 719. - Redevelopment overlay district [ROD].
The regulations for the ROD redevelopment overlay district are as follows:
(719.1) Purpose and intent. The ROD is established to provide locations for mixed use development and redevelopment of commercial, office and residential uses which are pedestrian oriented and developed at a community or regional activity center scale and intensity. The district may be overlaid upon the RM-12, RHR, CBD and GC and zoning districts and either community activity center, high density residential or mixed-use land use categories. The mayor and council has determined that any redevelopment project approved within a ROD shall not establish any type of precedent for land use recommendations or future rezoning proposals outside of the boundaries of the ROD project. Those properties outside of the boundaries of a ROD project must provide uses compatible with other surrounding properties as defined and shown on the most recently adopted version of the City of Smyrna Comprehensive Plan.
(719.2) Permitted uses. Permitted uses are as follows:
(1)
Athletic and health clubs.
(2)
Automotive parking lots or garages.

(719.3) Lot size and setback requirements.
(1)
Design of entire project must be consistent with the city's urban design standards as may be amended from time to time.
(2)
Minimum project area: Five acres. Smaller tracts may be considered appropriate if within 200 feet of an existing or proposed redevelopment project.
(719.4) Landscape buffer and screening requirements. Unless otherwise noted within this district's requirements, any property within an ROD which abuts residentially zoned property shall have a minimum 25-foot landscaped screening buffer adjacent to all residentially zoned property. Buffers may be included within required setbacks; however, in such case that the required buffer is greater than the required setback, the required buffer shall be adhered to. Additionally, necessary private utilities and access drives may be allowed through, over or across a landscaped buffer. The design of the buffer shall comply with Section 503 of the city's Zoning Code.
(719.5) Building and structure requirements. Maximum building height is 55 feet, unless approved by the mayor and council in consultation with the fire chief to insure adequacy of fire protection facilities and services.
(719.6) Parking requirements. See article IX for paved parking specifications. Parking for non-residential or multifamily uses may be granted a 20 percent reduction in required parking when parking is shared between adjacent uses within the project. An additional ten percent reduction may be administratively approved by the director of community development, or his/her designee. Final parking design plans shall be subject to review and approval of the director of community development, or his/her designee.
(719.7) Lighting requirements. Lighting levels shall not exceed .25 footcandles when measured at adjacent residentially zoned properties. There shall be no limitation on lighting levels when adjacent to non-residential properties.
(719.8) Procedures for ROD overlay utilization. As the ROD is overlaid upon an existing zoning district, the project will be reviewed and approved or denied in a streamlined manner. The application of the ROD is not considered a rezoning. Staff will accept applications, then review and recommend approval or denial. A schedule of application submittal deadlines, concept plan review meetings, and projected council meeting dates will be made available to the public. As the underlying zoning will not change, staff recommendations will be taken to the mayor and council on the next available agenda. ROD proposals are required to be posted for a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 45 days prior to the council meeting. A public hearing will be held at the time the council reviews and decides each proposal. If the project is denied by the council, no prejudice period will apply. Further, upon gaining approval of an ROD overlay plan, the applicant maintains the option to develop the property according to the requirements of the underlying zoning. However, ROD approval will be voided if no application for permit approval is received by the city within the first six months after final ROD approval. Additionally, the ROD approval will be voided upon expiration of any approved building permits. The following review procedure will apply:
(1)
Application. Applications for ROD overlay district utilization with an existing zoning will be accepted in the community development department. The application fee is $500.00.
(2)
Concept plan review. There will be a regularly scheduled ROD review meeting of the city staff scheduled twice monthly. Conceptual approval must be obtained prior to placing the property on a council agenda. The purpose of the conceptual plan review is:
a.
Familiarize sponsors of projects with city regulations and the concerns of city departments prior to expenditure for preparation of final development plans.
b.
Familiarize city representatives with proposed project and provide an opportunity for an exchange of views and ideas on project characteristics that are of concern to the goals of the ROD ordinance.
(3)
Participants. The city staff to be present include at least one representative from the following departments:

Also for such developments on the city's sanitary sewer system, at a fee of $1,000.00, the city will conduct the capacity analysis to study the impacts of the new development or redevelopment to the sanitary sewer system, and if the sanitary sewer system has adequate capacity to support the wastewater from the new development or redevelopment.
k.
If the property is or will be on a septic tank, contact the Cobb County Health Department. Approval must be obtained prior to the filing of the application for rezoning.
l.
A development that exceeds 100,000 net square feet or 75 dwelling units will be required to submit a traffic, water, sewer, and school impact statement with the rezoning application. A development that is less than 100,000 net square feet or 75 dwelling units may be required to submit one or all of the above statements upon request. A final decision, by the mayor and city council, may not be made until these statements are received with the ROD application.
