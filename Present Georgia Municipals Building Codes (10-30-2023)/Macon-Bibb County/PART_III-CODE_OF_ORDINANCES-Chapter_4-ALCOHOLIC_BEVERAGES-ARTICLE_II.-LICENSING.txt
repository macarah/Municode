(a)
The provisions of this Code on general business licensing shall apply in addition to the provisions of this Section.

(1)
All applications shall be filed in the name of an individual, not an entity. Only one individual shall be the applicant on any application for a license to be issued under this Chapter. Any individual applying for a license pursuant to this Chapter shall identify on such application the name, entity type, and location of any business entity that will be operating pursuant to such license, if granted. No more than one business entity may operate pursuant to any individual license issued under this Chapter, and no business entity may operate in more than one business location pursuant to any individual license issued under this Chapter. An application may be completed by someone other than the applicant, but must be signed and sworn to by the applicant in the presence of a notary public.

The applicant for any application shall be either the person serving as agent on the application, as provided in Section 4-24 of this Chapter, or one of the following:
(A)
If the entity that will be operating pursuant to such license, if granted, is a sole proprietorship, then the sole proprietor;
(B)
If the entity that will be operating pursuant to such license, if granted, is a general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited partnership, then a general partner;
(C)
If the entity that will be operating pursuant to such license, if granted, is a limited liability company, then a managing member, if any, or a member with a twenty-five percent or greater ownership interest, if any, or one member from among those members with the greatest ownership interest if no individual member holds a twenty-five percent or greater ownership interest in the entity;

By way of example, if Person A applies for a license on behalf of Z, LLC, and Person B owns fifty percent of X, Inc.; and X, Inc. holds a seventy-five percent general partnership interest in Y, L.P., and Y, L.P. holds a thirty percent managing membership interest in Z, LLC, then Person B would be considered, for purposes of this Section, to be a managing member of Z, LLC, with an interest equal to the product of fifty percent, times seventy-five percent, times thirty percent, or eleven and one-quarter percent total.

Sec. 4-58. - Issuance of temporary license while application pending.
At the time of application, or any time prior to the final adjudication of any application submitted under this Chapter, any applicant may obtain a temporary license for the manufacture or sale of alcoholic beverages pursuant to the terms of this Section.
(a)
Any person or entity completing the following may be issued a temporary alcohol license:
(1)
The person or entity must have submitted a complete application for one or more annual alcohol licenses, pursuant to this Chapter, and paid all fees therefor;
(2)
The applicant or its agent must successfully complete a fingerprint background check, SAVE Verification, and meet all criminal history requirements imposed by this Chapter;
(3)
The location to be licensed must be approved by the Macon-Bibb County Engineer for compliance with all distance requirements imposed in this Chapter; and the Macon-Bibb County Planning and Zoning Commission for zoning and usage approval;
(4)
The applicant must submit a written request for a temporary alcohol license, and pay an additional, non-refundable fee therefor; and
(5)
No temporary license will issue to any applicant if the applicant, the agent, or any business operating at the location to be licensed has been the subject of any Adverse Action against any license previously issued under this Chapter, within the past two years.
(b)
Upon completing all requirements set out in paragraph (a) of this Section, the applicant shall be entitled to immediately receive a temporary alcohol license, which license shall allow the applicant to conduct all business activities which the applicant would be authorized to conduct in the event that the pending application is granted in full, and without conditions. The department issuing the temporary license shall notify the Sheriffs Office of the fact of issuance at the time of issuance.
(c)
All temporary licenses issued pursuant to this Section shall be clearly and conspicuously marked as such.
(d)
All temporary licenses issued under this Section shall expire by operation of law on the day following the date on which the corresponding application for annual licensure is finally adjudicated. For purposes of this code Section, an application is "finally adjudicated" on the day that the annual license is actually issued, or, if the corresponding application for annual licensure is denied in part or in full, upon the expiration of any period allowed by law to obtain review by a superior judiciary. Each temporary licensee is under a duty to know at all times whether its license application has been finally adjudicated, and it shall be considered a violation of this Section for any temporary licensee to operate under an expired temporary license. In the event that a temporary license is not finally adjudicated until after the time that the license applied for, if issued, would have expired, then the license application shall instead be construed as an application for a license effective during the calendar year in which the application is finally adjudicated.
(e)
The issuance of a temporary license shall have no effect on the consideration of a corresponding annual license application, and shall not be construed to create any expectation that an annual license will be issued.
(f)
All licensees operating pursuant to a temporary license are subject to all rules and regulations set out in this Code in the same manner and to the same extent as licensees operating pursuant to an annual license. Any events occurring prior to the final issuance of an annual alcohol license may be considered as evidence in support of taking Adverse Action on the licensee's pending annual license application, including, but not limited to, any adverse change in conditions at or near the licensed premises; or any citation for violations of any ordinance or statute relating to the sales or consumption of alcohol on a premises, or the operations of a licensed premises.
(g)
Temporary licensees shall have no vested interest in their temporary licenses. For any licensee operating pursuant to a temporary license issued under this Section, if such licensee, or such licensee's agent or employee, is cited or charged with violating any statute or ordinance relating to the manufacture, sales, service, or consumption of alcoholic beverages, then all temporary licenses issued pursuant to this Section shall be immediately and summarily revoked at the time of citation or charging, and such licensee shall immediately thereafter suspend all business activities which were previously being conducted pursuant to such temporary license.
(h)
If, at any point in the process of evaluating the annual license application that corresponds with a temporary license issued pursuant to this subsection, it becomes apparent that the applicant likely does not meet one or more of the material requirements for annual licensure, then the temporary license shall be subject to immediate and summary revocation, without advanced notice or additional process.

A completed SAVE verification form in compliance with O.C.G.A. § 50-36-1; and
(2)

(b)

(d)
Fees paid for a business continuation alcohol license shall be non-refundable, and no credit shall be given against any other license fees or taxes based on any fees spent on any business continuation alcohol license.
(e)
Nothing in this Section shall be construed as requiring the County to issue any other license under this Chapter to any person or persons.
