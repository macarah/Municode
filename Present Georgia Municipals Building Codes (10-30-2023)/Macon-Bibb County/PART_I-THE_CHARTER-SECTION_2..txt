SECTION 2.
(a)
The restructured government shall have and be vested with, to the same extent as if repeated in this charter, all rights, powers, duties, privileges, and authority that the City of Macon or Bibb County, or both collectively, have under the Constitution and general and special laws of Georgia at the time of the adoption of this charter, except as expressly modified in this charter.
(b)
In addition to the foregoing, the restructured government shall have all rights, powers, duties, privileges, and authority conferred or enlarged by this charter, and such other rights, powers, duties, privileges, and authority as may be necessary and proper for carrying the same into execution, and also all rights, powers, duties, privileges, and authority, whether express or implied, that may now be vested in or hereafter granted to counties or municipal corporations, or both, by the Constitution and laws of this state, including the powers vested in the restructured government by this charter.
(c)
The restructured government, in addition to the rights, duties, powers, privileges, and authority expressly conferred upon it by this charter, shall have the right, duty, power, privilege, and authority to exercise and enjoy all other powers, duties, functions, rights, privileges, and immunities necessary and proper to promote or protect the safety, health, peace, security, and general welfare of said government and its inhabitants and to exercise all implied powers necessary to carry into execution all powers granted in this charter as fully and completely as if such powers were fully enumerated in this charter and to do and perform all of the acts pertaining to its local affairs, property, and government that are necessary or proper in the legitimate exercise of its corporate powers and governmental duties and functions.
(d)
No enumeration of any right, power, privilege, or authority hereinafter made shall be construed as limiting or abolishing any right, power, privilege, or authority set forth in this charter.
(e)
No repeal of any law under which the restructured government derives any right, power, privilege, or authority, except by amendment of this charter as provided in this charter, shall be construed as limiting or abolishing any such right, power, privilege, or authority set forth in this charter.
(f)
The general laws of the State of Georgia of a criminal nature shall be applicable to and within the limits of the restructured government. General laws of local application through classification by population, not in conflict with this charter:
(1)
Which on the effective date of this charter apply to the City of Macon or Bibb County shall be applicable to the restructured government; and
(2)
Which apply to the restructured government as either a city or a county at the time of their enactment or thereafter shall be effective, but those which did not apply to the City of Macon or Bibb County or the restructured government at the time of their enactment shall not become applicable to the restructured government except through the adoption of a resolution to that effect by the commission.
(g)
Local Acts of the State of Georgia which apply specifically to Bibb County or the City of Macon, or both collectively, shall be applicable to the restructured government.

The Constitution of the State of Georgia;
(2)
The general laws of uniform application now in force or hereafter enacted by the General Assembly, as distinguished from general laws of local application through classification by population, applicable to municipal corporations or counties, or both;
(3)
The general laws of local application through classification by population as and to the extent provided in subsection (a) of this section;
