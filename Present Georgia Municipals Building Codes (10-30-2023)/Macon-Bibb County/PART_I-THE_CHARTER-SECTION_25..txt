SECTION 25.
(a)
All employees and former employees of Bibb County and the City of Macon and of every agency, instrumentality, commission, or authority thereof shall retain those pension rights, if any, which had accrued to them prior to the effective date of this charter under any pension plan adopted by law or by ordinance or resolution by the board of commissioners of Bibb County or the mayor and commission of the City of Macon. The commission shall assume on the effective date of this charter all obligations arising under all such pension plans, but the assumption of such obligations by the commission shall not create any obligation on the part of the commission or create any right which did not exist prior to the effective date of this charter.
(b)
The commission is authorized and empowered to establish and maintain a new pension system or pension systems affecting new employees and such other employees as desire to be covered thereby and to revise, combine, and consolidate any pension system in effect on the effective date of this charter; provided, however, that in no event shall any revision, combination, or unification of any existing pension system in effect when this charter is adopted result in the curtailment or diminishment of any right accrued under any existing pension system to any person heretofore employed by the City of Macon, Bibb County, or of any agency of such former governments.
