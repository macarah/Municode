1/1/1996 — 6/30/2009 — 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table for Males

Effective for distributions with annuity starting dates on or after January 1, 2003, and notwithstanding any other Plan provisions to the contrary, the applicable mortality table used for purposes of adjusting any benefit limitation under Code Section 415(b)(2)(B) (relating to the adjustment to the benefit limitation amount for forms of benefit other than a straight life annuity), Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) (relating to the adjustment to the benefit limitation where benefits begin before age 62), or Code Section 415(b)(2)(D) (relating to the adjustment to the benefit limitation where benefits begin after age 65), as set forth in Article 12 of the Plan, is the table prescribed in Rev. Rul. 2001-62. For any distribution with an annuity starting date on or after the effective date of this Section and before the adoption date of this Section, if application of the amendment as of the annuity starting date would have caused a reduction in the amount of any distribution, such reduction is not reflected in any payment made before the adoption date of this Section. However, the amount of any such reduction that is required under Code Section 415(b)(2)(B) (relating to the adjustment to the benefit limitation amount for forms of benefit other than a straight life annuity), must be reflected actuarially over any remaining payments to the Participant.

Beneficiary means for employees hired on and after January 1, 2004, the Participant's Spouse, unless such Spouse has waived all rights under the Plan in a written instrument.

A Participant may designate any individual, trust or other entity as his Beneficiary for purposes of receiving a refund of his Participant Contributions under the circumstances described in Article 4. Such a Beneficiary designation shall be made separately from the designation of a Beneficiary to receive a death benefit under Article 9. If the Participant does not designate a Beneficiary for this purpose, or the Beneficiary so designated does not survive the Participant, the Participant's Beneficiary for purposes of receiving any refund of Participant Contributions shall be his Spouse, if the Participant is survived by a Spouse, or the Participant's estate if he is not survived by a Spouse.

Death Benefit. Effective January 16, 1990; the Participant's Beneficiary may elect to receive one of the following:
(i)
a monthly payment from the Plan equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Normal Retirement Pension that the Participant would have received at his Normal Retirement Date had he lived to that date, commencing as of the Participant's Normal Retirement Date (if he had lived), or
(ii)
a monthly payment from the Plan equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Normal Retirement Pension that the Participant would have received at his Normal Retirement Date had he lived to that date, commencing as of the first day of the month following his death, but effective November 5, 1999, reduced by two percent (2%) per year for each year the benefit commences prior to the Participant's Normal Retirement Date (if he had lived) (reduced by one half of one percent (1/2%) effective prior to November 5, 1999).
(c)
Commencement of Benefit. The benefit described in (b)(i) and (b)(ii) above shall continue for the lifetime of the Beneficiary or if the Beneficiary is the Participant's Spouse until the month in which the Spouse remarries, if earlier.
(d)
Non-Spouse Beneficiary. Effective for Eligible Employees hired on and after January 1, 2004, the Participant's Beneficiary shall be the Participant's Spouse, unless such Spouse has explicitly waived all rights under the Plan in a written instrument. If the Spouse effectively waives benefits under the Plan, or the Participant has no Spouse on his date of death, the Participant's children (by birth or adoption) under the age of eighteen will receive any benefits due in equal shares until the child reaches the age of eighteen (18) (age twenty-two (22) if the child is student enrolled full time in an accredited post secondary institution of higher learning). If the Participant is not married and has no children under the age of eighteen (18) (age twenty-two (22) if the child is student enrolled full time in an accredited post secondary institution of higher learning) no death benefit shall be paid.
For purposes of (ii) above, a child is a full-time student if he is enrolled as a full-time student at an educational institution during any five months of a calendar year. This enrollment status shall be redetermined each calendar year.
Only enrollment in a school that has a regular teaching staff and course of study and is a junior or senior high school, college, university, technical or mechanical school shall satisfy the requirements above. Enrollment in a night school that satisfies the requirement in the preceding sentence and in which the child is enrolled for the number of hours or classes equivalent to full-time attendance at a similar day school also shall satisfy this requirement. On-the-job training courses, correspondence schools or other home education do not satisfy this requirement.
The Pension Trustee Board shall determine whether a particular child is a full-time student, and its decision thereon shall be final.

9.02 - Death After Normal Retirement Date but before Annuity Starting Date
If a Participant dies after his Normal Retirement Date but before he actually retires from employment with the Employer, the Participant shall be deemed to have retired immediately before his death and elected a 100 % joint and survivor annuity. Effective for Eligible Employees hired on and after January 1, 2004, the Participant's Beneficiary shall be the Participant's Spouse, unless such Spouse has explicitly waived all rights under the Plan in a written instrument. If the Spouse effectively waives benefits under the Plan, or the Participant has no Spouse on his date of death, the Participant's children (by birth or adoption) under the age of eighteen will receive any benefits due in equal shares until the child reaches the age of eighteen (18) (age twenty-two (22) if the child is student enrolled full time in an accredited post secondary institution of higher

9.03 - Death After Annuity Starting Date.
If a Participant dies after his Annuity Starting Date, whether the Participant's Spouse or any other person receives a survivor's benefit shall be determined according to the form of benefit in which the Participant's benefit was being paid or which the Participant had elected. For example, if the Participant elected a single life annuity form of benefit, no survivor's benefit shall be paid.
( Ord. No. O-15-0062, § 1, 12-15-2015 )
ARTICLE 10 - OPTIONAL FORMS OF PAYMENT

10.01 - Optional Form of Payment.
In lieu of receiving a monthly payment for life, the Participant may elect any of the following options. Any amount received by the Participant under an option selected below shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Regular Monthly Benefit described in Section 5.02 (i.e. life annuity with no survivor benefits).
(a)
Life Annuity with Guaranteed Payments. This is a reduced monthly amount payable to the Participant for life with a certain number of monthly payments guaranteed. The Participant may elect a guaranteed payment of either 60 or 120 months.
(b)
Joint and Survivor Annuity Options. This is a reduced monthly payment made to the Participant for his life and, upon the Participant's death, a percentage of the Participant's benefit shall be paid to the Participant's designated Beneficiary. The Participant shall elect the percentage that will be payable to the Participant's designated Beneficiary when electing this form of benefit. Payments shall cease as of the later of the death of the Participant or the death of the Participant's designated Beneficiary.
(c)
Death of Beneficiary Before Annuity Starting Date. If a Participant elects the Joint and Survivor Annuity but the designated Beneficiary dies before the Annuity Starting Date, the Participant may revoke his election. His benefit shall be paid as a Regular Monthly Benefit under Section 5.02 unless the Participant elects a new Beneficiary. If the designated Beneficiary dies after the Participant's Annuity Starting Date but before the Participant starts receiving his monthly payments, the Participant shall receive the reduced monthly benefits in accordance with his election of this option.
(d)
Electing the Optional Form of Payment. At least thirty (30) days, but no more than ninety (90) days, before the Participant's Annuity Starting Date, a Participant who wishes to elect the optional form of payment shall submit a written election in the form prescribed by the Plan Administrator. If a Participant does not properly elect an optional form of benefit, his benefit shall be paid as a Regular Monthly Benefit for life as described in Section 5.02.
A Participant may revoke an option prior to his Annuity Starting Date by filing a revocation, or a new election, with the Plan Administrator prior to his Annuity Starting Date. A Participant may not revoke or change an election after his benefits begin.
(e)
MDIB Rules. Any optional form of benefit and any designated Beneficiary named by the Participant must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of proposed Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-2, or its successor. This rule ensures that the retirement benefits payable under the Plan are more than incidental.
( Ord. No. O-15-0062, § 1, 12-15-2015 )
10.02 - Commencement of Benefits.
(a)
For any participant who has not attained age 70½ before January 1, 2020, regardless of whether the Participant has an hour of service on or after January 1, 2020, the following rule shall apply:

If, as of the date that this amended and restated Plan is adopted, a Participant in active employment with the Employer is receiving distributions on account of his attaining age 70½, the Participant shall continue to receive Plan distributions.
(b)
Normal Retirement Date. Payment of a Participant's retirement benefit shall begin no later than his Normal Retirement Date or, if he continues in employment past his Normal Retirement Age, his actual or late retirement date.

10.03 - Continued Employment After Normal Retirement Age.
A Participant who continues in the employ of an Employer after his Normal Retirement Age may not elect to begin receiving his Accrued Benefit until after he has Terminated Employment with the Employer.
( Ord. No. O-15-0062, § 1, 12-15-2015 )
10.04 - Reemployment of a Retired Participant.
(a)
Election to continue Payments. Except as provided in subsection (b) below, any Participant who (i) retired or otherwise Terminated Employment, (ii) is receiving a Normal or Early Retirement Pension or payments under the Early Retirement Incentive described in section 6.03 of the Plan, and (iii) is thereafter rehired, elected or appointed to fill an unexpired term as an Eligible Employee with the Employer, shall make the following election upon rehire, election or appointment:

Continue to be considered retired under the provisions of the Plan and continue to receive his Normal or Early Retirement Pension hereunder during the period of any such reemployment but accrue no more benefits under the Plan, or
(2)

Rehire Within Two Months. Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, any Participant who is rehired within two (2) months of his or her Termination of Employment and prior to Normal Retirement Age, shall cease payment of any Early Retirement Pension being paid to him hereunder during his period of reemployment, regardless of whether such Participant is eligible to accrue benefits under the Plan during his reemployment.
Any increases in benefits after rehire shall be offset by the Actuarial Equivalent of the payments already received by the Participant. Participants whose payments are suspended may elect a different form of benefit payment upon subsequent retirement.
( Ord. No. O-15-0062, § 1, 12-15-2015 )
10.05 - Rollovers.
(a)
General Rule. This provision shall be effective January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a Distributee's election under this section, a Distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have any portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee in a direct rollover.
(b)
Definitions.
(1)
Eligible Rollover Distribution. An Eligible Rollover Distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the Distributee, except that an Eligible Rollover Distribution does not include (i) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the Distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the Distributee and the Distributee's designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; (ii) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9). A Distributee may not elect a direct rollover with respect to an Eligible Rollover Distribution during the Plan Year that is less than $200. If the Distributee elects to have only a portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution paid to an Eligible Retirement Plan, that portion must be equal to at least $500.
Effective for distributions after December 31, 2001, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an Eligible Rollover Distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions, which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Code Section 408(a) or (b) or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Code Section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion that is not. Effective for distributions made on and after January 1, 2007, after-tax amounts may also be transferred to an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b) that agrees to the separate accounting rules described above.
Effective January 1, 2010, Eligible Rollover Distribution includes a distribution to a non-spouse Beneficiary
(2)
Eligible Retirement Plan. An Eligible Retirement Plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the Distributee's Eligible Rollover Distribution. If the distribution is made after December 31, 2001, Eligible Retirement Plan also includes an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), and an eligible deferred compensation plan under Code Section 457(b) that is maintained by a state, political subdivision or agency or instrumentality of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred to such plan from this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Eligible Rollover Distribution to the Participant's Spouse or the Participant's non-spouse Beneficiary who is his designated Beneficiary within the meaning on Code Section 401(a)(9)(E), an Eligible Retirement Plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. Effective as of January 1, 2008, "Eligible Retirement Plan" shall include a Roth IRA described in Code Section 408A.
(3)
Distributee. A Distributee includes a Participant, former Participant spouse, former spouse or effective as of January 1, 2010, a non-spouse beneficiary.
(4)
Direct Rollover. A Direct Rollover is a payment by the Plan to the Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee.
( Ord. No. O-15-0062, § 1, 12-15-2015 )
10.06 - Conformance to Section 401(a)(9).
(a)
Effective Date. The rules set forth in this amended and restated Section 10.06 shall apply for purposes of determining the Required Minimum Distribution to Participants and Designated Beneficiaries (as defined below) for calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 2006 even if, in the case of a Beneficiary, the Participant died before 2006. A Participant or Beneficiary who would have been required to receive required minimum distributions for 2009 but for the enactment of Code Section 401(a)(9)(H) shall not receive those distributions for 2009 unless the Participant or Beneficiary chooses to receive such distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary any required minimum distribution made in 2009 shall be treated as Eligible Rollover Distribution.
(b)
Commencement of Distribution. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, distribution to a Participant shall commence not later than the Required Beginning Date. The Required Beginning Date shall be April 1 of the calendar year following the later of (i) the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 72 (age 70½ in the case of a Participant who turned age 70½ before January 1,2020) or (ii) the calendar year in which occurs the Participant's Retirement Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Required Beginning Date for any Participant who has attained or will attain age 70½ on or before December 31, 1998, and has an Accrued Benefit under the Plan (including any Prior Plan) as of December 31, 1996, shall be April 1 following the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70½, regardless of whether the Participant is then employed by the Employer. Nothing in this Section 10.06 shall be deemed to extend any death benefit or permit any Beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this Plan. This Section 10.06 shall, instead, be deemed to limit and modify any provision of this Plan to the extent that such limitation or modification is necessary to ensure that the Plan complies with this Section 10.06, Code Section 401(a)(9) and the Regulations thereunder.
This restated Section 10.06(b) shall apply regardless of whether a Participant has an hour of service on or after January 1, 2020.
(c)
Period of Distribution. The entire interest of each Participant in this Plan will be distributed, beginning not later than the Required Beginning Date described in paragraph (b) above, over the life of such Participant or over the lives of such Participant and his Designated Beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such Participant or the life expectancy of such Participant and his Designated Beneficiary.
(d)
Death of Participant After Distribution has Begun. If distribution of a Participant's interest has begun in accordance with paragraph (b) above (i.e., distributions on or after the Required Beginning Date), and if the Participant dies before his entire interest has been distributed to him, then the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under paragraph (b) as of the date of the Participant's death.
(e)
Death of Participant Before Distribution has Begun. If a Participant dies before distribution of the Participant's interest has begun in accordance with paragraph (b) above (i.e., no distributions have been made on or after the Required Beginning Date), the entire interest of the Participant must be paid over whichever of the following periods is applicable:
(i)
If one or more Designated Beneficiaries is not the Participant's Spouse, the distribution period shall be the Designated Beneficiary's remaining life expectancy.
(ii)
If the sole Designated Beneficiary is the Participant's Spouse, the distribution period shall be the Spouse's remaining life expectancy.
(iii)
If there is no Designated Beneficiary, the entire Account shall be distributed by the end of the calendar year that includes the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death.
Distributions under this Section 10.06(e) above shall commence as follows:
(i)
Distributions under 10.06(e)(i) (i.e., distribution to a non-Spouse Designated Beneficiary) shall begin on or before the end of the calendar year that begins immediately after the calendar year in which the Participant died.
(ii)
Distributions under Section 10.06(e)(ii) (i.e., distribution to a Spousal Designated Beneficiary) shall begin on or before the later of the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died and the end of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70 1/2.
(f)
Form of Distribution. For a Participant who is employed by an Employer after his Required Beginning Date, any distribution payable under this Section 10.06 may be paid in any optional form of benefit that is available under the Plan, provided that all consent requirements under the Plan are satisfied. Any form of distribution payable under this Plan, however, must:
(i)
be in the form of a periodic annuity for the Participant's life, or for the joint life expectancy of the Participant and Designated Beneficiary or over a period certain that does not exceed the maximum length of the period certain determined under the Regulations;
(ii)
the interval between payments must be uniform over the entire distribution period and must not exceed one year;
(iii)
if payments have commenced over a period certain, the period certain may not be changed;
(iv)
distributions in the form of a life annuity must satisfy the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6, A-2, or any successor regulation thereto; and
(v)
all payments, either in the form of a life annuity or over a period certain must either be nonincreasing or increase only in accordance with the rules set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6, A-1.
For purposes of this Section 10.06, references to a life annuity shall include an annuity for the joint life expectancy of the Participant and the Designated Beneficiary.
(g)
Lump Sum Distributions. In the case of a lump sum distribution from this Plan that is distributed in or after the calendar year in which the Participant attains or would have attained age 72 (age 70½, in the case of a Participant who attains or would have attained age 70½ before January 1, 2020), the amount of the lump sum that equals the Participant's or Designated Beneficiary's Required Minimum Distribution and thus is not an Eligible Rollover Distribution within the meaning of Section 10.06 of the Plan shall be determined using either of the methods set forth in the Regulations. The Plan Administrator shall have the sole discretion to elect the calculation method but shall apply the same method to all lump sum distributions made in the same calendar year.
This restated Section 10.06(g) shall apply regardless of whether a Participant has an hour of service on or after January 1, 2020.
(h)
Incidental Death Benefit Requirement. Any optional form of benefit elected by the Participant or Designated Beneficiary must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G). This rule insures that the retirement benefits payable under the Plan are more than incidental.
(i)
Actuarial Increase After Age 70 1/2.
(1)
Except with respect to a Participant who is a 5% owner (as defined in Code Section 401(a)(9) and Treasury Regulations thereunder), a participant's Accrued Benefit shall be actuarially increased to take into account the period after age 70-1/2 in which the employee does not receive any benefits under the plan. The actuarial increase shall commence on April 1 following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70-1/2, and end on the date on which benefits commence after retirement in an amount sufficient to satisfy Code Section 401(a)(9).
The Accrued Benefit payable to such a Participant as of the end of the period for which the actuarial increase is required shall not be less than:
(i)
the Actuarial Equivalent of the employee's Accrued Benefit as of April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant attained age 70 1/2, plus
(ii)
the Actuarial Equivalent of any additional benefits accrued after the date described in (i) above, less
(iii)
the Actuarial Equivalent of any distributions made with respect to the Participant's Accrued Benefit after such date.
(2)
The actuarial increase described above may reduce the benefit accrual otherwise required under Code Section 411(b)(1)(H)(i).
(3)
The actuarial adjustment described above shall be made even during a period for which benefits are suspended pursuant to Article 10.
(j)
Plan Administrator's Discretion. The Plan Administrator shall have the sole authority and full discretion to apply the provisions of this Section 10.06 to any benefit option elected by the Participant. The Plan Administrator may, for example, modify a Participant's selection of an optional form of benefit to satisfy the incidental death benefit requirement by requiring, at its discretion, that the Participant select another form of benefit or another contingent annuitant, or by modifying the form of benefit so that it complies with the applicable rules.
(k)
Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply to this Section 10.06, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary.
(i)
Designated Beneficiary. The term "Designated Beneficiary" shall be determined in accordance with the definition of "Beneficiary" in the Regulations, notwithstanding that this definition may be different from that set forth elsewhere in this Plan, provided that any individual who is a Designated Beneficiary must also be a Beneficiary (but not necessarily all of the Beneficiaries) as defined in this Plan. Each Beneficiary, as defined in the Plan, however, need not be a Designated Beneficiary in the event, for example, that a Beneficiary disclaims his interest under this Plan.
(ii)
Spouse. "Spouse" shall mean "Spouse" as defined in the Regulations. Nothing in this Section 10.06 shall be deemed, however, to extend any death benefit or permit any Beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this Plan.
(iii)
Regulations. "Regulations" shall refer to the Treasury Regulations (including temporary Regulations) promulgated under Code Section 401(a)(9), as set forth in Treasury Regulations 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-6T, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS in the form of revenue rulings, notices and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or any successor thereto.

Provisions applicable to Plan Years beginning January 1, 1989 until December 31, 1993.
Distribution of a Participant's entire interest will commence not later than the April 1 following the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70-1/2 (the Participant's "required commencement date"); provided, however, that the required commencement date of a Participant who attained age 70-1/2 prior to January 1, 1988 shall be April 1 of the calendar year next following the later of the calendar year in which he attained age 70-1/2 or the calendar year in which he retires, and the required commencement date of a Participant who attained age 70-1/2 in calendar year 1988 shall be April 1, 1990. In the event a Participant dies before benefits commence, his interest may be paid to the Participant's surviving spouse over a period certain not to exceed the spouse's life expectancy. If a Participant dies before benefits commence and his surviving spouse is not the beneficiary, the entire remaining interest must be distributed to the Participant's beneficiary within five years. However, if distributions have commenced to the Participant before the Participant's death, distributions to the Participant's beneficiary may continue according to the option selected by the Participant.
(m)
Provisions applicable to Plan Years beginning January 1, 1994 until December 31, 2001.
(i)
Age 70-1/2 Rule. Distribution of a Participant's benefits will commence not later than the April 1 following the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70-1/2 (the Participant's "required commencement date"). In the event a Participant dies before benefits commence, his interest may be paid to the Participant's surviving spouse over a period certain not to exceed the spouse's life expectancy and must commence by the later of (A) the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the Participant dies or (b) the end of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70-1/2. If a Participant dies before benefits commence and his surviving spouse is not the beneficiary, the entire remaining interest must be distributed to the Participant's beneficiary in a manner satisfying one of the following:
(A)
If distributions are to be made to the beneficiary over a period which will end after the end of the sixth calendar year ending on or after the death of the Participant, then such payments must commence by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant died and must be paid over a period which does not exceed the life expectancy of the beneficiary and which complies with the requirements of Subsection (b) below.
(B)
The entire amount owed to the beneficiary must be paid to the beneficiary before the end of the fifth calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant died.
However, if distributions have commenced to the Participant before the Participant's death, distributions to the Participant's beneficiary may continue according to the option selected by the Participant. In the event benefit payments are required to commence to a Participant under this Section and the payments are made pursuant to a form of benefit payment elected by the Participant, payments under this Section shall not reduce future benefit payments. However, if a Participant continues accruing Service after payments commence under this Section, a Participant's Accrued Benefit shall be redetermined as of each December 31st in which additional benefits accrued and such Accrued Benefit shall be reduced by the Equivalent Actuarial Value of benefits previously paid. Such adjusted Accrued Benefit shall be used for the purposes of determining payments required to be made after such December 31st.
(n)
Distribution Requirements.
Notwithstanding anything in this Plan or any Appendix to the contrary, distributions under this Plan shall be adjusted, if necessary, for good faith compliance with Code Section 401(a)(9) and Regulations issued under such Code Section, including the minimum distribution incidental death benefit requirements of proposed Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-2.

In the event the Fund Administrator purchases a Nontransferable Annuity contract for the benefit of a Participant, the Fund Administrator may either assign the contract to the Participant or hold the contract for the benefit of the Participant pursuant to the instructions of the Plan Administrator. The Fund Administrator also may purchase a Nontransferable Annuity contract for the benefit of a Beneficiary or Surviving Spouse entitled to a distribution of all or a portion of the Participant's Nonforfeitable Accrued Benefit.

Effective November 7, 1989, a Participant's monthly benefit payments under the Plan (regardless of whether it is payable on account of his Normal Retirement, Early Retirement, Deferred Vested Retirement or Disability Retirement) shall be reduced by the amount of any Workers' Compensation payments made to the Participant arising from the employment relationship with the Employer or, effective June 7, 1994, any federal Social Security Disability payments made to the Participant. Upon discontinuance of Workers Compensation or Social Security Disability payments, the offset shall discontinue and the Participant shall be entitled to receive amounts as originally calculated under the Plan.
If the Participant dies, the monthly benefit otherwise payable to the Beneficiary, if any, shall be reduced by the amount of the monthly Workers' Compensation or Social Security Disability payments made to the Beneficiary, to the extent that such Workers' Compensation or Social Security Disability payments are attributable to Participant.
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 11.09, any benefit payable under this Plan that is a refund of Participant Contributions plus Compound Interest shall not be reduced on account of any Workers' Compensation or Social Security Disability payments.

ARTICLE 12 - LIMITATIONS ON BENEFITS
Refer to Section 12.05 for the definitions of certain terms used in this Article 12. This Article 12 shall be effective beginning January 1, 1987.

12.01. - General Rule.
The Annual Benefit payable under this Plan to a Participant at any time shall not exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount. "Maximum Permissible Amount" shall mean the lesser of (i) $90,000 ($210,000, effective for Limitation Years beginning on and after January 1, 2015), as adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for each calendar year, with the new limitation to apply to Limitation Years ending within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment (the "Dollar Limitation"); or (ii) for Limitation Years beginning prior to January 1, 1995, 100% of the Participant's average Compensation for the period of three consecutive years during which the Participant has the highest aggregate Compensation from the Employer.
( Ord. No. O-15-0062, § 1, 12-15-2015 )
12.02 - Reduction for Less than Ten Years of Participation or Employment.
If the Annual Benefit commences when the Participant has less than ten years of participation in this Plan or any predecessor plan to this Plan, the Dollar Limitation shall be reduced by one-tenth for each year less than ten, but in no event shall be less than one-tenth of the unreduced Dollar Limitation.
( Ord. No. O-15-0062, § 1, 12-15-2015 )
12.03 - Adjustment if the Annual Benefit Commences Before Age 62 or After Age 65.
If the payment of benefits under this Plan commences before age 62 or after age 65, the Dollar Limitation shall be adjusted as provided in this Section 12.03.
Generally, the age-adjusted Dollar Limitation is the actuarial equivalent of the Dollar Limitation payable at age 62 or age 65, as calculated under (i) or (ii) following, whichever is applicable:
(i) If the age at which the benefit is payable is less than 62:
If the Annuity Starting Date for the Participant's benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning before July 1, 2007, the Dollar Limitation for the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of the Dollar Limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than 10, if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (1) the interest rate specified in the Plan for adjusting benefits for early commencement and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the Plan; or (2) a 5-percent interest rate assumption and the Applicable Mortality Table as defined in the Plan.
If the Annuity Starting Date for the Participant's benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the Dollar Limitation for the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of the Dollar Limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than 10, if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using a 5 percent interest rate assumption and the Applicable Mortality Table for the Annuity Starting Date as defined in the Plan (and expressing the Participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the Annuity Starting Date).
If the Annuity Starting Date for the Participant's benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the Dollar Limitation for the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is the lesser of the limitation determined under subsection (i) and the Dollar Limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than 10, if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this section
Effective on and after January 1, 1997, if a Participant is a "qualified participant" as defined under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b)(2)(G), such Participant may retire before age sixty-two (62), without a reduction in the Dollar Limitation if at least fifteen (15) years of service is required to receive a full benefit under the Plan.
(ii) If the age at which the benefit is payable is greater than age 65:
If the Annuity Starting Date for the Participant's benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning before July 1, 2007, the Dollar Limitation for the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of the Dollar Limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than 10, if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (1) the interest rate specified in the Plan and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified the Plan; or (2) a 5-percent interest rate assumption and the Applicable Mortality Table.
If the Annuity Starting Date for the Participant's benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the Dollar Limitation at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of the Dollar Limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than 10, if required), with actuarial equivalence computed using a 5 percent interest rate assumption and the Applicable Mortality Table for that Annuity Starting Date (and expressing the Participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the Annuity Starting Date).
If the Annuity Starting Date for the Participant's benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a Limitation Year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the Dollar Limitation at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is the lesser of the limitation determined under subsection (i) above, and the Dollar Limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than 10, if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this Section. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the Participant, computed disregarding the Participant's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the Plan to a hypothetical Participant who is age 65 and has the same accrued benefit as the Participant.
( Ord. No. O-15-0062, § 1, 12-15-2015 )
12.04 - Special Rules.

For purposes of the maximum limitations of this Article, all defined benefit plans maintained by the Employer shall be considered as a single defined benefit plan, and all defined contribution plans maintained by the Employer shall be considered a single defined contribution plan.
(b)
Combined plan limitations. If the Employer maintains, or has at any time maintained, one or more qualified defined contribution plans covering any Participant in this Plan, the sum of the Participant's Defined Contribution Fraction and Defined Benefit Fraction shall not exceed 1.0 in any limitation year, and the annual benefit otherwise payable to the Participant under this Plan, and not the defined contribution plan, shall be frozen or reduced to the extent necessary so that the sum of such fractions shall not exceed 1.0.

(f)
Protection of TRA '86 Benefits. In the case of an individual who was a Participant as of the first day of the first Limitation Year beginning after December 31, 1986, the application of the limitations of this article shall not cause the maximum permissible amount for such individual under all such defined benefit plans to be less than the individual's Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA '86) accrued benefit.
(g)

12.05 - Definitions.
For purposes of this Article 12, the following definitions shall apply:
(a)
" Annual Additions " means the sum of the following amounts credited to a Participant's account under a defined contribution plan for the limitation year:
(i)
Employer contributions;
(ii)
Forfeitures;
(iii)
Nondeductible employee contributions; provided, however, that the annual addition for any limitation year beginning before January 1, 1987 shall not be recomputed to treat nondeductible employee contributions as an annual addition; and
(iv)
Amounts described in Internal Revenue Code Sections 415(1)(1) and 419A(d)(2).
(b)
" Annual Benefit " means effective January 1, 1998, a retirement benefit under the Plan which is payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity. If a Participant's benefit is payable in a Non-Annuity Benefit Form, whether as the normal form of benefit or as an optional form which the Participant or his Beneficiary elects, the Non-Annuity Benefit Form is adjusted to an Annual Benefit as described below. No actuarial adjustment to the Non-Annuity Benefit Form is required for (i) the value of a qualified joint and survivor annuity; (ii) the value of benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a disability benefit, pre-retirement death benefits, and post-retirement medical benefits); or (iii) the value of post-retirement cost-of-living increases provided that the amount payable to the Participant under the Non-Annuity Benefit Form in any limitation year cannot be greater than the Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and Section 1.415(d)-1 of the Treasury Regulations. The determination of the Annual Benefit shall disregard benefits attributable to employee contributions or rollover contributions or the assets transferred from a qualified plan that was not maintained by an Employer.
Effective for distributions in Limitation Years beginning after December 31, 2003, the determination of actuarial equivalence for Non-Annuity Benefit Forms shall be made in accordance with the following.
(i)
Limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007. For Limitation Years beginning before July 1, 2007, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the participant's form of benefit computed using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount: (I) the interest rate and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in Article I of the plan for adjusting benefits in the same form; and (II) a 5 percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table defined in Article I of the Plan for that annuity starting date. With respect to annuity starting dates on or after January 1, 2004, and prior to January 1, 2006, the five and one half percent (5.5%) shall be substituted for 5 percent for purposes of any adjustment of a benefit subject to Code Section 417(e)(3).
(ii)
Limitation Years beginning on or after July 1, 2007. For Limitation Years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greater of (1) the annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the participant under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the participant's form of benefit; and (2) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the participant's form of benefit, computed using a 5 percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table defined in Article I of the Plan for that annuity starting date.
(c)
" Applicable Mortality Table " is the table prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, which prior to the first day of the Plan Year beginning on or after January 1, 2008, is the table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 and on and after that date is the applicable Code Section 417(e)(3) mortality table.
(d)
" Compensation " means a Participant's wages as defined in Code Section 3401(a) (wages subject to income tax withholding at the source) but without regard to exceptions contained in Code Section 3401(a) for wages based on the nature of location of the employment or the services performed. For Limitation Years beginning on or after December 31, 1997, for purposes of applying the limitations of this Article, compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in Code Section 402(g)(3)), and any amount which is contributed or deferred by the Employer at the election of the Participant and which is not includible in the gross income of the Participant by reason of Code Section 125 or 457. For Limitation Years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the Participant's gross income by reason of Code Section 132(f) (related to qualified transportation plan). For Limitation Years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation also includes compensation paid by that later of 2 ½ months after the Participant's severance from employment or the end of the Limitation Year that includes the date of the Participant's severance from employment if:
(i)
the payment is regular compensation for services during the Participant's regular working hours or compensation for services outside the Participant's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential) commissions, bonuses or other similar payments and absent a severance from employment, the payment would have been paid to the Participant while he or she continued in employment with the Employer; or
(ii)
the payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation, or the leave that the Participant would have been able to use if employment had continued
The intent of this definition is to comply with the alternative definition of compensation described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415-2(d)(11)(ii).
(e)
" Defined Benefit Fraction " means a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the Participant's Projected Annual Benefits under all the defined benefit plans (whether or not terminated) maintained by the Employer, and the denominator of which is the lesser of (i) 125 percent of the Dollar Limitation in effect for the limitation year under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b)(1)(A); or (ii) 140 percent of the Participant's Highest Average Compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant was a Participant in a plan maintained by the Employer and in existence on July 1, 1982, the denominator of this fraction shall not be less than 125 percent of the sum of the annual benefits under such plans which the Participant had accrued as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before January 1, 1983, but determined without regard to changes in the Plan or cost-of-living increases occurring after July 1, 1982. The preceding sentence applies only if the defined benefit plans individually and in the aggregate satisfied the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 415 for all limitation years beginning before January 1, 1983.
(f)
" Defined Contribution Fraction " means a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the Annual Additions to the Participant's account under all the defined contribution plans (whether or not terminated) maintained by the Employer for the current and all prior limitation years, and the denominator of which is the sum of the maximum aggregate amounts for the current and all prior limitation years of Employment with the Employer (regardless of whether a defined contribution plan was maintained by the Employer).
The maximum aggregate amount in any limitation year is the lesser of (i) 125 percent of the Dollar Limitation in effect under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(c)(1)(A); or (ii) 35 percent of the Participant's Compensation for such year.
If the Employee was a participant in one or more defined contribution plans maintained by the Employer which were in existence on July 1, 1982, the numerator of this fraction shall be adjusted if the sum of this fraction and the defined benefit fraction would otherwise exceed 1.0 under the terms of this Plan. Under the adjustment, an amount equal to the product of (1) the excess of the sum of the fractions over 1.0 times and (2) the denominator of this fraction, will be permanently subtracted from the numerator of this fraction. The adjustment is calculated using the fractions as they would be computed as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before January 1, 1983.
(g)
" Employer " means the Macon-Bibb County, Georgia.
(h)
Limitation Year means the calendar year.
(i)
" Projected Annual Benefit " means the annual benefit to which the Participant would be entitled under the terms of the Plan assuming (i) the Participant will continue Employment until Normal Retirement Age under the Plan (or current age, if later), and (ii) the Participant's Compensation for the current limitation year and all other relevant factors used to determine benefits under the Plan will remain constant for all future limitation years.
(j)
" RPA '94 Old Law Benefit " means the Participant's Accrued Benefit under the terms of the Plan as of December 31, 1999, (the RPA '94 freeze date), for the Annuity Starting Date and optional form and taking into account the limitations of Code Section 415 as in effect on December 7, 1994, including the participation requirements under Code Section 415. In determining the amount of a Participant's RPA '94 old law benefit, the following shall be disregarded:
(i)
any Plan amendment increasing benefits adopted after the RPA '94 freeze date; and
(ii)
any cost of living adjustments that become effective after such date.
A Participant's RPA '94 old law benefit is not increased after the RPA '94 freeze date, but if the limitations of Code Section 415, as in effect on December 7, 1994, are less than the limitations that were applied to determine the Participant's RPA '94 old law benefit on the RPA '94 freeze date, then the Participant's RPA '94 old law benefit will be reduced in accordance with such reduced limitation. If, at any date after the RPA '94 freeze date, the Participant's total plan benefit, before the application of Section 415, is less than the Participant's RPA '94 old law benefit, the RPA '94 old law benefit will be reduced to the Participant's total plan benefit.
(k)
" RPA '94 Old Law Benefit " means the Participant's Accrued Benefit under the terms of the Plan as of December 31, 1999, (the RPA '94 freeze date), for the annuity starting date and optional form and taking into account the limitations of Code Section 415 as in effect on December 7, 1994, including the participation requirements under Code Section 415. In determining the amount of a Participant's RPA '94 old law benefit, the following shall be disregarded:
(i)
any Plan amendment increasing benefits adopted after the RPA '94 freeze date; and
(ii)
any cost of living adjustments that become effective after such date.
A Participant's RPA '94 old law benefit is not increased after the RPA '94 freeze date, but if the limitations of Code Section 415, as in effect on December 7, 1994, are less than the limitations that were applied to determine the Participant's RPA '94 old law benefit on the RPA '94 freeze date, then the Participant's RPA '94 old law benefit will be reduced in accordance with such reduced limitation. If, at any date after the RPA '94 freeze date, the Participant's total plan benefit, before the application of Section 415, is less than the Participant's RPA '94 old law benefit, the RPA '94 old law benefit will be reduced to the Participant's total plan benefit.
(l)
" TRA '86 accrued benefit " means a Participant's accrued benefit under the Plan, determined as if the Participant had separated from service as of the close of the last limitation year beginning before January 1, 1987, when expressed as an annual benefit within the meaning of Code Section 415(b)(2).

If these two conditions are met, the portion of a year of participation credited to the Participant shall equal the amount of benefit accrual service credited to the Participant for such accrual computation period. A Participant who is permanently and totally disabled within the meaning of Code Section 415(c)(3)(C)(i) for an accrual computation period shall receive a year of participation with respect to that period.

Description of Enhanced Benefits.

Therefore, the Participant's benefit shall be based upon the Participant's service and his average compensation as of December 31, 2015, times 2.25%; provided, however an enhanced Early Retirement Pension shall be subject to the reductions as provided in Section 6.02 of the Plan.

(e)
7-Day Revocation Period.
A Participant electing to retire early under the ERIP may revoke his or her election by providing written notice of the revocation to the designated individual within seven (7) days after he or she submitted the election form (the revocation period).

If a Participant dies before commencement of benefits under this ERIP, the Participant's election to participate in the ERIP shall be null and void, notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary.

The election to retire and receive enhanced early retirement benefits pursuant to the ERIP shall be completely voluntary.
The effective date of this provision is May 31, 2015.
