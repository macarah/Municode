SECTION 1.
(a)
The governmental and corporate powers, duties, and functions now vested in the City of Macon, a municipal corporation created by an Act of the General Assembly, approved March 23, 1977 (Ga. L. 1977, p. 3776), as amended, are restructured with the governmental and corporate powers, duties, and functions of the County of Bibb, such restructuring of the governments of the City of Macon and the County of Bibb being pursuant to the constitutional power granted by Article IX, Section III, Paragraph II of the Constitution of Georgia, as amended. Said restructuring shall result in the establishment of a single county-wide government with powers and jurisdiction throughout the territorial limits of Bibb County, which single government shall supersede and replace the governments of the City of Macon and the County of Bibb, and, to the extent provided in this charter, shall also supersede and replace any public authorities and special service districts located and operating within Bibb County. Said county-wide government shall be a new political entity, a body politic and corporate, and a political subdivision of the State of Georgia, to be known as 'Macon-Bibb County' (in this charter at times called 'the restructured government'), having all of the governmental and corporate powers, duties, and functions heretofore held by and vested in the City of Macon and Bibb County, and also the powers, duties, and functions provided in this charter. The restructured government shall be a public corporation; shall have perpetual existence; shall, without the necessity or formality of a deed, bill of sale, or other instrument of transfer, own, possess, and hold all properties of whatsoever kind or nature, assets, contracts, franchises, things, rights, privileges, immunities, and real and personal property theretofore owned, possessed, enjoyed, or held by the City of Macon and the County of Bibb; by the name of Macon-Bibb County shall be able to contract and be contracted with, sue and be sued as provided by this charter, plead and be impleaded in all courts of this state, and do all other acts relating to its corporate capacity; and shall be able in law and equity to purchase, have and hold, receive, enjoy, accept, possess, and retain for the use and benefit of said Macon-Bibb County, in perpetuity or for any term of years, any estate or estates, real or personal, lands, tenements, or hereditaments of whatsoever kind or nature inside or outside the territorial limits of the restructured government, as may be devised, bequeathed, sold, or by any manner conveyed or dedicated to or otherwise acquired by the restructured government and to use, manage, improve, sell and convey, rent, or lease same; and to have and use a common seal. From and after the effective date of this charter, the political subdivision known as Bibb County, Georgia, and the municipal corporation known as the City of Macon shall be merged into the said new political entity created in this charter.
(b)
The territory embraced in the restructured government shall be the total area of Bibb County, as the same may be now or hereafter fixed and established by law, excluding the geographic area encompassed within the boundaries of the City of Payne City. Any portion of the City of Macon as it exists on December 31, 2013, which extends in to any other county shall not be included in the territory of the restructured government and shall on January 1, 2014, become unincorporated land of the county in which it is located.
