Every councilman shall address the chair. A councilman once recognized shall not be interrupted while speaking unless called to order by the presiding officer, unless a point of order is raised by another member, or unless the speaker chooses to yield to questions from another member. If a councilman is called to order while he is speaking, he shall cease speaking immediately until the question of order is determined. If ruled to be in order, he shall be permitted to proceed. If ruled to be not in order, he shall remain silent or shall alter his remarks so as to comply with rules of the council.

Councilmen shall confine their questions to the particular matters before the assembly and in debate shall confine their remarks to the issues before the council. Members shall be removed from the meeting for failure to comply with decisions of the presiding officer or for continued violations of the rules of the council.

Members of the administrative staff and employees of the city shall observe the same rules of procedure and decorum applicable to members of the council. Any nonmember of the council desiring to address the council shall be recognized by the chair, shall state his name and address for the record, and shall limit his remarks to the matter under discussion.

No staff member, other than the staff member having the floor, shall enter into any discussion either directly or indirectly without permission of the presiding officer.
(c)
Members of the public attending council meetings also shall observe the same rules of propriety, decorum, and good conduct applicable to members of the council.

Unauthorized remarks from the audience, stamping of feet, whistles, yells, and similar demonstrations shall not be permitted by the presiding officer, who shall direct the removal of such offenders from the room. Aggravated cases shall be prosecuted on appropriate complaint signed by the presiding officer. In case the presiding officer shall fail to act, any member of the council may move to require him to act to enforce the rules, and the affirmative vote of the majority of the council shall require the presiding officer to act.

No person other than members of the council and the person having the floor shall enter into any discussion either directly or through a member of the council without the permission of the presiding officer.

(Code 1976, § 2-1024)

When repeated without intervening business or discussion;
(2)

To postpone indefinitely. The several motions listed in this subsection shall have precedence in the order in which they stand arranged.
(f)
When a proper motion is made, but information is wanted, the appropriate motion is to postpone to a day certain.
(g)
When matters claiming present attention but which should be reserved for a more suitable occasion are presented, the appropriate motion is to lay on the table; the matter may then be called for at any time. If the proposition may need further consideration at the hands of the committee, the appropriate motion is to refer to a committee, but if it needs but a few and simple amendments, the council shall proceed to consider and amend at once.
(h)
On an amendment being moved, a member who has spoken on the main question may speak again to the amendment.
(i)
The question is to be put first on the affirmative and then on the negative side. After the affirmative part of the question has been put, any member who has not spoken before to the question may speak before the negative be put, because it is no full question until the negative side be put.
(Code 1976, § 2-1033)
