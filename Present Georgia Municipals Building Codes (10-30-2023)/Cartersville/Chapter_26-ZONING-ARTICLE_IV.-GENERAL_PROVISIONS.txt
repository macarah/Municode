Excludes noncommercial amateur radio antennas, towers, and supporting structures.
D.
The application for a communication tower shall include, but not be limited to, the following information:
1.
A survey site plan drawn to scale showing all property lines with dimensions, location of existing buildings and other structures, topography, location of setback lines or other dimensional requirements, proposed tower location, tower height, location of accessory structures to the tower, proposed landscaping, neighboring uses, north arrow, and property street number;
2.
The coverage zone of the proposed tower;

A report, documented by the submission of a certification by a qualified engineer, showing evidence of an engineering nature which demonstrates that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the proposed antenna(s). Said report shall include, but not be limited to, the following information:
a.
No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements;
b.
Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements;
c.
Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment;
d.
The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna;
e.
The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable (costs exceeding new tower development are considered to be unreasonable); or
f.
