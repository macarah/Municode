Policy.

All hydrants shall be flowed and tested in accordance with approved practices of I.S.O., AWWA and the NFPA. At the conclusion of such a test of the water system it shall determine the GPM flow for that hydrant. Hydrants then will be color coded in the following fashion in accordance NFPA 291:

GPM flow 1500 + - Safety Blue
Out of Service - Safety Yellow
Trim of bonnet: Silver or White Reflective (if available)
  NOTE: Color coding is only descriptive of what the GPM flow was at the time of the last documented test. It in no way guarantees that the hydrant will flow that GPM at the time of an incident and does not take into account any high demands, broken mains, closed valves or other events that could affect the GPM flow. Color coding is only used as a general reference to what the potential flow may be at any given time and citizens and staff shall be aware and prepared for GPM changes.
(2)
Special colors: If a non-national standard thread hydrant is located, caps are to be painted gloss black. All out of service hydrants shall be solid yellow with no reflective strip until placed in service or removed. All private hydrants are to be painted a solid red barrels, bonnets and caps.
