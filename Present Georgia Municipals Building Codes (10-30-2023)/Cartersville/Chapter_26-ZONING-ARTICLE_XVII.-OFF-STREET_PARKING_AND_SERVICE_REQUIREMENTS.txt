ARTICLE XVII. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 17.1. - Scope of provisions.
Except as provided in this section, no application for a building permit shall be approved unless there is included with the plan for such building, improvements, or use, a plat plan showing the required space reserved for off-street parking and service purposes. Occupancy shall not be allowed unless the required off-street parking and service facilities have been provided in accordance with those shown on the approved plan. These provisions shall not apply to the DBD district.
Sec. 17.2. - Drainage, construction, and maintenance.
In nonsingle-family districts, all off-street parking, loading, and service areas shall be drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties and/or public streets and shall be paved with a material such as concrete, asphalt or pavers which will assure a surface resistant to erosion. Outdoor storage yards and less traveled interior drives in commercial and industrial areas may be surfaced with gravel; the use of impervious surface materials such as concrete or asphalt is discouraged on outdoor storage yards and less traveled interior drives because of increased stormwater runoff associated with such paving materials. Driveways and parking spaces for all single-family uses shall be surfaced with an all-weather surface material (e.g., gravel, pavers, concrete, or asphalt); when gravel is used as a surface material on driveways serving single-family uses, a concrete or asphalt paved apron shall be required to meet the road; said apron shall have a minimum length of five (5) feet. All such areas shall be at all times maintained at the expense of the owners thereof, in a clean, orderly, and dust-free condition.
Sec. 17.3. - Separation from walkways, sidewalks, and landscaped areas.
All off-street parking, loading, and service areas shall be separated from walkways, sidewalks and landscaped areas by concrete curbing or bumper blocks. Curbing located in parking areas shall be constructed a minimum of five (5) feet from private and/or public property lines.
Sec. 17.4. - Joint parking facilities.
Two (2) or more neighboring uses, of the same or different types, may provide joint facilities, provided that the number of off-street parking spaces are not less than the sum of the individual requirements.
Sec. 17.5. - Pavement markings and signs.
Each off-street parking space shall be clearly marked, and directional arrows or signs shall be provided whenever necessary. Markers, directional arrows, and signs shall be properly maintained so as to ensure their maximum efficiency (excludes required parking spaces for single-family uses).
Sec. 17.6. - Number of parking spaces.
In order to ensure a proper and uniform development of public parking areas throughout the area of jurisdiction of this chapter, to relieve traffic congestion on the streets, to lessen the amount of impervious surface in the city, and to minimize any detrimental effects on adjacent properties, off-street parking space shall be provided and maintained as called for in the following sections. For any use or class of use not mentioned in this section, the requirements shall be the same as similar use as mentioned herein.
Any decrease in the number of parking spaces required by this section must be approved by either the zoning administrator under the administrative variance procedures or by the board of zoning appeals under the variance procedures set forth by this chapter.
