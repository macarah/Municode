(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97)
Sec. 24-116. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(a)
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste under 40 CFR 26 1, EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user; an identification of the constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph needs to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notification of changed conditions must be submitted under section 24-112 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 24-108, 24-110, and 24-111 of this article.
(b)
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes, as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d), 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(c)
In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
(d)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(e)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97)
Sec. 24-117. - Analytical requirements.

If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97)
Sec. 24-118. - Sample collection.
(a)
Except as indicated in subsection (b) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(b)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97)

Sec. 24-142. - Upset.
(a)
For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(b)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) below are met.
(c)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(1)
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
(2)
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with operation and maintenance procedures; and
(3)
The user has submitted the following information to the superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days):
a.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause;
b.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
c.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(d)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(e)
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(f)
Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97)
Sec. 24-143. - Prohibited discharge standards.

(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or
(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(b)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section.
(c)
(1)
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(2)
A user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
(d)
(1)
Bypass is prohibited and the superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
a.
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
b.
There was no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment down time. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment down time or preventive maintenance; and
c.
The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section.
(2)
The superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the superintendent determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

DIVISION 14. - WASTEWATER TREATMENT RATES

Sec. 24-145. - Generally.
(a)
A permit from the city shall be obtained before a sewer tap is made, and such permit shall indicate that the prescribed fee has been made.
(b)
Any unauthorized person making a tap shall be punished upon conviction of an offense.
(c)
Nothing in this section shall prevent the installation of sewer lines by assessments of abutting property that have been duly petitioned, advertised and approved by the council and in the same manner as assessments are made for paving streets.
(d)
Cut on and cut-off service charges for water and gas utilities inside and outside the city shall be fixed by the council. Meters shall be read when service is cut on. If service is restored for the same customer, any service used during the off period will be billed at twice the applicable rate as a penalty.
(e)
Nonwater customers and those obtaining water from wells using the city sewer system are required to meter well pumpage and shall be charged the regular sewer service fees. The property owners shall pay the cost of the meter and installation by the water department.
(f)
Fees associated with excessive discharges of conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, COD) may or may not be punitive as deemed by the city.
(g)
Fines for conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, COD) can be waived, provided no harm occurred to the POTW, at the discretion of the city on a case-by-case basis.
(h)
Wastewater discharges between three hundred (300) mg/L and eight hundred fifty (850) mg/L of BOD will be assessed a surcharge. Enforcement shall be initiated for BOD discharges exceeding eight hundred fifty (850) mg/L. Wastewater discharges between three hundred (300) mg/L and one thousand five hundred (1,500) mg/L of TSS will be assessed a surcharge. Enforcement shall be initiated for TSS discharges exceeding one thousand five hundred (1,500) mg/L. The purpose of the surcharge is to encourage treatment of wastes rather than relying on the POTW to handle excess BOD and/or TSS, and to require industries generating high strength waste to bear the cost.
(1)
For samples with a difficult BOD to measure accurately, chemical oxygen demand (COD) may be substituted for BOD analysis. Wastewater discharges between seven hundred fifty (750) and two thousand five hundred (2,500) mg/L of COD will be assessed a surcharge. Enforcement shall be initiated for discharges exceeding two thousand five hundred (2,500) mg/L.

Sec. 24-148. - Low pressure systems.
(1)
Preamble:
WHEREAS, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found low pressure sewer systems to have increased energy demands, higher maintenance requirements, and greater costs for homeowners; and
WHEREAS, the mayor and city council deems it to be in the best interest of the citizens of the City of Cartersville to adopt additional regulations governing low pressure systems and permissible residential systems in general,
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED AND IT IS HEREBY ORDAINED, by virtue of the authority vested in the city council by law that the following waste treatment ordinance be adopted:
(2)
Waste treatment ordinance—Purpose: It is the purpose of this section to regulate the available types of waste treatment options for individual uses in the City of Cartersville. The City of Cartersville has experience with individual septic systems and traditional gravity flow systems, and such systems are appropriate for the city. Under more limited circumstances, private sewage facilities may be permitted. The City of Cartersville recognizes that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found low-pressure sewer systems to have increased energy demands, higher maintenance requirements, and higher costs to the homeowner. The city has further determined that the ongoing maintenance issues created by such systems lead to greater future problems than in a conventional gravity flow sewer system. Such systems have many more mechanical and powered parts and are therefore subject to much higher failure rates. Preventative maintenance requirements are higher and power outages can result in overflows and damage to residences. Life cycle replacement costs are higher than gravity sewers. Therefore, this section is adopted to regulate and prohibit such systems, in the interest of protecting the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Cartersville.
(3)
Definitions: As used in this division, words shall have their common meaning and significance, except for the specifically defined terms below:
(a)
Effluent: The flow of liquids and solids from a structure's sewage plumbing system; e.g., human waste, waste water, etc.
(b)
Low pressure sewer system: A sewer system that uses pressure to move the effluent from individual lots to the main sewer lines. Pressure sewers typically break down large solids in a pumping station located on an individual lost before they are transported through the collection system (sewer mains) to the treatment facility. Such systems include grinder pump systems and septic tank effluent pump systems. Systems which use a pump-to-pump waste from a septic tank to a septic field on the same lot are not included in this definition.
(c)
Low pressure sewer system cluster: A pressure sewer system with a common low-pressure line that connects several residences by individual pumps to a central or common pump station.
(d)
Private sewage facility means a privately owned sewage treatment facility providing sewage disposal to property owned only by a single owner. Examples would include a facility serving a single industrial site, or a facility serving a mobile home park where all lots are owned by a single owner.
(e)
Public sewage facility means a sewage treatment facility providing sewage disposal to more than one (1) property owned by different owners. Examples would include a facility serving an industrial park with several owners, or a facility serving a subdivision with separate homeowners.
(4)
Regulation of waste treatment facilities:
(a)
Low-pressure sewer systems (including low pressure sewer system clusters) are prohibited in the City of Cartersville. Individual residential lots are required to be connected to a public gravity flow sewer system.
(b)
Sewage treatment and handling systems for individual residential lots not otherwise covered or defined specifically by this section, or as may be invested in the future, shall only be permitted upon approval of the water superintendent. The applicant shall submit an application as required by the city, containing plans, specifications and other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the superintendent. The superintendent shall not permit systems or technologies that are unproven, that increase the risks of environmental contamination, that do not meet the standards contained in the City of Cartersville Code of Ordinances or standards as may be adopted by the City of Cartersville Water Department or other applicable ordinance, that increase costs or burdens on the city's sewer system or to individual property owners, or that are found to be a threat in any way to the health, safety or welfare of the citizens of the city.
(5)
Interpretation: It shall be the duty of the City of Cartersville Water Superintendent to classify proposed systems. If there is a question as to the type of system proposed, or whether it is permitted or prohibited, the superintendent shall make the final interpretation for the water department. His determination may be appealed to the city manager.
(Ord. No. 27-05, § 1, 4-21-05)
Sec. 24-149. - Unauthorized water usage.
Unauthorized water usage through detector check meters for services larger than two (2) inches will be charged at ten (10) times the normal water and sewer rate. Unauthorized water usage through detector check meters for service two (2) inches and smaller will be charged at the normal water and sewer rate.
(Ord. No. 98-04, § 4, 12-1-05)
