Chapter 29 - OUTDOOR LIGHTING AND GLARE STANDARDS

Sec. 29-1. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety, nighttime vision, natural-resource conservation, community values and aesthetics by establishing standards for the design and application of outdoor-lighting sources and fixtures for nighttime use. Accordingly, the specific regulatory objectives of this chapter are as follows:
(a)
Promote nighttime visibility by directing appropriate levels of illumination upon intended targets.
(b)
Redress the disabling visual effects of glare and excessive illumination, and the extreme contrasts between brightly lighted areas and the lower ambient levels of adjacent areas.
(c)
Limit light trespass across property lines, and its intrusive and devaluing effects upon nearby private and public property.
(d)
Protect air and water quality, and conserve natural resources.
(e)
Limit light pollution for the following purposes:
(1)
Restore natural cycles of light and dark to the indigenous natural environment, thereby redressing a cause of impaired vegetative growth and wildlife habitat; and
(2)
Darken the night sky by reducing the unnecessary transmission of upward lightâ€”both directly from an unshielded light source and indirectly from ground-level reflections of excessive downward light.
(f)
Enhance public safety in public rights-of-way.

Sec. 29-2. - Definitions.
Direct burial ground fixture. Upward directed lighting assembly that is installed such that the lens or outermost portion of the fixture is flush with the grade of the ground or surrounding surface in which it is installed.
Direct light. Light or illumination emitted directly from a fixture's light source, including the lens and globes associated with the fixture.
Fixture. Complete lighting assembly consisting of a lamp or lamps, together with the parts designed to power, position, house, and protect the lamp; and other parts (such as a lens, reflector, or globe) which function together with the lamp as a light source to emit, control, direct, and disperse light. Not included is the support assembly (pole, arm, or mounting bracket) to which the lighting unit is attached. If multiple lighting units are attached to a common support assembly, each unit shall be considered to be an individual lighting fixture. A fixture with multiple lamps comprises only a single fixture.
Footcandle. Measure of illumination equivalent to one lumen produced uniformly on a surface of one square foot, as measured by a light meter.
Glare. Effect caused by light sufficiently greater than that to which the eye is readily adapted, such that annoyance, physical discomfort, or visual impairment is experienced by an observer.
Lamp. Component, tube, or bulb of a lighting fixture that produces the light. Multiple lamps within a single fixture are lumen-rated cumulatively as if a single lamp.
Light pollution. A general expression for any and all uncontained light, both directed and reflected, that increases ambient light.
Light source. The point of origin from which illumination emanates; usually a lamp.
Light trespass. Intrusion of direct light projected from one property or roadway onto another property or roadway.
Lumen. Unit of illumination measuring the rate at which a lamp emits light where one lumen per square foot is one footcandle.
Outdoor lighting. Illumination of an exterior area. Included are open air spaces which are under a roof or other cover and not fully enclosed, such as a canopy, pavilion, drive-through bay, or parking deck.
Roadway. Street, including the right-of-way, as defined elsewhere in section 1-2 ("street"), whether for public or private use.
( Ord. No. 2020-32 , 1-4-2021)
Sec. 29-3. - Applicability.
(a)
New or altered installation. Except as specified otherwise herein, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to all affixed (non-mobile), outdoor lighting fixtures as follows:
(1)
Fixtures newly permitted and installed after the effective date of this chapter;
(2)
Existing fixtures if electrically altered with respect to lamp type to provide an increase in wattage, temperature, or lumen output, or if structurally modified, replaced, repaired, or relocated after the effective date of this chapter;
(3)
All fixtures illegally installed at any time; and
(4)
Any lighting, existing or new, must comply with this chapter when proposed in association with additional structural or site improvement square footage added to an existing structure or site improvement that is greater than 25 percent of the existing building square footage for structural improvements or 25 percent of the existing site improvement square footage for site improvements.
(b)
Resumption of use after abandonment. Nonconforming lots, buildings and uses, relating to abandonment or discontinued use of nonconforming uses and structures. All outdoor lighting on the site shall be reviewed and brought into compliance with this chapter before use of the structure or its site is permitted to be resumed.
( Ord. No. 2020-32 , 1-4-2021)
Sec. 29-4. - Outdoor lighting standards.
(a)
Glare and directional control.
(1)
Full shielding required. All outdoor lighting fixtures shall be horizontally cutoff or otherwise fully shielded, and shall comply with the terms of this chapter with respect to lighting intensity, glare, and trespass, except as specified otherwise herein.
(2)
Diffused-light exception in residential zones. Full shielding to control glare and light trespass is not required in residential zones.
(b)
Light trespass. The following light-trespass standard shall apply to all outdoor fixtures not located within a public right-of-way. The standard can be achieved by means of fixture design, metal shielding, lamp type and lumen output, mounting height, location, or natural or constructed barriers on the subject property.
(1)
Light-trespass standard. Outdoor-lighting fixtures shall be shielded such that light of one footcandle or greater is not transmitted over the property line of the subject property by more than ten feet in residential zones, by no more than 20 feet in any other zone, or to the wall of the nearest structure on the immediately adjacent property is located at a distance that is less than those listed in this section.
(c)
Intensity of illumination. Outdoor sites shall not be illuminated in excess of the standards for lighting levels specified in Table 1, below for specific zones and classes of use or application, measured in footcandle units and based upon the initial lumen-output rating of the fixture lamps. Compliance shall be demonstrated by detailed descriptions, specifications, and photometric plans or studies, as determined by the community development director.
