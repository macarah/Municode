ARTICLE 15. - SPECIAL USE REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 15-1. - Special uses.
new
Special uses are generally consistent with the purpose of the zoning district in which they are permitted but, due to unique operational characteristics, may not be desirable or compatible in all locations. Factors such as traffic, hours of operation, noise, odor or similar potential effects require that the special use be evaluated relative to its appropriateness on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, special uses may be permitted within a zoning district, with city approval, following a review of the use and its potential impact on its surroundings. This article establishes the review procedures for special uses and the general standards that must be met for all special uses. Some specific uses are also subject to additional standards and requirements to mitigate their potential negative impacts.
Sec. 15-2. - Scope.
new
A special use shall be permitted only when the city council has approved the proposed use and the associated site plan, after a review and recommendation by the planning and zoning board, as provided by this article and other applicable provisions of this ordinance. Except as otherwise expressly provided by this ordinance, the general procedures, standards, and requirements in this article shall apply to all special uses and shall be in addition to any other requirements applicable to particular special uses listed in this article. In those cases where the specific requirements of this article are more restrictive than other provisions of this ordinance, the special use requirements shall apply.

Sec. 15-34. - Sexually-oriented businesses.
new
A.
Intent. In the development and execution of these zoning regulations, it is recognized that some uses, because of their very nature, may have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby causing a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. The proximity of sexually oriented businesses to certain uses considered particularly susceptible to the negative impacts of the concentration of sexually oriented uses tends to erode the quality of life, adversely affect property values, disrupt business investment, encourage residents and businesses to move or avoid the community, increase crime, and contribute to a blighting effect on the surrounding area. There is convincing documented evidence of the deleterious effect that sexually oriented businesses have on both existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas to which they be adjacent. Therefore, the following intents are served by these regulations:
1.
This section describes the uses regulated and the specific standards necessary to ensure that the adverse effects of these uses will not contribute to the deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood, to prevent undesirable concentration of these uses, and to require sufficient spacing from uses considered most susceptible to negative impacts.
2.
These provisions are not intended, nor shall they have the effect of, imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including, but not limited to, sexually oriented materials that are protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
3.
Additionally, it is not the intent of the provisions of this section, nor shall it have the effect of, restricting or denying access by adults to sexually oriented materials that are protected by said federal and state constitutions.
4.
Further, it is not the intent of these provisions, nor shall they have the effect of, denying access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their target market.
5.
These regulations shall not be interpreted as intending to legitimize any activities that are prohibited by federal or state law, or by any other ordinance of the City of Palmetto.
B.
Uses Regulated. The following uses are regulated by this subsection and defined for purposes of regulating sexually oriented businesses:
1.
Adult arcade.
2.
Adult book store.
3.
Adult cabaret.
4.
Adult motel.
5.
Adult motion picture theater.
C.
Regulations.
1.
No sexually oriented business shall be permitted in a location in which any principal building or accessory structure, including signs, is within 1,320 feet of any principal building or accessory structure of another sexually oriented business.
2.
No sexually oriented business shall be established on a parcel within 1,320 feet of any parcel in a residential district or any parcel used for a single- or multiple-family residence, public park, school, child care facility, church or similar place of worship, public library, city hall, police department or fire department, youth center, or commercially operated school attended by children such as, for example, dance schools, gymnastic centers, etc. The distance between a proposed sexually oriented business and any such zoned area or existing use shall be measured in a straight line from the nearest property line upon which the proposed sexually oriented business is to be located to the nearest property line of that zoned area or existing use.
3.
Any sign or advertising for the sexually oriented business must comply with the provisions of this ordinance. No sign or advertising may include photographs, silhouettes, or drawings of any specified anatomical areas or specified sexual activities, or obscene representations of the human form and may not include animated or flashing illumination.
4.
The entrances to the proposed sexually oriented business at both the exterior and interior walls, in a location visible to those entering and exiting the business, must be clearly marked with lettering at least two inches in height stating:
5.
"Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to enter the premises;" and
6.
"No alcoholic beverages of any type are permitted within the premises."
7.
No product or service for sale or gift, or any picture or other representation of any product or service for sale or gift, shall be displayed so as to be visible by a person of normal visual acuity from the nearest adjoining roadway or a neighboring property.
8.
Hours of operation shall be limited to 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday.
9.
All off street and on-site parking areas shall comply with this ordinance, based on the primary use (i.e., retail, assembly, etc.) and shall additionally be illuminated at all times.
10.
Any booth, room or cubical available in any sexually oriented business that is used by patrons for the viewing of any entertainment shall:
a.
Be unobstructed by any door, lock or other entrance and exit control device;
b.
Have at least one side totally open to a public, lighted aisle so that there is an unobstructed view at all times from the adjoining aisle of any occupant;
c.
Be illuminated such that a person of normal visual acuity looking into the booth, room or cubical from its entrance adjoining the public lighted aisle can clearly determine the number of people within;
d.
Have no holes or openings in any side or rear wall not relating to utility, ventilation or temperature control services or otherwise required by any governmental code or authority.
D.
Conditions of Approval. Prior to granting approval for the establishment of any sexually oriented business, the city council may impose any conditions or limitations upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, or operation of the sexually oriented business which is necessary for the protection of the public interest. Any evidence, bond, or other performance guarantee may be required as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith will be fulfilled.
E.
Access to Minors. No person operating a sexually oriented business shall permit any person under the age of 18 to be on the premises of the business as an employee, customer, or otherwise.
