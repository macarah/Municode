B.
Performance guarantees shall be processed in the following manner:
1.
Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall submit an itemized estimate of the cost of the required improvements which are subject to the performance guarantee, which shall then be reviewed by the zoning administrator.

The city may withhold issuance of the certificate of occupancy until all improvements are completed.

A record of authorized performance guarantees shall be maintained by the zoning administrator.

The municipal court judge shall give the person a full opportunity to be heard and, if the judge finds that a violation has occurred, the judge shall determine the extent and nature of the violation and the appropriate penalty. Where a violation has been determined to exist with respect to a building, structure or premises, the judge may, in addition to other remedies provided by law, require that public utility service be withheld from that premises until the violation is corrected.

The following factors shall be considered by the planning and zoning board and the mayor and council when reviewing a request for rezoning:
1.
Whether or not the proposed zoning is consistent with the vision, goals, policies and future land use designation contained in the community agenda element of the city's comprehensive plan.
2.
Whether the proposed district and all of the uses permitted within that district are compatible with the physical characteristics of the subject site and will be compatible with the existing and intended surrounding uses in terms of density, traffic, noise and scale of development.
3.
Whether, if rezoned, the city is capable of serving the uses allowed, based on the capacity of available infrastructure such as water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, street network, police and fire protection.
4.
Whether the property can be reasonably used as currently zoned.
5.
Whether property values in the immediate vicinity might be expected to be diminished as a result of development of the subject property under the proposed zoning classification.

B.
Nonconforming lots, buildings, structures and uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with the provisions of the districts in which they are located.

Utilities, such as water, gas and electricity to the property, have been disconnected;

The property, buildings, and grounds, have fallen into disrepair;

A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use provided all of the following determinations are made by the zoning board of appeals:
1.
The proposed use shall be as compatible or more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the previous nonconforming use, considering factors such as hours of operation, traffic, noise and similar external impacts.
2.
The proposed nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land or building area than the previous nonconforming use.
3.
That appropriate conditions and safeguards are provided that will ensure compliance with the intent and purpose of this ordinance.
E.
Uses consisting of lots occupied by storage yards, used car lots, auto wrecking, junk yards, golf driving ranges, miniature golf courses and similar open uses, where the only buildings on the property are ancillary to the open use and where the use is nonconforming, shall be subject to the following restrictions, in addition to all other applicable provisions of this article.
1.
When a nonconforming open use of land has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not be used again for any other nonconforming use.

new
A.
Where a lawful building or structure exists at the effective date of this ordinance, or an amendment thereto, that does not comply with the requirements of this ordinance because of restrictions such as lot area, lot coverage, width, height, or setbacks, that building or structure may continue to be occupied and used so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1.
No nonconforming building or structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity, except in cases in which the setback of a building or structure is nonconforming by 50 percent or less of the distance required by this ordinance. Only in these cases may the nonconforming setback be extended along the same plane as the existing nonconforming setback, provided that in so doing, the setback itself is not further reduced.
2.
In the event that a nonconforming building or structure is destroyed to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement value, exclusive of the foundation, it shall be reconstructed only in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance; provided that the zoning board of appeals may, upon application, permit the reconstruction of the nonconforming building or structure if all of the following conditions are met:
a.
The prior nonconforming condition(s) shall not be increased.
b.
All building materials and architectural details shall conform to the requirements of Article 18.
c.
The new building or structure shall be placed on the original foundation, unless the building or structure could be so located as to reduce the extent of its nonconformity on the lot.
d.
The application to reconstruct the nonconforming building or structure shall be filed with the zoning administrator within six months of the event in which the building or structure was damaged or destroyed.
e.
The reconstruction of the building or structure shall not be detrimental to adjacent property and the surrounding neighborhood.
3.
If a nonconforming building or structure is moved for any reason and for any distance, it shall be moved to a location which complies with the requirements of this ordinance.
B.
None of the provisions of this section are meant to preclude normal repairs and maintenance on any nonconforming building or structure that would prevent strengthening or correcting any unsafe condition of the building or structure.
Sec. 24-5. - Unlawful nonconformities.
new
Any lot, use, building or structure established in violation of the provisions of this ordinance or any prior zoning ordinance or amendment shall not be considered a legal nonconformity and shall not be entitled to the provisions, remedies and safeguards of this article.
