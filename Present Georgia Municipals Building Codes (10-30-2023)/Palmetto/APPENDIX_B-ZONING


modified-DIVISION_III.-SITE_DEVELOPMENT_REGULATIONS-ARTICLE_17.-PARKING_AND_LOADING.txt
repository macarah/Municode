ARTICLE 17. - PARKING AND LOADING

Sec. 17-1. - Off-street parking requirements.
new
A.
Applicability of Parking Requirements. For all buildings and uses established after the effective date of this ordinance, off-street parking shall be provided as required by this article.
1.
Whenever use of a building or lot is changed to another classification of use, off-street parking facilities shall be provided, as required by this article.
2.
If the intensity of use of any building or lot is increased, through the addition of floor area, increase in seating capacity, number of employees or other means, additional off-street parking shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use, as required by this article.
3.
Off-street parking facilities in existence on the effective date of this ordinance shall not be reduced below the requirements of this article, nor shall nonconforming parking facilities that exist as of the effective date of this ordinance be further reduced or made more nonconforming.
4.
An area designated as required off-street parking shall not be changed to another use, unless equal facilities are provided elsewhere in accordance with the provisions of this article.
B.
Off-street parking facilities required for all uses other than single and two-family dwellings shall be located on the lot or within 300 feet of the building(s) or use they are intended to serve, as measured along lines of public access from the nearest point of the parking facility to the building(s) or use served. Off-street parking facilities required for single-and two-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot or plot of ground as the building they are intended to serve, and shall consist of a parking strip, parking apron, and/or garage. All residential driveways shall meet city engineering standards. In the C-2 District parking facilities shall be located within 600 feet of the building or use to be served.
C.
Shared/Common Parking.
1.
Two or more buildings or uses may use a common parking facility provided that the number of parking spaces provided is equal to the required number of spaces for all the uses computed separately. Cumulative parking requirements for mixed-use developments or shared facilities may be reduced by the planning and zoning board where it can be determined that one or more of the factors listed in subsection D. below apply.
2.
Parking facilities for a church or place of worship may be used to meet not more than 50 percent of the off-street parking for theaters, stadiums and other places of public assembly, stores, office buildings and industrial establishments lying within 500 feet of a church or place of worship, as measured along lines of public access, provided that the other uses are not normally operating between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Sundays and that the church or place of worship makes the spaces available.
D.
Modification of Parking Requirements. The reviewing authority may reduce the parking space requirements of this article for any use, based upon one or more of the following conditions:
1.
Shared parking by multiple uses where there will be a high proportion of multipurpose visits or uses having peak parking demands during differing times of the day or days of the week and meeting the following requirements:
a.
Pedestrian connections shall be maintained between the uses.
b.
For separate lots, shared parking shall be adjacent to each other, with pedestrian and vehicular connections maintained between the lots.
c.
Unless the multiple uses all are within a unified business center, office park or industrial park all under the same ownership, shared parking agreements shall be filed with the city clerk after approval by the zoning administrator.
2.
Convenient municipal off-street parking or on-street spaces are located adjacent to the subject property.
3.
Expectation of walk-in trade is reasonable due to sidewalk connections to adjacent residential neighborhoods or employment centers. To allow for a parking space reduction, the site design shall incorporate pedestrian connections to the site and on-site pedestrian circulation, providing safe and convenient access to the building entrance.
4.
Other forms of travel such as transit are available. In allowing a parking space reduction, the reviewing authority may require that the site design incorporate transit stops, pedestrian connections to nearby transit stops, or bicycle parking facilities.
5.
Where the applicant has provided a parking study, conducted by a qualified traffic engineer, demonstrating that another standard would be more appropriate based on actual number of employees, expected level of customer traffic, or actual counts at a similar establishment.
6.
The reviewing authority may require a parking study to document that any one or more of the criteria [of subsections] 1. through 4. above would be met.
E.
Deferred Parking.
1.
Where a reduction in the number of parking spaces is not warranted, but an applicant demonstrates that the parking requirements for a proposed use would be excessive, the city council may defer some of the required parking. The site plan shall designate portions of the site for future construction of the required parking spaces, meeting the design and dimensional requirements of this article. Any area so designated shall be maintained in a landscaped appearance and not occupy required greenbelts, or parking lot setbacks, or be used for any other purpose. Landscaping, such as parking lot trees, that would otherwise be required for the deferred spaces shall be installed within the deferred parking area.
2.
The deferred parking shall be required to meet ordinance requirements, if constructed. Construction of the additional parking spaces within the deferred parking area may be initiated by the owner or required by the city, based on parking needs or observation, and shall require administrative approval of an amended site plan.
F.
Required Off-Street Parking Spaces. The minimum number of required off-street parking spaces shall be provided and maintained on the premises or as otherwise allowed by this article, on the basis of the following schedule. As a condition of approval, the city council may require that a performance guarantee be posted, in accordance with the provisions of Section 21-5.
1.
When units or measurements determining the number of required parking spaces result in a fraction over one-half, a full parking space shall be required.
2.
In the case of a use not specifically mentioned, the requirement for off-street parking facilities for a specified use which is most similar, as determined by the zoning administrator, shall apply.
3.
Each 24 inches of bench, pew, or similar seating facilities shall be counted as one seat, except if specifications and plans filed with the building department specify a maximum seating capacity, that number may be used as the basis for required parking spaces.
4.
Unless otherwise indicated, floor area shall be usable floor area (UFA) as defined in Article 24.
5.
Where parking requirements are based upon maximum seating or occupancy capacity, the capacity shall be as determined by the building code and fire code.
6.
In order to minimize excessive areas of pavement that detract from aesthetics and contribute to high rates of storm water runoff, the minimum parking space requirements of this section shall not be exceeded by more than ten percent, unless approved by the planning and zoning board as part of site plan review. In approving additional parking space, the planning and zoning board shall determine that the parking is necessary, based on documented evidence, to accommodate the use on a typical day.
