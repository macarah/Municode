ARTICLE 18. - BUILDING DESIGN AND MATERIALS

Sec. 18-1. - Building appearance.
new
A.
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide exterior building wall material standards to enhance the visual environment of the city, thereby improving property values, stimulating investment in various business districts, encouraging quality industrial, and research and development projects, and enhancing the quality of life for city residents. The provisions of this section are to ensure that quality architecture is used to ensure that buildings retain their value, protect the investment of adjacent landowners, blend harmoniously into the streetscape, and create a positive image for business and employment districts.
B.
Applicability. This section shall apply to all new construction, except single-family detached and two-family residential structures, and shall consist of those materials and combinations of materials specified in this section. Architecture shall be reviewed by the zoning administrator or planning and zoning board, as applicable, as a part of site plan review under the requirements of Article 20.
C.
Building Materials. Minimum requirements for building materials are as follows. Calculations for material wall percentages do not include areas of the façade used for doors and windows.
1.
Residential. All multiple-family, townhouse, continuing care, retirement, nursing care and other residential buildings, except single family detached and two-family, located in any district shall meet the following elevation material requirements:

  D.
Allowance for Other Materials. The reviewing authority may waive or modify the material requirements of this section if it finds that a proposed building design and the materials or combinations of materials are in keeping with the purpose of this section. The reviewing authority shall also consider the desired character of the area, site visibility, proposed landscaping, building scale and design recommendations of the comprehensive plan. Acceptable substitute materials may include tilt-up panels, split-face block and similar high quality, durable and aesthetically compatible materials. However, metal siding, vinyl siding, and plain concrete block shall not be permitted.
E.
Design Standards. Buildings shall have architectural variety, but enhance the overall cohesive community character. At a minimum, the following standards shall be met:

F.
Site Elements. Signs and other site features shall be designed and located so they are aesthetically consistent and harmonious with the overall development. Sign bases shall be constructed of material which is compatible with the principal building. Mechanical equipment shall be screened in accordance with Section 18-3.
G.
Existing Buildings. The following shall apply to additions or remodeling of existing buildings or to accessory buildings on existing sites:
1.
Where a new wall material is proposed for an existing building wall, only that portion of the building being altered shall be subject to this section. However, in considering the proposed alteration, the reviewing authority may modify the material requirements of this section to ensure consistency with the architecture of the remainder building.
2.
Where an addition is proposed to an existing building, the reviewing authority may allow the use of existing or compatible wall materials for the addition; provided that the design of the alteration is consistent with the existing building wall design.

Purpose. The purpose of this section is to permit reasonable uses of outdoor lighting for night-time safety, utility, security, productivity, enjoyment, and commerce while minimizing the effects of excessive or uncontrolled light to:
1.
Maintain consistent and uniform light levels for traffic and pedestrian safety along roadways, sidewalks, and in parking lots.
2.
Ensure uniform lighting for security and law enforcement.
3.
Minimize glare, obtrusive light, and artificial sky glow by limiting outdoor lighting that is misdirected, excessive, or unnecessary.

Preserve the restful quality of nighttime by eliminating intrusive artificial light and lighting that unnecessarily contributes to "sky glow."
6.
Curtail and reverse the degradation of the nighttime environment and the night sky.
7.
Preserve the dark night sky for astronomy.
8.
Conserve energy and resources to the greatest extent possible.
B.

Along a property line adjoining a non-residential use or district 0.5 fc 3 fc 5
Along a property line adjoining a residential use or district 0 fc 0.1 fc
  1. Lighting levels may be reduced to one-half footcandle with a uniformity ratio of not more than ten to one after 12:00 p.m., or after established hours of operation.
2. The minimum illumination levels shall not apply to portions of the site that are fenced to restrict public access, such as storage yards.
3. For automobile dealerships and other types of outdoor sales areas the maximum illumination may be increased to 15 footcandles, provided the limits at the property line are not exceeded.
4. These regulations shall not apply to ornamental street lighting, public street lights, or driveway/intersection lighting necessary for pedestrian and traffic safety.
5. The light level along a non-residential property line may be increased to up to five footcandles where there is shared access/vehicular connection with the adjacent use or the adjacent use is a similar use (e.g. commercial adjacent to commercial)
C.
Light Fixtures. Outdoor lighting on all non-residential sites shall be directed downward and confined to the ground areas of lawns or parking lots except as noted elsewhere in this section. Lighting shall utilize full cutoff fixtures that are recessed sufficiently so the light source is not visible from off site. Bollard lights are permitted to light driveways and pedestrian areas. All lamps shall be metal halide, unless otherwise approved by the city.

Any site plan application for new or revised lighting shall include a photometric plan overlaid on the site plan illustrating the planned layout and footcandles of site lighting. The following are required for review:
1.
Lighting plan showing light pole and fixture locations and type designations;
2.
Photometric plan showing horizontal luminance levels in a point by point format with contour lines. Canopy lighting will also be included in luminance levels;
