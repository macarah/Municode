ARTICLE III. - AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER SYSTEMS

Sec. 9-41. - New buildings and/or structures.
All new buildings and/or structures, including but not limited to multifamily residential structures such as apartments, townhouses, condominiums, duplexes, and triplexes and one-family dwellings with side yard set backs of five (5) feet or less, shall be protected throughout by an approved supervised automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with the current State of Georgia adopted edition of N.F.P.A. 13, 13R, and 13D Standards for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems. A sprinkler control valve and water flow device shall be provided for each floor. This is not to restrict the fire marshal form requiring the installation of a water-based fire protection system and/or smoke detection system if, in the opinion of the fire official and for the public interest, the health and welfare of the firefighters, and the protection of human life, such a system would serve to benefit all parties that may be affected by the type of construction, hazard of content, limited access to the structure, and for other purposes. The kind of system shall be determined by the requirements of N.F.P.A. 13, 13R, and 13D, based on the type of construction and the tenants' ability to evacuate. Residential sprinklers shall be provided within dwelling units, apartments, and guest rooms.

(b)
Existing buildings, when required to have automatic sprinkler protection by subsection (a) above, shall be retrofitted for automatic sprinklers as required by the fire official in accordance with N.F.P.A. 13, 13R, and 13D, when the cost of renovation exceeds fifty (50) percent of the latest approved value of the building.
