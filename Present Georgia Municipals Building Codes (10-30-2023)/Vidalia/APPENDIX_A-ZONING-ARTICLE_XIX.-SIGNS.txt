DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 1900. - Findings, purpose and intent.
(a)
The City of Vidalia finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever-increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises.
(b)
Regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the city's citizens.
(c)
The city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The mayor and council finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, public utility signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power.
(d)
The city finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of providing addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Signs at the entrances to subdivisions or major developments favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this ordinance, the provisions of this Ordinance are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners. The city further finds that holiday decorations such as strings of light are not signs, but rather seasonal ornamentation not controlled by this Ordinance.
(e)
The purposes of this article are to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication within the city; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety; to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of this chapter.
(f)
In considering the appropriate level of sign regulation for the City of Vidalia, the mayor and council have considered planning studies, reports, news articles and related information from a variety of sources. The mayor and council have determined that high intensity full color LED signs pose unique and substantial hazards to traffic caused by a higher level of distractibility than monochrome LED signs. In addition, the high intensity full color LED signs are inconsistent with the aesthetic standards established for major thoroughfares running through the city.

Upon the filing of an application for a permit, the building inspector shall review all plans and specifications submitted and the premises upon which the sign is proposed to be erected. Such review shall be completed within thirty (30) business days of submission of a completed sign application. If, based on review of the permit application and inspection of the site, the proposed sign is in compliance with the requirements of this article and all other ordinances and laws of the city, the building inspector shall issue a permit upon payment of permit fees no later than thirty (30) business days from receipt of the completed application. If no decision is made within thirty (30) days, the permit will be deemed denied.
(g)
The city shall deny permits to applicants who submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this article, are incomplete, or contain any material false statements. Violation of any provision of this article will be grounds for terminating a permit granted by the city for the erection of a sign. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this article, the building inspector shall revoke the permit. Should the building inspector deny a permit, the reasons for denial shall be stated in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application on or before thirty (30) business days after the city received the completed application. Alternatively, the city may personally serve the sign applicant with a copy of the written notice of denial within thirty (30) business days after the city's receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, instead of the date of the original submission.
(h)
An individual whose permit application has been denied or a permittee whose permit has been revoked may appeal the decision to the board of appeals, provided such appellant files a written notice of appeal with the city manager within ten (10) business days of the building inspector's notice. Such appeal shall be considered by the board of appeals at the next meeting held after the city's receipt of the written notice of appeal, provided that such notice of appeal is received a minimum of seven (7) business days before the next meeting. Appeal notices received within seven (7) days of a scheduled board of appeals meeting shall be heard at the next meeting more than seven (7) days following receipt of appeal. The board of appeals shall issue a written decision to the applicant no later than thirty (30) days following the close of the appeal hearing. If no decision is made within thirty (30) days, the appeal will be deemed denied. Decisions of the board of appeals to affirm the decision of the building inspector or to overrule the decision of the building inspector and grant or continue the permit for which appeal is taken shall be reduced to writing and served upon the applicant in the same manner as the original notice to deny or notice of revocation.
(i)
In the event an applicant whose permit has been denied or a permit holder whose permit has been revoked is dissatisfied with the decision of the board of appeals, such applicant or permit holder may petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court as provided by law.
(j)
