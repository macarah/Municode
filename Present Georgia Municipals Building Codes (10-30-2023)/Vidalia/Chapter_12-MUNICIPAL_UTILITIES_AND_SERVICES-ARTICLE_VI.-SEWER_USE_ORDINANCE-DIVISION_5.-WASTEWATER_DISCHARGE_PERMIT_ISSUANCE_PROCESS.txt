DIVISION 5. - WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT ISSUANCE PROCESS

Sec. 12-181. - Wastewater discharge permit duration.
Wastewater discharge permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five (5) years from the effective date of the permit. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued for a period less than five (5) years, at the discretion of the control authority. Each wastewater discharge permit will indicate a specific date upon which it will expire.
Sec. 12-182. - Wastewater discharge permit contents.
Wastewater discharge permits shall include such conditions deemed reasonably necessary by the control authority to prevent pass through or interference, protect the quality of the water body receiving the treatment plant's effluent, protect worker health and safety, protect the public, facilitate sludge management and disposal, and protect against damage to the POTW.
(1)
Wastewater discharge permits must contain:
a.
A statement that indicates wastewater discharge permit duration, which in no event shall exceed five (5) years;
b.
A statement that the wastewater discharge permit is nontransferable;
c.
Effluent limits based on applicable pretreatment standards;
d.
Self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification, and record-keeping requirements. These requirements shall include an identification of pollutants to be monitored, sampling location, sampling frequency, and sample type based on federal, state, and local law; and
e.
A statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and requirements and any applicable compliance schedule. Such schedule may not extend the time for compliance beyond that required by applicable federal, state, or local law.
(2)
Wastewater discharge permits may contain, but need not be limited to, the following conditions:
a.
Limits on the average and/or maximum rate of discharge, time of discharge, and/or requirements for flow regulation and equalization;
b.
Requirements for the installation and maintenance of pretreatment technology, pollution control, or construction of appropriate containment devices, designed to reduce, eliminate, or prevent the introduction of pollutants into the treatment works;
c.
Requirements for the development and implementation of accidental discharge/slug control plans or other special conditions including management practices necessary to adequately prevent accidental, unanticipated, or non-routine discharges;
d.
Development and implementation of waste minimization plans to reduce the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW;
e.
Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and sampling facilities and equipment;
f.
A statement that compliance with the wastewater discharge permit does not relieve the permittee of responsibility for compliance with all applicable federal and State pretreatment standards, including those which become effective during the term of the wastewater discharge permit; and
g.
Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the control authority to ensure compliance with this article, and federal and state laws, rules, and regulations.
Sec. 12-183. - Wastewater discharge permit appeals.
The control authority shall provide public notice of the issuance of a wastewater discharge permit. Any person, including the user, may petition the control authority to reconsider the terms of a wastewater discharge permit within thirty (30) days of notice of issuance of the discharge permit.
(1)
Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.
(2)
In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater discharge permit.
(3)
The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal.
(4)
If the control authority fails to act within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request, the request for reconsideration shall be deemed as denied. Decisions not to reconsider a wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater discharge permit, or not to modify a wastewater discharge permit, shall be considered final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.
