Sec. 10-34. - Hours of operation.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, establishments, public and private clubs, conducting business and operating for the purposes of providing entertainment to the general public in the form of providing the venue and services for disc jockey, dancing, singing, serving of beverages or food, any form of listening to or providing music and/or games of any type, to the end that many types of criminal activities and loud noises which create a nuisance frequently engendered by such business will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot defacto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protective form of expression would vanish. As to these establishments, this section represents a balancing of competing interest; reduce criminal activity and reduce loud and offensive noises which create nuisances and protection of neighborhoods through regulation of such establishments versus the protected rights of the establishments and patrons.
(b)
Hours of operation. Hours of operation for such licensed businesses and clubs shall be from 8:00 a.m. until 2:00 a.m. Monday through Saturday. Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this section, all businesses or clubs must close on Sunday by 12:00 a.m. and vacate the premises no later than 12:30 a.m., on Thanksgiving Day between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. and closed on Christmas Day.
(c)
Revocation. Failure to comply with the terms and provisions of this section or any violation may result in the suspension and/or revocation of license, if applicable, or the privilege of operation after notice and opportunity for a hearing.
