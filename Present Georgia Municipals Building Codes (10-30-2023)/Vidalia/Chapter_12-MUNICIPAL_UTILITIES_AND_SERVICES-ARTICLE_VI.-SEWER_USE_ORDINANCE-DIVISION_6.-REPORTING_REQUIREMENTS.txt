DIVISION 6. - REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 12-201. - Baseline monitoring reports.
(a)
Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraph (b), below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraph (b), below. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
(b)
Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
(1)
Identifying information. The name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owner.
(2)
Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility.
(3)
Description of operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.
(4)
Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(5)
Measurement of pollutants.
a.
The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process.
b.
The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long term average concentrations (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in section 12-210 of this article.
c.
Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in section 12-211 of this article.
(6)
Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized signatory and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment, is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
(7)
Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in section 12-202 of this article.
(8)
Signature and certification. All baseline-monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 12-166 of this article.
Sec. 12-202. - Compliance schedule progress report.
The following conditions shall apply to any schedule required by this article or the control authority:
(1)
The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, beginning and conducting routine operation);
(2)
No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
(3)
The user shall submit a progress report to the control authority no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
(4)
In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the control authority.
(5)
No compliance schedule shall exceed eighteen (18) months.
Sec. 12-203. - Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the control authority a report containing the information described in section 12-201(b)(4)—(6) of this article. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 12-166 of this article.
Sec. 12-204. - Periodic compliance reports.
(a)
All significant industrial user(s) shall, at a frequency determined by the control authority but in no case less than every six (6) months, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 12-166 of this article.
(b)
All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(c)
If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the control authority, using the procedures prescribed in sections 12-210 and 12-211 of this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
Sec. 12-205. - Report of changed conditions.
Each user must notify the control authority of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change.
(1)
The control authority may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 12-165 of this article.
(2)
The control authority may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 12-167 of this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 12-184 of this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(3)
No user shall implement the planned changed conditions(s) until and unless the control authority has responded to the user's notice.
(4)
For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow changes of twenty (20) percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. All users shall promptly notify the control authority in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including significant manufacturing process changes, pretreatment modifications, and the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p).
Sec. 12-206. - Reports of potential problems.
(a)
In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in section 12-121 of this article), the user shall immediately telephone and notify the control authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
(b)
Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the control authority, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article.
(c)
Failure to notify the control authority of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a violation of this article.
(d)
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (a), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
Sec. 12-207. - Reports from unpermitted users.
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports as may be required by the control authority.
Sec. 12-208. - Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting.
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the control authority as soon as possible but no later than twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also immediately repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within the time period specified by the control authority but at no time greater than thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The user may not be required to resample if the control authority monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the control authority samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling.
Sec. 12-209. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(a)
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the control authority, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities (in writing) of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under section 12-205 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 12-201, 12-203, and 12-204 of this article.
(b)
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(c)
In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the control authority, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
(d)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(e)
This reporting provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
Sec. 12-210. - Analytical requirements.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
Sec. 12-211. - Sample collection.
(a)
Except as indicated in subsection (b) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportioned composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the control authority may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(b)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
Sec. 12-212. - Timing.
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date post-marked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
Sec. 12-213. - Record keeping.
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records or information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the control authority, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the U.S. EPA, state, or control authority.
