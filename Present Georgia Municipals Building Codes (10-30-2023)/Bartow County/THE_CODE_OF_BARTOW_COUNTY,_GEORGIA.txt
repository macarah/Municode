PREFACE
This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of Bartow County, Georgia.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the county commissioner. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CODE APPENDIX CDA:1
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1
CODE INDEX CDi:1
  Indexes
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President of Municipal Code Corporation, and Kelly Cribbs, supplement editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to county staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

ORDINANCE READOPTING THE CODE OF BARTOW COUNTY, GEORGIA
AN ORDINANCE OF THE COUNTY COMMISSIONER OF BARTOW COUNTY SITTING FOR COUNTY PURPOSES FOR THE PURPOSE OF READOPTING THE CODE OF BARTOW COUNTY, GEORGIA; ADOPTING CHAPTER 1, GENERAL PROVISIONS; ADOPTING CHAPTER 2, ADMINISTRATION; ADOPTING CHAPTER 22, COURTS; MAKING TYPOGRAPHICAL CORRECTIONS; REPEALING UNADOPTED PROVISIONS; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES AT THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BARTOW COUNTY HELD ON DECEMBER 3, 2008
WHEREAS, O.C.G.A. § 36-80-19 requires all local governing authorities to provide for the general codification of all the ordinances and resolutions of that unit of local government having the force and effect of law; and
WHEREAS, in compliance with O.C.G.A. § 36-80-19, Bartow County adopted the Code of Bartow County, as complied by the Municipal Code Corporation on December 3, 2003; and
WHEREAS, the Code of Bartow County adopted in 2003 contained various errors, including ordinances not previously adopted by Bartow County, which were unknowingly inserted by Municipal Code Corporation in the Code of Ordinance, but were not intended to be part of the County's Code; and the ordinances and resolutions of Bartow County further having been substantially amended and revised in the intervening time; and
WHEREAS, the Code of Bartow County having been corrected to remove any ordinance not adopted by Bartow County, and by having inserted such amendments and revisions that have been made between 2003 and 2007, and the aforesaid changes having been submitted to Municipal Code Corporation for inclusion in the Code;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED AND IT HEREBY IS ORDAINED, by virtue of the authority vested in the Commissioner by law, and pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-80-19, that the Code of Bartow County, Georgia, consisting of Chapters 1 to 74 and Appendices A and B, as published by Municipal Code Corporation, and as incorporated herein by reference, is adopted as the codification of Bartow County's existing ordinances. Other than the provisions of Chapter 1 "General Provisions"; Chapter 2 "Administration"; Chapter 22, "Courts"; and any typographical corrections, which are new provisions and which are intended to be adopted as official ordinances of Bartow County by this ordinance, any additions contained in the Code of Bartow County, Georgia adopted hereby that do not have an antecedent ordinance duly adopted by Bartow County, Georgia are not intended to be a part of the County's Code and shall be of no force or effect. The intention of the Commissioner of Bartow County is that, other than the foregoing specifically mentioned provisions, only those ordinances duly and lawfully adopted and amended throughout the years by the governing authority shall be included in the Code.
IT IS FURTHER ORDAINED that the prior codification of the Code of Bartow County is repealed and replaced with this codification. This action does not repeal any ordinances contained in the prior codification except any ordinances or provisions that had no antecedent Bartow County ordinance and thus were never lawfully adopted by Bartow County. Said provisions have been deleted from the Code of Bartow County as adopted herein. Furthermore, the newly revised Code of Bartow County contains updated versions of existing ordinances, which were amended and revised by prior action of the Commissioner.
IT IS FURTHER ORDAINED that the adoption of this Code of Ordinances is not intended to readopt the existing Bartow County ordinances contained herein, but rather to readopt the corrected and updated republication and codification of existing ordinances for convenience of the public and to comply with the laws of Georgia requiring codification. This action specifically is not intended to readopt the Bartow County Zoning Ordinance or other ordinances requiring special notice and adoption procedures.
SO ADOPTED this 3rd day of December, 2008.
