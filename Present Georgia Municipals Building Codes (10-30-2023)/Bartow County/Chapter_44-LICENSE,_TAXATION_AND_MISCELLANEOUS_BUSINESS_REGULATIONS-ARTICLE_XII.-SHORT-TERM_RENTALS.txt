ARTICLE XII. - SHORT-TERM RENTALS

Sec. 44-710. - Purpose.
(a)
The purpose of this article is to establish standards for short-term rentals of privately-owned residential structures and homes which are rented to transient occupants, to minimize adverse effects of short-term rental uses on surrounding residential neighborhoods, and to preserve the character of neighborhoods. This article is intended to apply to those persons renting their property to others through websites such as www.vrbo.com, www.airbnb.com, and www.hometogo.com, and similar programs. This article is intended to provide opportunities for property owners to participate in short-term rental programs and generate income, while not unduly burdening adjacent properties, endangering life safety or violating applicable laws.
(b)
This article is not intended to regulate hotels, motels, inns, or non-short-term rental arrangements including, but not limited to, boardinghouses, lodging houses, or rooming houses, or an individual providing long-term rental (over 30 days) of their home. Hotels and extended stay hotels are subject to other articles in this chapter of the Code of Bartow County.
