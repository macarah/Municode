Sec. 74-521. - Low pressure sewer systems.
Low pressure sewer systems (LPSS) convey wastewater from a home or other structure to the county sewer system using small pump stations with grinders located at each house. LPSS can be installed when gravity sewers are not cost effective or feasible. LPSS can only be used to tie into the county sewer system if approved by the water department and if designed and installed according to county specifications. In addition, the county will take ownership and maintenance responsibly for the grinder pumps and a monthly maintenance charge will be added to the bills of customers served by LPSS.
