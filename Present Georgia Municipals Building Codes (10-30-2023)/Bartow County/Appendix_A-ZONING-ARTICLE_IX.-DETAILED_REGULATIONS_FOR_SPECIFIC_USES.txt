Sec. 9.4. - Landfills and solid waste disposal facilities.
9.4.1 Permitted landfills/disposal facilities are classified into three types:
1)
inert waste landfills;
2)
construction and demolition (C & D) landfills; and
3)
municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills.
Each type of landfill is defined below. Inert waste landfills are permitted as of right in the M-1 district, and permitted as conditional uses in the A-1, I-1 and I-2 districts. C&D and MSW landfills are only permitted as conditional uses in the I-2 district. Landfills that are not permitted in any district include hazardous waste landfills. In the event a solid waste disposal facility is sought to be constructed that is not covered specifically herein, the Zoning Administrator shall make a determination as to what use it is most closely related to and apply the relevant regulations. This Section incorporates by reference the definitions contained in O.C.G.A. ยง 12-8-22 and DNR Rule 391-3-4-.01.
Types of Disposal Facilities:
(A)
Inert waste landfill means a disposal facility accepting only wastes that will not or are not likely to cause production of leachate of environmental concern. Such wastes are limited to earth and earth-like products, concrete, cured asphalt, rocks, bricks, yard trimmings, stumps, limbs, and leaves. This definition excludes industrial and demolition waste not specifically listed above.
(B)
Construction/demolition waste landfill means a disposal facility accepting only waste building materials and rubble resulting from construction, remodeling, repair, and demolition operations on pavements, houses, commercial buildings and other structures. Such waste include, but are not limited to, wood, bricks, metal, concrete, wall board, paper, cardboard, inert waste landfill material, and other nonputrescible wastes which have a low potential for groundwater contamination.
(C)
Municipal solid waste landfill means any facility or location where the final deposition of any amount of municipal solid waste occurs, whether or not mixed with or including commercial or industrial solid waste, and includes, but is not limited to, municipal solid waste landfills and municipal solid waste thermal treatment technology facilities. "Municipal solid waste" means any solid waste derived from households, including garbage, trash, and sanitary waste in septic tanks and means solid waste from single-family and multifamily residences, hotels and motels, bunkhouses, campgrounds, picnic grounds, and day use recreation areas. The term includes yard trimmings, construction or demolition waste, and commercial solid waste but does not include solid waste from mining, agricultural, or silvicultural operations or industrial processes or operations.
(D)
Hazardous waste disposal facility. Hazardous waste landfills are prohibited, and hazardous waste (which means any solid waste which has been defined as hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the Board of Natural Resources, Chapter 391-3-11.) may not be disposed of in inert, construction/demolition, or solid waste landfills.

The boundary of the landfill property (either inside or outside the vegetated buffer) must be surrounded by a wooden privacy fence, at least eight (8) feet high.
(C)
All C & D and MSW landfills must be surrounded by a buffer at least one thousand (1,000) feet thick, located on the landfill property.
