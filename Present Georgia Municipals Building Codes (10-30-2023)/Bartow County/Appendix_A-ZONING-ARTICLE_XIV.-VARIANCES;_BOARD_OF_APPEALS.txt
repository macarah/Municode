ARTICLE XIV. - VARIANCES; BOARD OF APPEALS

Sec. 14.1. - Administrative variances.
If in the judgment of the Zoning Administrator, the application of any particular numeric criteria, standard or requirement of this Ordinance causes undue hardship on the applicant, the Zoning Administrator shall be empowered to grant an administrative variance to alter said requirement by up to twenty (20) percent, if in doing so, the purposes of the ordinance are not impaired, and there is not a negative impact on the surrounding uses, properties, or neighbors. In granting an administrative variance, the Zoning Administrator may attach such conditions as the Zoning Administrator may deem advisable so that the purpose of this Ordinance will be served, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. The Zoning Administrator shall not be authorized to grant a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited. An administrative variance shall be granted or denied in writing. Notice of the grant of an administrative variance shall be sent to all adjoining property owners via first class mail by the applicant. The notice shall describe the variance granted and state that interested parties have 15 days in which to file an appeal of the variance. Only owners reflected on the records of the tax assessors as of the date of the application shall be entitled to notice. Proof of mailing, as described in Sec. 14.5.3, shall be submitted to the Zoning Department within 10 days of grant of the variance. The thirty days shall be counted from the date of mailing of the notice. The purpose of the administrative variance is to address particular hardship situations of individual lots and parcels. The purpose is not to grant a wholesale reduction for an entire subdivision. For any residential subdivision or development, no more than ten percent (10%) of the units can receive the same administrative variance. For example, for a 150 lot R-8 subdivision, the front yard setback of no more than 15 lots can be reduced below 20 feet. Similarly in non-residential development, the administrative variance should be applied only when necessary for a hardship situation such as topography concerns.

Sec. 14.3. - Proceedings of the board of appeals.

(Ord. of 7-21-2021(4) )
Sec. 14.4. - Powers and duties of the board of appeals.
The Board of Appeals shall have the following powers and duties:
14.4.1 Appeals. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this Ordinance. Appeals to the Board of Appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of Bartow County affected by any decision of the Zoning Administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) days of said decision by filing with the Zoning Administrator a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. Decisions on appeals shall be issued in writing within ten days of the appeal.
14.4.2 Variances. The Board of Appeals has the power to hear requests for variances from the provisions of this Ordinance. Variance may be granted only if the Board finds all of the following to exist:
(A)
That one of the following is true, through no action or fault of the property owner or predecessor:
(i)
the property is exceptionally narrow, shallow or unusually shaped,
(ii)
the property contains exceptional topographic conditions,
(iii)
the property contains other extraordinary or exceptional conditions, or
(iv)
there are existing other extraordinary or exceptional circumstances; and
(B)
That the strict application of the requirements of this Ordinance would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon, the owner of this property; and
(C)
That the requested variance relief may be granted without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this Ordinance.
Variance decisions shall be issued in writing within ten days of the hearing.
14.4.3 Conditions. In granting a variance, the Board of Appeals may attach such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable so that the purpose of this Ordinance will be served, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done.
14.4.4 Limitations on variances; improper variance requests. Variances cannot be given to totally remove a requirement or to exempt a property or applicant entirely from a requirement. If a variance is being sought that is, in the judgment of the Zoning Administrator, a request that would constitute a text amendment, then the application shall not be accepted. For example, a request to be exempted from the Etowah Valley Historic District requirements would not be the subject of a variance. The applicant shall instead be directed to file for a text amendment. Variances can only be given to alter a numeric value, such as a setback, height limit, area limit, and so forth. Furthermore, the Board of Appeals shall not be authorized to grant a density variance or a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance seeks something that cannot be varied, or to eliminate rather than modify a requirement or regulation. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance is contradictory to the ordinance (such as reducing a requirement to zero or totally eliminating a requirement). A variance shall not be granted to increase the maximum area of signs as permitted in a zoning district, nor the maximum number of signs. A variance shall not be granted to approve a billboard nor to convert an existing sign to electronic signage. A variance shall not be granted to reduce the C-1 zoning district design standards for new construction.
14.4.5 Self-inflicted hardship. The Board shall not grant variances when the hardship was created by the property owner or his predecessor, and shall not grant hardship variances based on shape or topography for lots of record not existing prior to February 21, 1996. Configuring a subdivision to create lots that are difficult to build is an example of a hardship created by the property owner or processor, that do not justify a variance.
14.4.6 Place of worship. In compliance with Federal law, if the variance is requested by a place of worship or church, in connection with the exercise of religion, the Board shall additionally consider whether the regulation imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion, whether the regulation serves a compelling governmental interest, whether the denial is the least restrictive means to serve that interest, or whether the variance can be granted without harming that interest.
14.4.7 Group homes. If the variance is related to a Group Home for Persons with a Disability, the Board shall additionally consider what reasonable accommodations in this Ordinance can be made to provide persons with a disability equal opportunities to use and enjoy dwellings, while not abrogating the purposes of this Ordinance. Any reasonable accommodation should only relate to the disability.
