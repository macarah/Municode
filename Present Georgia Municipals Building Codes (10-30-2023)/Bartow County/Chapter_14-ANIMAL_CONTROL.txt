(e)
Accumulation of waste matter. It shall be unlawful for any owner or custodian of any animal to permit the accumulation of waste matter from animals to collect and remain on the property of the owner or custodian, or on the property of others so as to cause or create an unhealthy, unsanitary, dangerous or offensive living condition on the owner's or custodian's property, or to abutting property of others. It shall be unlawful to allow animal waste matter to run off into any river, stream, lake, pond or other watercourse in Bartow County, or to run off onto any other person's property.
(f)
Failure to provide adequate shelter. It shall be unlawful for any owner or custodian of any animal to fail to provide adequate shelter from the elements for that animal, as appropriate to the species. Providing adequate shelter requires providing sufficient food and water, disposing of waste, providing sufficient temperature control (whether heat, ventilation, or cooling) to prevent suffering by the animal, and not maintaining conditions conducive to disease and infection. In respect to dogs, adequate shelter means at least a dog house or shelter meeting the requirements of subsection 14-19(b). For example, tethering a dog outside during summer without shade or water would be a violation of this section, as well as potentially subsections 14-41(a) and (b).
(g)
Unsanitary, dangerous or offensive conditions. It shall be unlawful for any owner or custodian of any animal to permit or cause unsanitary, dangerous or offensive conditions by virtue of the size or number of animals maintained at a single location or due to the inadequacy of the facilities.

Dead animals that are buried must be buried at least three feet below the ground level, have not less than three feet of earth over the carcass, and must not contaminate ground water or surface water.
(j)
Separate violation per animal. Each animal kept in violation of this section shall count as a separate violation.
(Ord. of 7-11-2012, Att.)
Sec. 14-42. - Sick, injured, or contagious animals.
(a)
Impoundment of sick or injured animals. In any situation deemed appropriate by the animal control officer involving a sick or injured animal whose owner cannot be located and the condition of such animal is such that death or great suffering to the animal is likely, the animal control officer may take custody of such animal and may secure veterinary services for such animal. The owner of such animal shall be responsible for reimbursement of all expenses related to treatment and boarding of the animal.
(b)
Destruction of sick or injured animals. Any sick or injured animal, deemed by a licensed veterinarian to be suffering to such an extent that the humane destruction of the animal is appropriate and the owner of the animal cannot be located, shall be humanely destroyed by the veterinarian in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1.
(c)
Infected or contagious animals. Any animal impounded by the animal control officer that is, in the opinion of a licensed veterinarian, infected with a disease likely to cause death or great suffering to the animal, or which is a contagious disease, or which will likely spread to other animals, shall be isolated and the owner of such animal shall be notified.

(d)
Reimbursement. The owner of the animal shall be responsible for reimbursement to the county for all expenses involving the boarding, treatment and destruction of any such animal.

Notification of bites. It shall be the duty of any person bitten by a wild or domestic animal to immediately notify the Bartow County Health Department and the Bartow County Animal Control Department. It shall be the duty of the owner, custodian, or any person having possession and knowledge of any animal which has bitten any person or animal, or of any animal which exhibits any signs of rabies, to notify the animal control department and the Bartow County Health Department and to confine such animal in accordance with this chapter.
(f)
Impoundment and quarantine. The animal control officer shall be authorized to impound and quarantine dogs that have been bitten by wild animals or bitten by dogs or cats that do not have current records of vaccination against rabies. Management of animals exposed to rabies shall be according to the procedures set forth in the Georgia Rabies Control Manual, latest edition, which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully herein. The protocols for livestock, dogs, cats and ferrets possibly exposed to rabies, as well as the protocols for animal to animal exposure and human exposure shall be enforced as set forth in the Georgia Rabies Control Manual, latest edition. The animal control officer shall be authorized to take any and all steps set forth in said manual up to and including euthanizing and testing of animals.
(g)
Animals impounded for rabies quarantine. Animals impounded for rabies quarantine shall be isolated pursuant to the procedures of the Georgia Rabies Control Manual, latest edition. If the animal shows signs of rabies or dies during confinement, it will be sent off for testing. If the animal survives and does not show signs of rabies, it will be returned to the owner upon payment of fees.
(h)
Quarantine/isolation procedures. In certain circumstances, the animal control officer may allow the animal owner to quarantine the animal that has been bitten in lieu of the animal being euthanized and tested. The quarantine period varies depending on the circumstance, as set forth in the Georgia Rabies Control Manual, latest edition. In that case, the animal must be placed in a secure enclosure where no other animal or person can be exposed to the virus which can be transmitted into bite wounds, open cuts in skin, and onto mucous membranes. The animal must be kept in a secure enclosure approved by the animal control department and when deemed necessary may require two layers of fencing, separated by at least one foot. Food must be pushed in from a distance, and the animal cannot be approached by any person. Other protocols for quarantine shall be provided by the animal control officer and the Bartow County Health Department. If the animal escapes from the enclosure, it will be impounded and euthanized for testing.
(Ord. of 7-11-2012, Att.)
Sec. 14-43. - Cruelty to animals.
(a)
Cruelty to animals. It shall be unlawful for any person to willfully or maliciously strike, beat, abuse, intentionally run down with a vehicle, or cause or inflict unnecessary pain, injury, suffering or death to an animal through any act, omission or willful neglect, except that reasonable force may be used to defend his or her own person or property, or the person or property of another, from injury or damage being caused by a dog; or kill any dog causing injury or damage to any livestock, poultry, or pet animal as authorized by Georgia law, O.C.G.A. § 4-8-5. "Willful neglect" means the intentional withholding of food and water required by an animal to prevent starvation or dehydration.
(b)
Poisoning. No person, except a licensed veterinarian for humanitarian purposes, shall intentionally administer poison to any animal or knowingly leave any poisonous substance of any kind or ground glass in any place with the intent to injure any animal. This provision is not applicable to licensed exterminators using poisons as part of a pest control program or the use of commercial insecticides and rodent baits used to control insects and wild rodents.
(c)
Investigation. The animal control officer shall investigate complaints pertaining to cruelty to animals. The animal control officer may request the assistance of the sheriff's department or the appropriate law enforcement officers of a participating municipality.
(d)
Necessary pain. In the case of activities where physical pain is necessarily caused, such as medical and scientific research, food processing, customary and normal veterinary and agricultural husbandry practices, pest elimination, and animal training and hunting, failure to employ the most humane method reasonably available shall constitute cruelty to animals and shall be unlawful.
(Ord. of 7-11-2012, Att.)
Sec. 14-44. - Community cat programs.
(a)
Purpose. Research and experience have shown that achieving a "no-kill" status as a community requires a variety of strategies, and that community cats pose unique challenges. Community cat populations can be reduced by an effective TNR program, calling for cats to be trapped, sterilized, vaccinated and returned to the original outside home. Over time, such programs have been shown to reduce the population of feral cats.
(b)
The county seeks to cooperate with non-profit organizations and community cat caregivers to facility community cat programs and TNR programs. To that end, the following listed sections of chapter 14 contain provisions that cannot logically apply to community cats or community cat caregivers:
(1)
Section 14-14 regarding control of animals shall not apply to community cats.
(2)
Community cats that have been though a TNR program shall not be considered public nuisance animals under section 14-16 simply by virtue of being a community cat.
(3)
Maximum cat number restrictions of section 14-17 shall not apply to community cats with no known owner. Persons may not violate cat number restrictions from section 14-17 on their own property by claiming they maintain a community cat colony.
(4)
Section 14-41(c), (d) and (f) shall not apply to community cats that are part of a trap-neuter-vaccinate-return program or a shelter-neuter-vaccinate-return program or the respective community cat caregivers.
(5)
Community cats shall not be subject to impoundment under section 14-82 solely by virtue of being a community cat.
(6)
Nothing in the foregoing is meant to imply that community cats cannot be impounded or be deemed public nuisances by virtue of, for example, becoming diseased, attacking and injuring persons or domestic pets, creating a neighborhood nuisance, etc.

Sec. 14-66. - Dog classification.
(a)
Classification levels. "Classified dog" means any dog that has been classified as either a dangerous or vicious dog pursuant to this article. Classifications are as follows:
(1)
Dangerous dog. Any dog that:
a.
Causes a substantial puncture of a person's skin by teeth without causing serious injury (see section 14-13); provided, however, that a nip, scratch, or abrasion shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subparagraph;
b.
Aggressively attacks in a manner that causes a person to reasonably believe that the dog posed an imminent threat of serious injury (see section 14-13) to such a person or another person although no such injury occurs; provided, however, that the acts of barking, growling, or showing of teeth by a dog shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subparagraph; or
c.
While off the owner's property, kills a pet animal; provided, however, that this subparagraph shall not apply where the death of such pet animal is caused by a dog that is working or training as a hunting dog, herding dog, or predator control dog.
(2)
Vicious dog. Any dog that inflicts a serious injury on a person or causes serious injury (see section 14-13) to a person resulting from reasonable attempts to escape the dog's attack.
(3)
Euthanasia for causing serious injury on more than one occasion. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-26, a dog that is found, after notice and opportunity for hearing as provided below, to have caused a serious injury to a human on more than one occasion shall be euthanized; provided, however, that no injury occurring before July 1, 2012, shall count for purposes of this subsection.
(4)
Judge authorized to order euthanasia. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-25, the judge of any superior court of competent jurisdiction within this state may order the euthanasia of a dog if the court finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing as provided by this section, that the dog has seriously injured a human or presents a danger to humans not suitable for control under this article and:
a.
The owner or custodian of the dog has been convicted of a violation of any state criminal law and the crime was related to such dog; or
b.
Any local governmental authority has filed with the court a civil action requesting the euthanasia of the dog.
(5)
Previously classified animals. Any dog classified prior to July 1, 2012, as a potentially dangerous dog in this state shall on and after that date be classified as a dangerous dog. Any dog classified prior to July 1, 2012, as a dangerous dog or vicious dog in this state shall on and after that date be classified as a vicious dog under this chapter. The owner of any dog classified prior to July 1, 2012, shall come into compliance with all current provisions of this chapter by January 1, 2013.
(b)
Confiscation. If an animal control officer has reason to believe that a dog has acted in a manner that justifies a classification as a dangerous dog or a vicious dog, the dog may be confiscated, impounded, classified, and notice provided as set forth below. A law enforcement officer or animal control officer shall immediately impound a dog if the officer believes the dog poses a threat to the public safety.
(c)
Exceptions. An animal shall not be classified within the meaning of this section if it inflicts injury upon a person when the animal is being used by a law enforcement officer or military officer to carry out the law enforcement or military officer's official duties. No dog shall be classified as a dangerous or vicious dog if the person injured by such dog was a person who, at the time, was: 1) committing a trespass; 2) was abusing the dog; or 3) was committing or attempting to commit an offense under [O.C.G.A.] Chapter 5 of Title 16.
(d)
Classification by animal control. The animal control officer shall make a determination whether the dog shall be classified as a dangerous dog or vicious dog.

(6)
The notice shall include a form to request a hearing and shall provide specific instructions on mailing or delivering such request to animal control.
(f)
Response to notice. If no owner comes forward in response to the notice provided in paragraph (e), the animal shall be kept for five days, and then may be disposed of by animal control, including by humane destruction in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. If the owner comes forward and no appeal hearing is requested, the animal may be returned to the owner provided the owner complies with the requirements of this division, including payment of fees set forth in paragraph (j) and the requirements of section 14-67. If a hearing is requested, the provisions of paragraph (g) shall apply.
(g)
Appeal hearing. When the animal control board receives a proper and timely request for an appeal hearing of a classification, it shall schedule such hearing within 30 days after receiving the request; however, such hearing may be continued by the authority for good cause shown. The board shall notify the dog owner in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery of the date, time, and place of the hearing, and such notice shall be mailed to the dog owner at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. At the hearing, the owner of the dog shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence, and in addition thereto, the governing authority or board shall receive such other evidence and hear such other testimony as the governing authority or board may find reasonably necessary to make a determination either to sustain, modify, or overrule the animal control officer's classification of the dog, including the power to impose conditions on continued possession of the dog.
(h)
Decision. After hearing the evidence, the animal control board shall be empowered to take the following actions:
(1)
Sustain the animal control officer's classification;
(2)
Modify the animal control officer's classification;
(3)
Overrule the animal control officer's classification;
(4)
Impose conditions or restrictions in addition to the required conditions set forth in this chapter for keeping a classified dog; or
(5)
Order that the dog be euthanized pursuant to subsection 14-66(a)(3) if the requirements are met.
(i)
Notice of decision. The decision shall be made at the hearing, and within ten days after the date of the hearing, the animal control board shall notify the dog owner in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery of its determination on the matter. If such determination is that the dog is a dangerous dog or vicious dog, the notice shall specify the date upon which that determination is effective. Any specific additional conditions or restrictions shall be set forth in the notice. If the determination is that the dog is to be euthanized pursuant to subsection 14-66(a)(3), the notice shall specify the date by which the euthanasia shall occur.
(j)
Return to owner. In the event the dog is classified as dangerous or vicious dog, (and the dog is not ordered euthanized), the animal shall not be returned to the owner until payment of reasonable confiscation costs, including an impoundment fee of $100.00, boarding costs of $15.00 per day, and all actual veterinary care costs. In the event the owner has not complied with the provisions of this paragraph and also satisfied the requirements set forth in section 14-67 within ten days of the date the dog was classified, said dog shall be destroyed in an expeditious and humane manner in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1; provided, however, upon a showing for good cause, the director of animal control may extend said time, up to an additional 15 days, upon the payment by the owner of the per diem boarding costs for said dog. In the event the dog is ordered euthanized, the animal shall be humanely destroyed any time after five business days after the date of the decision of the animal control board in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1.
(k)
Judicial review. Judicial review of the animal control board's final decision may be had in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 50-13-19, except that venue shall be limited to the Bartow County Superior Court. The filing of the petition for judicial review in superior court does not itself stay enforcement of the board's decision. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the animal control director may grant, or the reviewing court may order, a stay upon appropriate terms for good cause shown.
