1.
Tree Planting.
a.
Street Frontage Planting Requirements. A tree planting strip, exclusive of access driveways, with an average width of ten (10) feet is required along all property lines abutting the public right-of-way. If large maturing trees are used, the planting strip shall include two (2) trees with a minimum of two (2) inches of caliper and eight (8) feet in height in the first forty (40) feet and one (1) tree per forty (40) feet thereafter or fraction thereof. If small maturing trees are used, the same conditions apply; but the increment drops to thirty (30) feet.
When a building permit is requested for renovation of a previously developed site and where the required frontage planting strip does not exist, trees are still required. However, in lieu of an ten foot wide planting strip, a pavement cutout of a minimum of eighty (80) square feet and with a minimum dimension of five (5) feet may be substituted. This substitution, if so agreed upon by all parties, must be constructed within the designated front setback area for the particular property as set forth in the Chatsworth City Zoning Ordinance.
When a railroad or utility right-of-way separates the property from a county right-of-way, the planting strip requirement and the tree planting requirements must still be met.

Internal Lot Planting Requirements. Whenever the impervious cover of a lot exceeds ten thousand (10,000) square feet, an area equal to five (5) percent of the total impervious surface must be provided for landscaping and tree planting. Tree planting is required at the rate of one (1) tree per ten thousand (10,000) square feet of impervious cover.
Trees must be planted within the paved area so that no parking space is more than ninety (90) feet from a tree. Minimum unpaved landscape area per tree shall be one hundred sixty (160) square feet with a minimum dimension of eight (8) feet.
When a building permit is requested for the renovation of a site previously developed, internal tree planting is still required; and the minimum planting area shall be one hundred sixty (160) square feet per tree. Five (5) percent of the total impervious cover must be open for landscape purposes.
c.
Tree specifications. The trees to be planted must be from an approved list supplied by the City.

Roof Top Mounted Antennas. Rooftop mounted communications towers and antennae may be located on any nonresidential buildings and alternative tower structures in the City of Chatsworth so long as:

b.
The existing free-standing nonresidential structure other than a tower on which such tower or antenna will be placed is fifty (50) feet in height or greater and the tower and antenna will add no more than twenty (20) feet total to the height of said existing structure;
c.
No signs or illumination are permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the enforcement officer may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views; and
d.
The number and location of antennae, communication towers or other receiving or transmitting devices located on a single structure that is not excessive and does not adversely affect adjacent properties and views.
3.
Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of communication towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. Tower owners shall conduct periodic inspections of communication towers at least once every three years to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in the State of Georgia.
4.
Regulatory Compliance. All towers and antennae must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennae.

Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communication tower is in compliance with all federal requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months.
5.
Security. Communication towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device.
6.
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the Zoning Board of Appeals may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
7.
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower.
8.
Visual Impact.
a.
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b.
At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
c.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
d.
Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design.
e.
Towers shall be at a minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower.
9.
Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows:
a.
A buffer area no less than 6 feet wide shall commence at the property line.
b.
The buffer zone is to consist of materials of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet in height within two years of planting.
c.
Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed 20 feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff/maintenance.
d.
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
e.
In lieu of these standards, the Enforcement Officer may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions above, except as lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
