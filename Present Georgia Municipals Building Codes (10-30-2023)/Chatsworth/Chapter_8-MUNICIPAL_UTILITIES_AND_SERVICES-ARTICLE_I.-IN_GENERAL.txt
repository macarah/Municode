  ;note; *Total cost includes engineering but does not include the 75% federal grant.
;note; **Proportionate factor for these facilities is the ratio of the amount of the industrial waste to the design capacity of the facility, both in MGD.
;note; X = Industrial flow in MGD.
(b)
Basis: The amount of the surcharge shall be based on the population equivalent (PE) the waste occupies in the sewage treatment plant. One PE shall be defined as 0.17 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand per day or 0.17 pounds suspended solids or 100 gallons (13.33 cubic feet) per day of flow, whichever is greater.
(c)
Rate: The sewage treatment plant, designed for a PE of 7,500 costs $36,400.00 yearly to operate and maintain at the present time. This cost of operation will vary each year and therefore is subject to change. The cost using the above figure is $4.85 per PE per year. The rate of surcharge shall therefore be $0.40 per PE per month which amounts to persons discharging industrial waste to the public sewers paying for the capacity their waste occupies in the sewage treatment plant in excess of the values stated above in subsection (a)(1) and (a)(2).
(d)
Future waste contributors: When it becomes necessary after July 1, 1976, to increase the capacity of any of the above facilities to provide sewerage service and sewage treatment to any future industrial contributor, or to increase the capacity due to an increase in flow and/or strength of the waste of any industrial contributor being served as of the date of the enactment of this section, such future and existing industrial contributor shall pay its prorata share of such improvements plus its prorata share of the costs listed under subsection (a)(1) and (2) above.
(Ord. of 11-22-76(1); Ord. of 6-7-77(1))
Sec. 8-10. - Consumer's responsibility and liability as to water.
Water furnished by the city shall be used for consumption by the consumer, members of the consumer's household and employees only. The consumer shall not sell water to any other person or permit any other person to use water. Water shall not be used for irrigation, fire protection, or other purpose, except when water is available in sufficient quantity without interfering with the regular domestic consumption in the area served. Disregard for this rule shall be sufficient cause for refusal and/or discontinuance of service.
(1)
Where a meter or meter box is placed on the premises of a consumer, a suitable place shall be provided by the consumer therefor, unobstructed and accessible at all times to the meter reader.
(2)
The consumer shall furnish and maintain a private cutoff valve on the consumer's side of the meter.
(3)
The consumer's piping and apparatus shall be installed and maintained by the consumer at the consumer's expense, in a safe and efficient manner, and in accordance with the sanitary regulations of the state department of human resources.
(4)
In order to be received as a consumer and entitled to receive water from the city's water system, all applicants must offer proof that any private wells located on their property are not physically connected to the lines of the city's water system and all applicants by becoming consumers of the city covenant and agree that so long as they continue to be consumers of the city they will not permit the connection of any private wells on their property to the city's water system.
(Ord. of 10-30-73, § 6)
Sec. 8-11. - Access to premises and extensions of system.
(a)
Duly authorized agents of the city shall have access at all hours to the premises of the consumer for the purpose of installing or removing city property, inspecting piping, reading and testing meters, or for any other purpose in connection with the water service and its facilities, and the sewer service and its facilities.
(b)
Extensions to the system shall be made only when the consumer shall grant or convey, or shall cause to be granted or conveyed, to the city a permanent easement or right-of-way across any property traversed by the water and sewer lines.
(Ord. of 10-30-73, § 7)
Sec. 8-12. - Discontinuing service by consumer; changing occupancy.
Not less than three days' notice must be given, in person or in writing, at the city hall to discontinue water and sewer service or to change occupancy. The outgoing party shall be responsible for all water consumed up to the time of departure or the time specified for departure, whichever period is longer. The new occupant shall apply for water service within 48 hours after occupying the premises and failure to do so will make such person liable for paying for the water consumed since the preceding meter reading.
(Ord. of 10-30-73, § 8)
Sec. 8-13. - Billings; collecting.
Bills to customers for water and sewer service shall be mailed out on such days of each month as may be determined as desirable by the city. Bills shall be paid at the water department building; a failure to receive bills or notices shall not prevent such bills from becoming delinquent or relieve the consumer from payment of same. The failure of water and/or sewer users to pay charges duly imposed shall result in the automatic imposition of the following penalties:
(1)
Nonpayment within ten days from the due date will ensure a penalty of ten percent of the delinquent account.
(2)
Nonpayment within 15 days from the date due will result in the water being shut off from the water user's property.
(3)
Nonpayment for 45 days after original due date will allow the city, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to terminate agreement, and in such event, the water user shall not be entitled to receive, nor the city obligated to supply, any water under the agreement.
Service disconnected for nonpayment of bills will be restored only after bills are paid in full, such security deposit as may be required by the governing body is made, and a service charge of $10.00 is paid for each meter reconnected.
(Ord. of 10-30-73, § 9)
Sec. 8-14. - Suspension of service.
When water and sewer service is discontinued and all bills paid, the security deposit shall be refunded to the consumer by the city.
(1)
Upon discontinuance of service for nonpayment of bill, the security deposit will be applied by the city toward settlement of the account. Any balance will be refunded to the consumer; however, if the security deposit is insufficient to cover the bill, the city may proceed to collect the balance in the usual way provided by law for collection of debts.
(2)
The city reserves a right to discontinue its service without notice for the following additional reasons:
a.
To prevent fraud or abuse.
b.
Consumer's willful disregard of the city's rules.
c.
Emergency repairs.
d.
Insufficiency of water supply due to circumstances beyond the city's control.
e.
Legal processes.
f.
Direction of public authorities.

(Ord. of 10-30-73, § 10)
Sec. 8-15. - Complaints; adjustments.
If the consumer believes the bill to be in error, such owner may present a claim, in person, at the city hall before the bill becomes delinquent. Such claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent, shall not be effective in preventing discontinuance of service as heretofore provided. The consumer may pay such bill under protest and such payment shall not prejudice the claim.
(1)
The city will make a special water meter reading at the request of a consumer for a fee of $0.00 provided, however, that if such special reading discloses that the meter was over-read, no charge will be made.
(2)
Water meters will be tested at the request of the consumer upon payment to the city of the actual cost of making the test; provided, however, that if the meter is found to over-register beyond three percent of the correct volume, no charge will be made.
(3)
If the seal of a meter is broken by other than the city's representative or if the meter fails to register correctly or is stopped for any cause, the consumer shall pay an amount estimated from the record of the previous bills and/or from other proper data.
