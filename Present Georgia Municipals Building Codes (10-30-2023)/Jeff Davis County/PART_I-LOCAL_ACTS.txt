Editor's note— O.C.G.A. § 36-5-20 strikes the words "roads and revenues" from the official names of all Georgia counties.
Sec. 1A. - Commissioner districts.
(1)
The Board of Commissioners of Jeff Davis County as it exists immediately prior to January 1, 2006, is continued in existence but on and after January 1, 2006, shall be constituted as provided in this act. The Board of Commissioners of Jeff Davis County so continued and constituted, sometimes referred to in this act as the 'board,' shall continue to have the powers, duties, rights, obligations, and liabilities of that board as existed immediately prior to January 1, 2006, and shall be subject to all constitutional and statutory provisions relating to boards of county commissioners.
(2)
Those members of the Board of Commissioners of Jeff Davis County who are serving as such immediately prior to January 1, 2006, and any person selected to fill a vacancy in any such office shall continue to serve as such members until the regular expiration of their respective terms of office and upon the election and qualification of their respective successors. On and after January 1, 2006, the Board of Commissioners of Jeff Davis County shall consist of five members all of whom shall be elected from commissioner districts described in paragraph (3) of this subsection. Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they exist immediately prior to January 1, 2006, shall continue to be designated as Commissioner districts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, but as newly described under this act, and on and after January 1, 2006, such members of the board serving from those former commissioner districts shall be deemed to be serving from and representing their respective districts as newly described under this act.
(3)
For purposes of electing members of the board of commissioners, Jeff Davis County is divided into five commissioner districts. One member of the board shall be elected from each such district by majority vote of the qualified voters residing within such commissioner district. The five commissioner districts shall be and correspond to those five numbered districts described in and attached to and made a part of this act and further identified as plan name: jeffdccsbw3 plan type: local user: staff administrator: Jeff Davis.
Editor's note— The plan is included in this chapter as article II.
(4)
When used in such attachment, the terms 'Tract' and 'bg' (Block Group) shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the state of Georgia. The separate numeric designations in a tract description which are underneath a 'BG' heading shall mean and describe individual blocks within a block group as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the state of Georgia. Any part of Jeff Davis County which is not included in any such district described in that attachment shall be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the state of Georgia. Any part of Jeff Davis County which is described in that attachment as being in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the state of Georgia. Except as otherwise provided in the description of any commissioner district, whenever the description of such district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the state of Georgia."
(1983 Ga. Laws (Act No. 394), p. 4334; 1984 Ga. Laws (Act No. 614), p. 3688; 1989 Ga. Laws (Act No. 94), p. 3998; 2005 Ga. Laws (Act No. 273), p. 3896)
Editor's note— 1989 Ga. Laws (Act No. 94), p. 3998, erroneously refers to subsection (b) as subsection (d). In addition, 2005 Ga. Laws (Act No. 273), p. 3896, amended subsection (a) but failed to repeal obsolete former subsection (b) which has been omitted from the above section in this printing. For historical reference, the omitted subsection (b), read: "In order to stagger the terms of the board of county commissioners, the terms of office for members from Commissioner district number 4 and Commissioners district number 5 elected at the general election of 1992 shall be two years. Thereafter, beginning with the general election of 1994, the terms of such commissioners shall revert back to four years each."
Sec. 2. - Chairperson; compensation of board members and county clerk.
The board shall elect a chairperson who shall serve at the pleasure of the board. The compensation of the chairperson shall be no less than $250.00 monthly and no greater than $600.00 monthly, the precise amount to be determined by the chairperson. The compensation of the other members of the board shall be no less than $200.00 monthly and no greater than $500.00 monthly, the precise amount to be determined by the chairperson, provided that such compensation shall be equal for the members of the board other than the chairperson. The compensation of the clerk shall be set by the board. Such compensation shall be paid from the funds of Jeff Davis County. Each member of the board and the chairperson shall receive $100.00 per month as other compensation for expenses. Such expense allowance shall be paid out of the general funds of the county.
