(1)
Except as otherwise provided in this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented.
(2)
The buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to the Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq. shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within such buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed.
(b)
50-foot buffers. The following shall be the buffer specifications for 50-foot buffers:
(1)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented.
(2)
No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed.

(Ord. of 7-19-2010, art. 1, § A)
Sec. 14-177. - Findings of fact.
The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Ord. of 7-19-2010, art. 1, § B)
Sec. 14-178. - Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(5)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Ord. of 7-19-2010, art. 1, § C)
Sec. 14-179. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
(3)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
(4)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(5)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(6)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
(7)
Ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

(Ord. of 7-19-2010, art. 4, § B)
Sec. 14-279. - Floodways.
A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. The area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
(2)
Only if subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.
(Ord. of 7-19-2010, art. 4, § B)
Sec. 14-280. - Streams without established base flood elevations or floodways (A zones).
(a)
In locations in the areas of special flood hazard where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones) or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply:
(1)
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided, then the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (3) of this section shall apply.
(2)
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(3)
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data:
a.
New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of this article.
b.
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.
(b)
The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(Ord. of 7-19-2010, art. 4, § C)
Sec. 14-281. - Areas with base flood elevations but without designated floodways (AE zones).
For areas located within the areas of special flood hazard where streams with base flood elevations are provided, but no floodways have been designated (AE zones), the following provisions apply:
(1)
No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(2)
New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with this article.
(Ord. of 7-19-2010, art. 4, § D)
Sec. 14-282. - Shallow flooding areas (AO zones).
Areas of special flood hazard may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel.
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided. The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(2)
New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above and shall provide such certification to the official.
(3)
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(Ord. of 7-19-2010, art. 4, § E)

Secs. 14-285—14-301. - Reserved.
DIVISION 5. - VARIANCES

Sec. 14-302. - Conditions required for issuance of variance; factors considered.
(a)
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. In reviewing requests for variance, the county board of commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(b)
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(c)
A variance shall be issued only when there is a finding of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the county board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.
(Ord. of 7-19-2010, art. 5)
Sec. 14-303. - Notice to applicant regarding cost of flood insurance.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(Ord. of 7-19-2010, art. 5)
Sec. 14-304. - Administrator to maintain record of variances.
The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency upon request.
