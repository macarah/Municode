Sec. 34-117. - Proper abandonment of wells.
(a)
Procedure for proper abandonment of wells. Only certified well contractors, acting as agents of property owners, are allowed to abandon wells in accordance with the procedures in this section.
(1)
Temporarily abandoned well. A water well shall be considered as temporarily abandoned when its use has been interrupted for a period of more than one year, but not more than three years. Such wells shall be sealed and maintained to prevent them from being or becoming a source or channel of pollution when not in service.
(2)
Permanently abandoned well. A water well shall be considered as permanently abandoned when its service has been interrupted for three years or it is determined by the department to be abandoned. Such wells shall be properly abandoned permanently by the owners.
(3)
Procedures for the temporary abandonment of wells.
a.
Casing. A temporarily abandoned well shall be protected with a casing.
b.
Watertight seal. Upon temporary removal from service, the well shall be sealed with a watertight cap or seal compatible with the casing, and installed so that it cannot be easily removed.
c.
Maintenance. The well and immediate area shall be kept clear of debris and brush, inspected, and maintained by the owner so it is not a source or channel of contamination. The board of health may require the well to be suitably marked or placarded with a temporary abandonment warning.
(4)
Procedures for the permanent abandonment of wells.
a.
Casing removal. The entire well casing and materials should be removed before well closure if such removal will not contaminate the aquifer. Any casing not grouted in accordance with this article shall be removed or properly grouted. Prior to removing the casing, a neat cement plug shall also be added below the lower extremity of the casing. If the contractor is unsuccessful in removing the casing, then a portion of the casing shall be removed to a depth of at least three feet below the ground surface, and a neat cement plug shall also be added at this portion of the casing.
b.
Sounding. The entire well shall be sounded before sealing to ensure that obstructions will not interfere with sealing operations.
c.
Disinfection. The well shall be thoroughly disinfected prior to sealing. (See subsection 34-116(6)(b)).
d.
Bored wells. Bored wells (including hand dug) shall be completely filled with cement grout, dry clay, or material excavated during drilling of the well, then compacted in place.
e.
Wells in unconsolidated formations. Wells other than bored wells constructed in unconsolidated formations, consisting of sand, sand and clay, or other similar formations, shall be completely filled with cement grout by introducing it through a pipe extending to the bottom of the which can be raised as the well is filled.
f.
Wells in consolidated formations. Wells, constructed in consolidated formations (consisting of crystalline or metamorphic rock) which penetrate zones of consolidated rock, may be filled with cement, sand, gravel, or drill cuttings opposite the zones of consolidated rock. The top of the sand, gravel, or cutting fill shall be at least five feet below the top of the consolidated rock. The remainder of the well shall be filled with cement grout only.
g.
Test wells not penetrating water table. Test wells which do not penetrate the water table, shall be abandoned in such manner as to prevent the well from being a channel or source of contamination to the aquifer as approved by the board of health.
h.
Test wells penetrating water table. Test wells or borings that penetrate the water table shall be sealed by completely filling with cement grout.
(Res. No. 05-0616, 5-18-05; Ord. No. 18-0340, Att. A, 5-16-18)
Sec. 34-118. - Water samples.
(a)
Sampling technique. The following sampling techniques shall be practiced.
(1)
Bacteriological sampling procedure. A water sample must be taken by the board of health. Only the water to be analyzed shall come in contact with the inside of the bottle or the cap; the water sample must flow into the bottle without touching the hands or any other object while it is being filled. If the water is collected from a sample tap, turn on the tap and allow the water to flow for two or three minutes before collecting the sample. Do not rinse the sample bottle. The sample should be delivered to the laboratory as soon as possible and in no case more than 30 hours after its collection. During delivery, the sample should be kept as cool as possible, but not frozen. The frequency of bacteriological sampling for the various types of water supplies is as follows:
a.
Private water supply. The sample results must be satisfactory for new and existing wells to be approved for use.
1.
New well. Sampling shall be required upon completion of construction and following the disinfection of the system. The sample results must be satisfactory before final construction can be approved. Disinfection and sampling must be continued until satisfactory results are obtained.
2.
Existing well. Upon the request by the property owner, the board of health will sample the supply to determine the bacteriological quality, provided the well construction meets the article requirements. Sampling of unapproved or noncomplying wells shall be at the department's discretion. A fee shall be charged for this service.
b.
Semi-public water supply. The sample results must be satisfactory for new and existing wells to be approved for use.
1.
New well. Sampling shall be required upon the completion of construction and following the disinfection of the system. The sample results must be satisfactory before final construction can be approved. Disinfection and sampling must be continued until satisfactory results are obtained.
2.
Existing well. Existing wells shall be sampled on a quarterly basis (a minimum of four times per year). Additional sampling may be required to ensure compliance with this article and permit requirements. A fee shall be charged for service.
(2)
Chemical sampling procedure. A water sample for chemical analysis shall be collected after the well has been pumped long enough to remove standing water, residue, and disinfectant chemicals, and to ensure that water from the aquifer has entered the well. The water sample shall be collected in a chemically clean container, preferably one obtained from the laboratory that will perform the analysis. Prior to collecting the sample, the container shall be rinsed several times with the water to be sampled. The laboratory performing the analysis shall provide instructions regarding the quantity of sample required and whether preservatives are needed. In all cases the temperature of the water should be determined (measured) immediately upon collection of the sample. Owners and laboratories must report to the board of health all sample results including those not meeting the standards in this article. The frequency of chemical sampling for the types of water supplies is as follows:
a.
Private water supply. No chemical analysis shall be required unless deemed necessary by the board of health.
b.
Semi-public water supply. The sample results must be satisfactory for new or existing wells to be approved for use.
1.
New well. Samples shall be required upon the completion of the construction and following disinfection of the system. The sample results must be satisfactory before final construction can be approved. Disinfection and sampling must be continued until satisfactory results are obtained.
2.
Existing well. Samples to measure physical quality may be required at the department's discretion as necessary and/or when the supply is suspected of unfitness due to odor, color, turbidity or other concerns about possible contamination.
(3)
Physical sampling procedure. A water sample for physical analysis shall be collected after the well has been pumped long enough to remove standing water, development and disinfectant chemicals, and water from the aquifer has entered the well. The water sample shall be collected in a clean container, preferably one obtained from the laboratory that will perform the analysis. The container shall be rinsed several times with the water to be sampled. The laboratory performing the analysis shall provide instructions regarding the quantity of sample required and whether preservatives are needed. In all cases the temperature of the water should be determined (measured) immediately upon collection of the sample. Owners and laboratories must report to this department all sample results, including those not meeting the standards in this article. The frequency of physical analysis for the types of water supplies is as follows:
a.
Private water supply. No physical analysis shall be required unless deemed necessary by the department.
b.
Semi-public water supply. The sample results must be satisfactory for new and existing wells to be approved for use.
1.
New well. Sampling shall be required upon the completion of the construction and following disinfection of the system. The sample results must be satisfactory before final construction can be approved. Decontamination and sampling must be continued until satisfactory results are obtained.
2.
Existing well. Samples to measure physical quality may be required at the department's discretion as necessary and/or when the supply is suspected of unfitness due to odor, color, or turbidity.
(b)
Bacteriological limits. Presence of coliform bacteria in water is presumptive evidence of sewage or animal pollution and the possible presence of disease-producing bacteria. No definite conclusions regarding the safety of a water supply can be drawn from a single bacteriological examination. If a water supply is developed and maintained to exclude contamination at all times, a sample demonstrating a coliform concentration below the standard gives reasonable assurance of a safe water supply. A sample is considered satisfactory and meeting the minimum bacteriological quality limits of this article if one or less coliform bacterium per 100 milliliters of sample is present.
(c)
Chemical limits. The presence of the following inorganic chemicals, in excess of the maximum contaminant levels listed, shall constitute grounds for rejection and non-approval of the water supply (see Table F, "Chemical Limits").
(d)
Physical limits. The water shall contain no impurity which would cause offense to the sense of sight, taste, or smell. The limits listed in Table G, "Physical Limits" shall not be exceeded.
(e)
Other sampling requirements. The frequency and manner of additional sampling, whether for other chemicals and/or for additional or more specific bacteriological analyses, shall be as determined by the board of health. If there is presumption of unfitness because of the presence of undesirable elements, compounds, or materials, periodic determinations for the suspected toxicant or material shall be made more frequently, and a sanitary survey shall also be made to determine the source. Where the concentration of a substance is not expected to increase in processing and distribution, available and acceptable source water analyses performed in accordance with standard methods may be used as evidence of compliance with this article.
(Res. No. 05-0616, 5-18-05; Ord. No. 18-0340, Att. A, 5-16-18)
Sec. 34-119. - Cross connection and back siphonage.
(a)
Cross connection. No person shall allow a public, private, or semi-public water supply to be connected, directly or indirectly, with any other water supply, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixture, or other device which contains or may contain contaminated water, liquid, gas, sewage (or other waste of unknown or unsafe quality) capable of contaminating the water system. No backflow or potential backflow will be allowed due to configuration bypass arrangement, jumper connections, removable section, swivel or changeover device, or other temporary, permanent, or potential connection.
(b)
Back siphonage. No outlet from a water supply shall be installed or maintained so that back siphonage is possible. Approved backflow preventer devices shall be required on all outlets to prevent contamination of the water supply and aquifer. The current procedure for backflow and back siphonage prevention and cross connection control shall conform to those recommended by the American Water Works Association (AWWA), "Manual 14", and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "Cross Connection Manual".
