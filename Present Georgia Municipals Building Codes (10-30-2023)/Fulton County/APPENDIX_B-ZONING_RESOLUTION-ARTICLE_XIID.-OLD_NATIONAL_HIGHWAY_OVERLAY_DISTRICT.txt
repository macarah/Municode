This Resolution is adopted as part of a strategy designed to promote the health, safety, order, prosperity, and general welfare of the citizens of Fulton County through the regulation of design, aesthetics, location, bulk, size of buildings and structures, and the density and distribution of population.
This Resolution also seeks to reduce congestion on the streets; to provide safety from fire, flood and other dangers; provide adequate light and open space; protect the natural environment and address other public requirements, in order to provide sustainable development that involves the simultaneous pursuit of economic prosperity, environmental protection and social quality.
This Resolution also seeks, among other things, to promote accepted design principles in areas of new development and redevelopment, to raise the level of community understanding and expectation for quality in the built environment, to protect and enhance local aesthetic and functional qualities, and to stimulate business and promote economic development.
In consideration of the character of the Old National Highway District, these regulations are to monitor the suitability for certain uses, construction and design, prevent functional and visual disunity, promote desirable conditions for community and commerce and protect property against blight and depreciation.
