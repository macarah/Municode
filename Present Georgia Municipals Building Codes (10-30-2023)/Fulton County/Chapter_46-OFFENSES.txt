Sec. 46-140. - Juvenile curfew.
modified
(a)
Title of section. This section shall be known as the Fulton County Juvenile Curfew Ordinance.
(b)
Findings and purpose. It is the responsibility of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Fulton County. The Fulton County Board of Commissioners is concerned about the increase in criminal activity engaged in by minors especially those crimes that occur after hours and/or times in which juveniles should be at home. During public hearings held in Fulton County, many parents voiced their concerns about the increase in youth violence, the need to protect our children from being victims of crimes that occur after hours, and the need to make parents more responsible for their children. These parents have stated that a child curfew ordinance is one initiative in protecting our children from being the victims and perpetrators of crime. In an effort to keep our communities drug free and our streets safe by reducing the numbers of crimes that are committed by and against minors after hours, the board of commissioners believes that a child curfew ordinance is in the best interest of the citizens of Fulton County. As one parent expressed at a public hearing, "a juvenile curfew ordinance is an attempt by Fulton County to save at least one child's life." Accordingly, the Fulton County Board of Commissioners finds and declares that the purpose of this section is to reduce the number of crimes committed by and against juveniles after hours, and to safeguard the welfare of our children in areas in unincorporated Fulton County.

DIVISION 2. - LOITERING[2]

Footnotes:
--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 11-0894, adopted Oct. 5, 2011, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 46-141—46-144. For purposes of classification, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as Div. 2 and the former Div. 2 "False Alarms" has been renumbered as Div. 3.

Sec. 46-141. - Generally.
(a)
It shall be unlawful within the unincorporated area of the county for any person to remain or loiter in front of any public place, or on the sidewalks or public streets or roads of the county after having been directed by a police officer or other member of law enforcement to move away therefrom.
(b)
A person commits the offense of loitering when the person is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.
(c)
Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself or herself and explain his or her presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer fails to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.
(Ord. No. 11-0894, Exh. A, 10-5-11)
Sec. 46-142. - Loitering for purpose of procuring others to engage in sexual acts for hire.
(a)
Legislative findings and intent.
(1)
The board of commissioners finds that sex acts for hire are inherently exploitative, endanger the health, safety and welfare of the participants and citizens in general, affect property values, and are an affront to the dignity of our citizens. These exploitative acts adversely affect a property or area in which they occur and lead to the avoidance of such places by law-abiding citizens, lead to an increased opportunity for unlawful criminal activities, and further decays neighborhoods.
(2)
The county has a strong interest: (i) in ensuring that citizens feel safe in their neighborhoods, (ii) in protecting the health of its citizens, (iii) in safeguarding the economic vitality of its business districts, and, (iv) in preserving peace and order in public places to enable them to be used for their intended purposes.
(3)
Loitering for purpose of procuring others to engage in sex acts for hire usually includes a power imbalance between those seeking to purchase the sexual services and those being exploited to perform the sex acts, with the persons procuring the sexual services tending to be more economically and socially advantaged than the people who would provide the sex acts. A person seeking to purchase the sexual services bears a greater responsibility for the transaction than does the person being prostituted. Furthermore, it is widely acknowledged by criminal justice experts that holding purchasers, or "johns," principally accountable for these sex acts for hire is the most effective method available to reduce the incidence of prostitution in an area.
(4)
This section is not intended to limit any person from exercising the right to assemble or engage in any other constitutionally protected activity. This section applies to all persons with the requisite intent to induce another to engage in sex acts for hire.
(b)
It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter, as defined in section 46-141, in or near any thoroughfare or place open to the public in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose of inducing, enticing, soliciting, pandering, or procuring another to commit a sexual act for hire. This section is not intended to limit any person from exercising their right to assemble or engage in any other constitutionally protected activity. This section applies to all persons with the requisite intent to induce another to engage in a sexual act for hire.
(c)
A police officer who observes a person loitering under circumstances that provide the officer with an articulable suspicion to believe a sexual act for hire has occurred or is occurring may detain the individual for the purpose of investigating whether the person is in violation of this section.
(d)
A police officer may detain an individual under this section if an element from subsection (1) and an element from subsection (2) below are satisfied:
(1)
The person engages in one or more of the following behaviors:
a.
Repeatedly circling the block in a motor vehicle;
b.
Stopping a motor vehicle in a county roadway to beckon to, stop, or engage with persons on the side of the road;
c.
Repeatedly stopping or attempting to stop motor vehicle operators by hailing, waving of arms or any bodily gesture;
d.
Driving around or sitting in a parked car in a parking lot or vacant lot; or
(2)
One of the following factors applies:
a.
The officer has knowledge of a specific reliable tip concerning unlawful prostitution-related activity at a specific location, and the person who is found loitering is doing so at a time, in a place or in a manner that is otherwise consistent with the details provided in the tip;
b.
The person is loitering in an area that is known to be a common location for prostitution-related activity;
c.
The person is on the premises of a hotel or other business that is associated with an advertisement for prostitution-related activity;
d.
The person is a non-resident of the area, and is present in the area outside of normal business hours and without legitimate business in the area;
e.
The officer knows that the person has been previously convicted of loitering with the intention of procuring others to engage in sexual acts for hire under this section; or
f.
Any vehicle the person has approached or communicated through is registered to an individual who has been convicted of an unlawful prostitution-related activity in the previous three years, and the officer is aware of that fact.
(e)
For purposes of this section "sexual act for hire" means conduct which constitutes an offense defined in O.C.G.A. tit. 16, ch. 6, as amended; conduct which constitutes complicity to commit such an offense; or conduct which constitutes conspiracy to commit such an offense.
(f)
Any person in violation of this section shall be guilty of the offense of loitering for the purpose of committing a sexual act for hire.
(Ord. No. 11-0894, Exh. A, 10-5-11; Ord. No. 17-0211, 3-1-17)
Sec. 46-143. - For purposes of engaging in drug-related activity.
(a)
Legislative findings and intent.
(1)
The board of commissioners finds that the increase throughout the county of loitering in public places for the purposes of unlawful drug-related activity, or in effect, "open air" drug dealing, has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses. This activity has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places, but also to an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation and disorder.
(2)
Loitering for purposes of unlawful drug-related activity usually includes a dominant presence of those persons engaging in such activity as they approach pedestrians and persons in vehicles. Such activity also encourages the presence of vehicle and pedestrian traffic for the purpose of unlawful drug-related activity in and out of residential areas, to or from motor vehicles or in parking lots. Such presence carries with it an implicit threat to visitors and residents to avoid the use of these public places. The avoidance of such places by law-abiding citizens leads, in turn, to an increased opportunity for the unlawful criminal activity and furthers the decay of the neighborhood.
(3)
The county has a strong interest in ensuring that citizens feel safe in their neighborhoods, in safeguarding the economic vitality of its business districts, and in preserving peace and order in public places for their intended purposes.
(4)
This section is not intended to limit any person from exercising their right to assemble or engage in any other constitutionally protected activity. This section applies to all persons with the requisite intent to induce another to engage in unlawful drug-related activity.
(b)
It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter, as defined in section 46-141, in or near any thoroughfare, place open to the public, or any public or private place in order to induce, entice, solicit or procure another to engage in unlawful drug-related activity.
(1)
"Unlawful drug-related activity" means conduct which constitutes an offense defined in O.C.G.A. tit. 16, ch. 13, as amended; conduct which constitutes complicity to commit such an offense by, for example, acting as a lookout; or conduct which constitutes conspiracy to commit such an offense.
(c)
A police officer who observes a person loitering under circumstances that provide the officer with an articulable suspicion to believe unlawful drug-related activity is occurring or has occurred may detain the individual for the purpose of investigating whether the person is in violation of this section.
(d)
A police officer may not detain an individual under this section unless both of the following elements are satisfied:
(1)
The person engages in one or more of the following behaviors:
a.
The person passes or receives from a passer-by, bystander or person in a motor vehicle money, objects having characteristics consistent with controlled substances, and/or an envelope, bag or other container that could reasonably contain such objects or money;
b.
The person conceals or attempts to conceal an object having characteristics consistent with controlled substances and/or an envelope, bag, clear plastic baggie or other container that could reasonably contain such objects;
c.
The person flees or obscures himself upon seeing law enforcement officers;
d.
The person communicates the fact that law enforcement officers are in the vicinity to another person in a manner that suggests that the communication is a warning; or
e.
The officer observes the person in possession of any instrument or object that is designed or marketed as useful primarily for one or more of the following purposes:
1.
To inject, ingest, inhale or otherwise introduce marijuana or a controlled substance into the human body;
2.
To enhance the effect of marijuana or a controlled substance on the human body;
3.
To test the strength, effectiveness, or purity of marijuana or a controlled substance;
4.
To process or prepare marijuana or a controlled substance for introduction into the human body;
5.
To conceal any quantity of marijuana or a controlled substance; or
6.
To contain or hold marijuana or a controlled substance while it is being introduced into the human body.
(2)
One of the following factors applies:
a.
The officer is aware that, within the preceding three years, the person has been convicted of an offense defined in O.C.G.A. tit. 16, ch. 13, or of complicity to commit such an offense, or of conspiracy to commit such an offense with in the preceding three years;
b.
The officer has knowledge of a specific reliable tip concerning unlawful drug-related activity at a specific location, and the person who is found loitering is doing so at a time, in a place or in a manner that is otherwise consistent with the details provided in the tip;
c.
The person is loitering in an area that has been designated a notorious drug-related activity area as defined in subsection (g), below;
d.
The person is in an area where he is prohibited by court order from being, and the officer is aware of the court order;
e.
The officer knows that the person has been previously convicted of loitering with the intention of engaging in unlawful drug-related activity under this section; or
f.
Any vehicle the person has approached or communicated through is registered to an individual who has been convicted of an unlawful drug-related activity in the previous three years, and the officer is aware of that fact.
(e)
No arrest may be made for a violation of this section unless the arresting officer first affords the person an opportunity to explain the person's presence and conduct, unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable to afford such an opportunity, and no one shall be convicted of violating this section if it appears at trial that the explanation given at the scene was true and disclosed a lawful purpose.
(f)
If a police officer who detains a person pursuant to this section has an articulable suspicion to believe that the person is in violation of this section, the officer may order the person to immediately leave the location and to remain at least 500 feet away from the location for at least five hours. In the event that person refuses to comply with such an order, the police officer may arrest the person and charge him with a violation of this section.
(g)
The board of commissioners may, by written directive and after consultation with the chief of police, clearly and publicly designate areas of the unincorporated county that are frequently associated with excessive incidents of drug-related offenses, including offenses involving controlled substances (as defined in O.C.G.A. tit. 16, ch. 13) or marijuana. The chief of police shall file such designations with the clerk to the board of commissioners and with the clerk of the superior court. Prior to recommending such a determination under this subsection, the chief of police shall consult, as he or she deems appropriate, with persons who are knowledgeable about the effects of drug-related activity in areas in which this section may be enforced. Such persons may include, but need not be limited to, members of the department of police with special training or experience related to drug-related activity; other personnel of that department with particular knowledge of drug-related activities in the proposed designated area; appointed and elected officials of the area; and community based organizations. The chief of police shall develop and implement procedures for the bi-annual review and update of any designations made under this subsection.
(h)
Severability. If any portion of this section or the application thereof shall be held invalid or unconstitutional, the other provisions of this section shall not be affected, and to this end the provisions of this section are declared to be severable.

DIVISION 3. - FALSE ALARMS[3]

Footnotes:
--- (3) ---
Note— See the editor's note to Div. 2.

Sec. 46-171. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Burglar alarm system means any assembly of equipment or device, whether mechanical or electrical, arranged or designed to signal by any means the occurrence of an illegal entry into the premises or any other activity requiring urgent police attention and to which the police department may reasonably be expected to respond; provided, however, that this definition does not include alarm systems installed exclusively for the purpose of signaling a robbery, a fire or a medical emergency, and does not include any alarm system installed in a motor vehicle.
Burglar alarm user means the person or other entity which owns, leases, rents, manages, possesses or has primary control over the premises in which a burglar alarm system is installed or maintained.
Chief of police means the Chief of the Fulton County Police Department or his designee.
False alarm means the activation of a signal from a burglar alarm system which elicits a response from the police department when there is in fact no emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity necessitating such a response. This definition includes, without being limited to, any burglar alarm system signal activated as a result of weather, negligence, accident, mechanical failure, electrical failure, electrical surge, signals activated intentionally in nonemergency situations and signals activated where the actual cause of such activation is unknown. There is a rebuttable presumption that an activated burglar alarm system signal is a false alarm if the responding police personnel, after following normal police procedures in their response and investigation, find no evidence of unauthorized entry, criminal activity or other emergency. An activated burglar alarm system signal shall not be considered a false alarm if:
(1)
The police department is notified to cancel its response by the burglar alarm user or the burglar alarm user's monitoring agent prior to the time police personnel arrive at the premises;
(2)
The burglar alarm system signal was intentionally activated by an individual based upon a reasonable belief that an emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity requiring immediate police response existed;
(3)
The burglar alarm system signal was activated by lightening or other act of nature resulting in an electrical surge which causes physical damage to the burglar alarm system and which damage is evidenced by the written report of a licensed burglar alarm system contractor who conducted an inspection of the system at the premises and personally observed such physical damage; or
(4)
The burglar alarm system combines both burglar and fire alarm functions and the alarm user demonstrates that the system signal was activated by the fire alarm portion of the system.
Police department means the Fulton County Police Department.
Premises means the building or structure or any portion of a building or structure in which there is installed or maintained a burglar alarm system.
(Ord. No. 97-0145, § 1(27-1-4(b)), 1-22-97)
Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 46-172. - Legislative findings and purposes of division.
The board of commissioners finds that police response to false burglar alarms creates additional risks to public safety by diverting limited law enforcement resources away from both real emergencies and normal patrol activities intended and designed to prevent criminal acts. Therefore, the purpose of this division is to promote public safety by making burglar alarm users in the unincorporated areas of Fulton County directly responsible for preventing false alarms.
(Ord. No. 97-0145, § 1(27-1-4(a)), 1-22-97)
Sec. 46-173. - Registration of burglar alarm systems.

(2)
The names of all persons authorized to enter the premises and deactivate the burglar alarm system signal as well as all phone numbers at which such persons can be reached;
(3)
The name and telephone number of the burglar alarm user's monitoring agent, if any; and
(4)
If known, the name and telephone number of the person or entity which installed the burglar alarm system.
(b)

(2)
For the fourth and each subsequent false alarm that occurs at the same premises within any calendar year, a fine shall be assessed in the amount of $100.00 for each false alarm.
(3)
For all other violations of this division, not including false alarms, a fine shall be assessed in the amount of $100.00.
