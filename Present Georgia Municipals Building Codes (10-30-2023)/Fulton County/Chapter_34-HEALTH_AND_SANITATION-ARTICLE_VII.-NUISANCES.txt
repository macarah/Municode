DIVISION 2. - OPIOID EPIDEMIC

Sec. 34-368. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose and intent of this Code section is to declare the opioid epidemic a public nuisance and ratify any actions taken by Fulton County and allow the Fulton County Board of Commissioners to continue to implement actions to address the same in Fulton County. The county provides services related to the opioid epidemic, which are funded by tax revenues. This Code section clarifies that reimbursement may be sought for the costs of providing such services, whenever practicable, from the responsible party or parties. Without limiting the ability of the county to initiate litigation against any and all parties involved in this crisis or impacting litigation currently pending which was authorized by the county prior to adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived, the county desires to establish a cost recovery procedure set forth in this division for all current and future litigation to address the opioid epidemic and its effects on the county as a public nuisance.
(18-0097, 2-7-18)
Sec. 34-369. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Costs means all expenditures related to the opioid epidemic that directly or indirectly arise from Fulton County's response to a responsible party's action or inaction.
Public nuisance is one which damages all persons who come within the sphere of its operation, though it may vary in its effects on individuals.
Responsible party means any person or corporation whose negligent, intentional, or otherwise wrongful conduct causes the incident resulting in Fulton County incurring costs or who is found liable or made responsible by a court for the costs incurred by Fulton County in the form of damages, regardless of the cause of action. This does not include the individuals whom are addicted to opioids.
(18-0097, 2-7-18)
Sec. 34-370. - Opioid abuse a public nuisance.
Fulton County hereby finds and declares the following:
(1)
That addiction to and abuse of opioids by Fulton County residents is one of the greatest challenges facing Fulton County;
(2)
A cause of this increasing crisis is the overabundance of prescription opioids. Vast amounts of prescription opioid pain pills were sold, distributed and prescribed in Fulton County over the past several years which practice continues today;
(3)
There is evidence showing that approximately four in five heroin users began their addiction by first using and then misusing prescription pain medications containing opioids;
(4)
The negligent and/or reckless selling, distributing, and prescribing of large amounts of opioid pain pills by responsible parties in Fulton County has created a public health and safety hazard affecting the residents of Fulton County, resulting in devastation to families in the county, a negative effect on Fulton County's economy, wasted public resources, and a generation of narcotic dependence;
(5)
That the negligent and/or reckless selling, distributing, and prescribing of prescription opioid pain pills by responsible parties is a hazard to public health and safety, which has created a public nuisance to the citizens of Fulton County, and said nuisance remains unabated;
(6)
That, in addition to all other powers and duties now conferred by law upon Fulton County, Fulton County is authorized to enact ordinances, issue orders, and take other appropriate and necessary actions for the elimination of hazards to public health and safety and to abate or cause to be abated anything which the board of commissioners determines to be a public nuisance;
(7)
That certain manufacturers of prescription opioids and those in the chain of distribution as responsible parties have wrongfully abused the privilege of selling and/or providing medication to Fulton County residents and must be held accountable; and
(8)
That it is the duty of Fulton County to vindicate the rights of Fulton County residents and take action to abate this public nuisance.
(18-0097, 2-7-18)
Sec. 34-371. - Governmental function cost recovery.
Fulton County has the power and has acted to recover the costs of governmental functions related to opioids marketed, sold, manufactured, dispensed, prescribed, and/or distributed by the responsible parties. If a responsible party fails to pay the costs demanded, Fulton County may initiate and recover costs through administrative, civil, and/or criminal action against the responsible party. In that case, Fulton County may also recover attorney's fees, interest, and any other payment or type of damages the court deems proper.
(18-0097, 2-7-18)
Sec. 34-372. - Effect of criminal or civil proceedings on governmental function cost recovery.
Fulton County's initiation of administrative or civil proceedings for governmental function cost recovery does not bar the criminal prosecution of a responsible party for any associated violation. Similarly, criminal prosecution does not bar civil collection of costs for the violation giving rise to the criminal prosecution.
(18-0097, 2-7-18)
Sec. 34-373. - Violation; penalty.
Violation of this Code division shall subject the violator to all damages recoverable under a civil proceeding. Criminal penalty for violation of this division shall be the same as promulgated in section 34-365 of article VII of this chapter.
(18-0097, 2-7-18)
Sec. 34-374. - Application.
This division shall apply to all pending or future actions taken by the county in furtherance of its efforts to address the opioid epidemic in Fulton County.
(18-0097, 2-7-18)
