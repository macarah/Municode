Appendix A4 - Combined Waste Formula
Combined Waste Stream Formula
Alternative limit calculation; for the purposes of these formulas, the "average daily flow" means a reasonable measure of the average daily flow for a 30-day period.
Alternative concentration limit:
CT
= the alternative concentration limit for the combined waste stream.
C i
= the categorical Pretreatment Standard concentration limit for a pollutant in the regulated stream I.
F i
= the average daily flow of the stream I to the extent that it is regulated for such pollutant.
F D
= the average daily flow from (a) Boiler blow down streams, non-contact cooling streams, storm water streams, (b) sanitary waste streams, © process waste streams exempted from Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
F T
= the average daily flow through the combined treatment facility (includes F i , F D , and unregulated streams).
N
= the total number of regulated streams.
Alternative mass limit:
M T
= the alternative mass limit for a pollutant in the combined waste stream.
M i
= the categorical Pretreatment Standard mass limit for a pollutant in the regulated stream 1 (the categorical pretreatment mass limit multiplied by the appropriate measure of production).
F i
= the average flow of stream I to the extent that it is regulated for such pollutant.
F D
= the average daily flow through the combined treatment facility (includes F i , F D , and unregulated streams).
N
= the total number of regulated streams.
