Sec. 34-513. - Field data procedures.
Percolation tests shall be performed by state-registered civil engineers and land surveyors or certified soils scientists. A property owner may be allowed to conduct percolation tests on his own individual lot only if deemed qualified by the board of health.
(1)
Percolation tests.
a.
Location. Percolation test holes shall be spaced at least 50 feet apart (spacing may be reduced if approved) and located in the area proposed for the absorption field. The holes shall not be located in floodplains, easements, nor in any other area restricted by this article. Test holes shall not be located in or near streams, draws, banks, stump holes or any other location where percolation test rates would not be representative of typical soil and terrain conditions. Tests holes shall be flagged, staked and numbered in accordance with the soil data record and site plan. All test hole locations including those with passing and failing results shall be shown, including depth of test holes.
b.
Preparation of test hole. Percolation test holes shall be dug or bored with vertical sides, shall be no less than four inches in width and shall extend to the proposed depth of the absorption field. On slopes less than 20 percent, minimum depth of test holes shall be 30 inches to 48 inches, and on slopes greater than 20 percent, the depth of test holes shall be 84 inches. On projects where grading in the field area is proposed, the test holes shall be 30 inches to 48 inches below the proposed finished elevation. Sides of test holes shall be scratched with a pointed instrument to remove smeared soil surfaces and to provide a more natural soil interface into which water may percolate. Loose material shall be removed and no less than two inches of clean gravel shall be added.
c.
Saturation and swelling of soil. Percolation test holes shall be filled with water (and kept completely filled in 30-inch to 48-inch test holes) and kept to an elevation at least three feet above the bottom of the deeper test holes until the soil is saturated and clays have had an opportunity to swell. No tests shall be performed until the soil has been soaked at least four consecutive hours. Overnight soaking is prohibited.
d.
Percolation rate measurement. After soaking, water depths in the percolation test holes shall be adjusted until approximately six inches of water remains over the gravel. From a fixed reference point, established at or near ground surface, repeated measurements shall be made at equal time intervals of the vertical distance in inches from the reference point to the water surface. Water shall be added to restore a six-inch depth if the water falls to less than two inches above the gravel surface. Measurements shall be continued until a constant percolation rate is evidenced, i.e., the water surface drops the same vertical distance each time interval. The time in minutes required for the water column to drop one inch at this constant rate shall be recorded as the percolation rate. When percolation rates vary significantly or exceed 90 minutes/inch fall within the proposed absorption field, additional tests may be required and data on all tests performed (passing and failing) must be submitted for review.
(2)
Borings.
a.
Location. Borings shall be located in areas proposed for the absorption field and shall not be located in floodplains, easements nor in any other area restricted by this article. Borings shall be flagged and numbered accordingly with the soil data record and site plan. All test hole locations, including those with passing and failing results, shall be shown including depth of borings.
b.
Water table borings. Borings to determine groundwater elevation in low areas may be required by the board of health. Borings shall be made to a minimum depth of seven feet. On projects where grading in the field area is proposed, the borings shall be at least seven feet below the proposed finished elevation. Water table elevations shall not be recorded until 48 hours have elapsed for stabilization of groundwater. Location, identification number and depth to water table shall be recorded on the site plan and soil data record. Other records of water table elevation, including seasonal peaks, may be submitted or required.
c.
Rock borings. Where surface outcroppings or subsurface rock or hardpan exist or are suspected, a sufficient number of borings to a minimum depth of seven feet shall be required by the board of health to determine if such conditions may interfere with installation, performance or repair of the proposed onsite sewage management system.
d.
Additional depth. Water table and rock borings shall be required at a minimum depth of 11 feet in areas with slopes greater than 20 percent.
e.
Negative evidence. Evidence of the presence of water or rock in the borings shall negate approval for present and future use of the area tested for installation of an onsite sewage management system.

Sec. 34-514. - Sewage flow.
The maximum anticipated daily sewage flow shall be determined from tables D and E, sewage flow schedule and maximum occupancy. Design flows for establishments not listed shall be determined by the board of health after review of data and design criteria submitted by the owner or his agent and shall be a minimum of three times the peak monthly water usage, if based on existing development water bills and if proposed and existing developments are the same size and use. Calculations shall be made on the basis of peak flow and ultimate usage of the facility. The maximum anticipated daily sewage flow of any of the above facilities other than food service establishments, taverns, bars and cocktail lounges shall be determined by multiplying the maximum occupancy (M.O.) (see table E) times the daily flow in gallons per individual or unit where applicable. For food establishments the minimum number of anticipated customers shall be calculated on a basis of two times the maximum occupancy times the number of meal services, i.e., minimum number of anticipated customers = 2 Ã M.O. Ã number of meal services. For taverns, bars and cocktail lounges the minimum number of anticipated customers shall be calculated on a basis of two times the maximum occupancy for the establishment, i.e., minimum number of anticipated customers = 2 Ã M.O. If the estimated number of customers, employees, etc., as indicated in the owner's letter of intent exceeds the calculated values, the higher number shall be used in determining the size of the onsite sewage management system.

(d)
Grease trap.
(1)
Required. Grease traps are required for all food service establishments and nonresidential kitchens where it is determined by the board of health that introduction of grease into the onsite system might adversely affect it. Grease traps are neither necessary nor recommended for onsite sewage management systems serving residences.
(2)
Design. Grease trap plans and specifications shall be submitted to the board of health for approval. No human waste shall pass through the grease trap. No grease trap shall have less than 750 gallons capacity and its effluent shall be directed to the septic tank. Grease traps shall be sized (minimum capacity) by multiplying three gallons times the maximum occupancy (see table E) times two for food service establishments. Grease trap size requirements for nonresidential kitchens shall be based on the maximum occupancy of the structure times three gallons.
(3)
Construction. Grease traps shall be located, installed and constructed so that the temperature of the sewage will be reduced to permit congealing or separation of grease and easy access for cleaning is provided. Construction shall be in accordance with the specifications and details in the current DHR Manual For On-Site Sewage Management Systems.
(e)
Sewage effluent pump. In the event that the sewage generated from a building or residence cannot be plumbed to an absorption field by gravity, then an onsite sewage management system may be modified by installing a sewage effluent pump (no sump pumps allowed) with the necessary appurtenances as determined by the board of health. Included but not limited to the following appurtenances are: a separate pump chamber from the septic tank, pump controls, level control switches, warning buzzer and/or light for power failure or pump malfunction, approved ventilation, manhole cover, check valve on discharge line, emergency bypass plumbing with absorption pit (20-ton minimum), piping, fittings and distribution box for pump discharge prior to entering absorption field.

(f)
Absorption pit. Absorption pits may not be utilized in any new construction with the following exceptions:
(1)
Washer pit. An adequately-sized absorption pit (20-ton minimum) may be constructed and placed to receive the greywater from a clothes washing machine only if permitted by the board of health.
(2)
Basement bathroom. In the event that a basement bathroom is proposed and there is not sufficient area for a conventional field and the bathroom cannot be plumbed by gravity into the main onsite sewage management system or a public or community sewerage system, an adequately sized absorption pit (20-ton minimum) may be constructed together with a septic tank if permitted by the board of health.
(3)
Emergency overflow. In the event that a sewage effluent pump is utilized in a residential or commercial onsite sewage management system, then an adequately sized absorption pit (20-ton minimum) shall be constructed and used for emergency overflow in case the pump malfunctions or electrical power is temporarily interrupted.
(4)
Size calculations. Absorption pits shall be sized in accordance with the following criteria:
a.
Residential. The volume of aggregate to be used in the absorption pit shall be equivalent to the corresponding amount used in a conventional absorption field trench per bedroom based on percolation rates as indicated in section 34-517, size of pit for a 450 square feet/bedroom rate (one bedroom only): 450 square feet Ã 1 foot (depth) Ã 100 pounds/c.f. 2,000 pounds/ton = 22.5 tons.
b.
Commercial. The volume of the absorption pit shall be calculated by multiplying the maximum anticipated daily sewage flow in gallons per day (see table D) times three. The volume in gallons shall be converted to cubic feet and tonnage of aggregate accordingly.
(5)
Design and construction. The minimum depth of an absorption pit shall be six feet with a minimum cover of 12 inches. A continuous layer of geotextile drainage fabric (building paper and straw not allowed) approved by the board of health, shall be placed over the aggregate along with a minimum 12-inch wide strip of aluminum foil along the entire perimeter of the pit before backfilling. The pipe entering the pit shall terminate downwards a minimum of 12 inches in the center of the pit for all pits except "in line" repair pits. The required (usable) volume of the pit shall be calculated based on the depth below the invert of the pipe times the area.

(Res. of 9-7-88(3), Â§ 30-2-7-11; Ord. No. 18-0340, Att. A, 5-16-18)
Sec. 34-517. - Absorption field.
(a)
Area computation. The determination of the absorption trench bottom area to be required shall be based upon both the maximum anticipated daily sewage flow from the proposed facility and upon the characteristics of the soil in which the absorption field is to be located. Soil characteristics shall include percolation rates determined in the manner set forth under section 34-513, together with types of soil encountered, drainage conditions and other related data that may be required by the board of health.
(1)
Residential lots. Trench bottom areas for residential onsite sewage management systems shall be not less than those shown below:
EXPAND
Average
Percolation
Test Rate
(minutes
per inch) Absorption
Trench Bottom
Area Per
Bedroom, Existing
or Proposed
(square feet)
1â45 300
46â65 375
66â90 450
  No additional trench area shall be required when an additional bathroom or wetbar is proposed if it is connected to the main onsite sewage management system. If a basement bathroom is proposed below the elevation of the main system, then a minimum 750-gallon septic tank and 300 square feet of absorption trench is required, actual trench area shall be based on percolation test rates. Split systems may require additional absorption trench area compared to a single system.
(2)
Commercial development. Total absorption trench bottom area for nonresidential onsite sewage management systems shall not be less than the area obtained by multiplying the maximum anticipated daily sewage flow (gallons) by the percolation coefficient, i.e., one-fifth of the square root of the average percolation rate, e.g., one-fifth times the square root of the percolation rate Ã gallons = total absorption trench bottom area. The maximum anticipated daily sewage flow shall be determined in accordance with the sewage flow schedule, table D of this article. The maximum total absorption trench bottom area for a nonresidential/commercial onsite sewage management system shall be 9,000 square feet. The minimum size nonresidential/commercial onsite sewage management system shall include at least a 750-gallon septic tank and 300 square feet of absorption trench bottom area.
(b)
Location. No absorption field shall be installed within the minimum separation distance indicated in table C from the referenced items, existing or proposed, nor in areas with unsuitable fill material. However, if fill section has been in existence for a minimum of ten years (appropriate documentation as required by the board of health) and normal compaction has taken place, then field lines may be allowed in the fill section based on satisfactory soils reports. A reduction in the minimum normal compaction timeframe (ten years) may be considered based on satisfactory lab tests and a favorable opinion from a soil scientist or soils engineer. If wells and onsite sewage management systems are in place on contiguous lots, 100 feet of separation shall be maintained between any well and any absorption field. Absorption fields shall not be installed in the floodplain nor where groundwater or adverse geological formations may interfere with the absorption of treated sewage or result in the contamination of groundwater. Absorption fields shall not be installed in areas subject to excessive surface water, ponding or runoff, including but not limited to stormwater and discharge from building gutters. Absorption fields shall not be installed where ground slopes exceed 20 percent, but sites with slopes exceeding 20 percent may be considered if investigations demonstrate that the slope limitation can be overcome by design or site modification (see details A and F). The board of health, after site inspection, may require greater separation distances due to adverse conditions such as topography, subsurface soil characteristics and/or groundwater sources. No part of the absorption field shall ever be covered by buildings, pavement or be used for vehicular traffic or parking.
(c)
Minimum design and construction. Absorption trenches shall be on grade throughout, constructed in minimum lengths (runs) of 50 linear feet, shall be no less than 30 nor more than 46 inches in depth, shall be at least 36 inches in width and shall enable placement of at least 12 inches of earth cover over distribution lines. If unfavorable soil conditions (high clay content, hard pan, etc.) are encountered at normal installation depths, trenches may be installed at greater depths if approved appropriate, site modifications are performed and acceptable percolation test rates can be shown to exist at these depths, and the soil meets all requirements for installation of absorption fields with respect to rock, groundwater elevations, etc. Absorption trenches shall be spaced not less than seven feet apart between trench walls nor closer than five feet to any septic tank. Perforated pipe shall be laid in the center of the trench with perforations oriented toward the bottom of the trench and appropriate fittings used where needed. Pipe crossings under roadways or paved areas shall not be considered in determining the total absorption trench bottom area. If an illegal trash pit is encountered during construction, then an absorption trench bypass must be installed in accordance with detail B meeting the approval of the board of health. Aggregate shall be placed under the absorption line to a minimum depth of six inches and shall extend the full width of the trench, and two inches of aggregate shall cover the absorption line (total depth of aggregate shall be a minimum of 12 inches). A continuous layer of approved geotextile drainage fabric (building paper and straw not allowed) shall be placed over the aggregate before backfilling to prevent siltation in the aggregate. A minimum 12-inch wide, continuous layer of aluminum foil shall be placed along the centerline of the absorption trench prior to backfilling to facilitate future location of the field line. Excavation for absorption trenches in wet clay soils and smearing of trench walls and bottoms shall be avoided so that permeability will not be reduced. Approvals may be withheld where such damage has occurred. Absorption fields shall not be installed in areas where percolation test rates exceed 90 minutes per inch.
(1)
Vertical piping. Additional vertical piping may be installed (and required as necessary) in the absorption trenches, connected to the distribution lines and specifically located at the highest elevated portion of each trench to accommodate periodic addition of oxidizing agents to facilitate maintenance of the system. Vertical pipes shall not extend more than six inches above the ground surface (finished grade) and shall be capped to minimize rainfall infiltration and vandalism.
(d)
Field layout methods. Absorption fields shall be designed and installed in accordance with one of the following methods:
(1)
Distribution box method. The distribution box method may be used on level or moderately sloping topography. This method is required for all systems using dosing tanks and sewage effluent pumps. A level reinforced concrete foundation (minimum four-inch thick slab) shall be provided for approved precast distribution boxes to ensure against tilting. It shall extend a minimum of six inches beyond the box in both dimensions. Extreme care must be exercised in backfilling around and over the distribution box. There shall be no less than 12 inches nor more than 24 inches of cover over the box. Influent lines from the septic tank, dosing tank or pump chamber shall terminate inside the distribution box via an elbow turned downward to form a submerged inlet at normal water level. Equal absorption trench areas, not exceeding 600 square feet, shall be connected to distribution box outlets by independent sewers. A combination of standard and modified absorption trenches may be installed if prior approval is given by the board of health. While such absorption trenches may be installed at the same or different elevations, all lines (two or more lines required) leading from the distribution box to absorption trenches shall be schedule 40 PVC; installed level, on a solid bed of aggregate (12 inches minimum width) and at the same elevation for the initial two feet; shall be watertight and, for the remainder of the sealed length, minimum grade shall be one-eighth inch per foot. All perforated distribution lines shall be laid on a uniform grade with no more than four inches of fall per 100 linear feet of absorption trench.
(2)
Level field method. The level field method may be used only on flat terrain. When this method is used, all absorption field trenches shall be installed level and at the same elevation, shall not exceed 100 linear feet in length and shall be connected at the ends to form a continuous system. A combination of standard and modified absorption trenches may be installed if prior approval is given by the board of health. A standard tee fitting or a distribution box shall be used to distribute treated sewage, shall be not less than five feet from the septic tank, and shall have an invert at least four inches below the septic tank outlet invert. A standard tee fitting shall be used to effect a juncture of the ends of any three distribution lines.
(3)
Serial distribution method. The serial distribution method may be used in areas with sloping topography. Absorption trenches shall be constructed level (maximum four inches of fall per 100 linear feet) and shall follow contours. A combination of standard and modified absorption trenches may be installed if prior approval is given by the board of health. All effluent from the septic tank must traverse the uppermost distribution line before entering overflow sewers (solid line) and the system must be constructed so that each trench is filled with effluent to the full depth of aggregate before it enters succeeding trenches via overflow connections. Overflow sewer connections shall be required only when there is an overall change in trench bottom elevations. The invert of the first overflow sewer must be at least four inches below the invert of the septic tank outlet. At the point where an overflow sewer connects absorption trenches, the invert of the overflow sewer shall be no deeper than the top of the aggregate in the preceding absorption trench, so that an undisturbed block of earth will remain in place for the full depth of the aggregate. Overflow sewers connecting absorption trenches shall be laid on undisturbed earth. Care must be exercised in backfilling over the overflow sewer to prevent damage and there shall be a minimum of 12 inches of earth cover over the sewers.
(4)
Modified serial/level method. The modified serial/level method may be used in areas with gentle sloping topography only if specifically approved by the board of health. All construction specifications and requirements are the same as those for the serial distribution and level field methods except:
a.
Lengths of "feeder line" trenches may vary throughout the system.
b.
Ends of "feeder line" trenches should be connected to ends of other "feeder line" trenches whenever possible and as directed by the board of health.
c.
"Feeder line" trenches branching off the main distribution line trench shall be connected with standard tee fittings.
d.
Portions of the modified system may be installed via the level field method and connected to other portions of the modified system installed via the serial distribution method. See detail C for more information.
(e)
Modified absorption trenchâDouble side. A variation of the standard absorption trench may be utilized only with board of health approval on lots where the available area to install the absorption field is limited, thus necessitating placement of two standard distribution lines in one absorption trench. The trench width shall be six feet with the distribution lines spaced on a two-foot center with two feet of trench width on either side of the lines. All other construction specifications shall be in accordance with this article. This modified absorption trench will be specifically used for repairs and in initial installations where space is limited to maintain the reserve area.
(f)
Modified absorption trenchâDeep percolation. Where the available area to install the absorption trench has unsatisfactory percolation test results at the normal installation depths (30 inches to 48 inches), a variation of the standard absorption trench may be utilized if approved by the board of health. The modified trench depth shall be equal to the depth at which satisfactory percolation test results were obtained. The invert (bottom) of the distribution line shall be no deeper than 42 inches. Placement of aggregate shall be below the invert of the distribution line to the bottom of the trench and shall extend to a height of two inches above the top of the distribution line (minimum 12 inches depth of aggregate). All other construction specifications are in accordance with this article, specifically this section and detail E.
(g)
Modified absorption trenchâSteep slope. Where the available area to install the absorption trench has a ground surface slope exceeding 20 percent and it is impractical or undesirable for the owner to modify the site (benching or terracing) to accommodate a conventional absorption trench a variation of the standard absorption trench may be utilized if approved by the board of health. The modified trench shall be extended to a depth of 66 inches with the invert (bottom) of the distribution line installed at a depth of 60 inches. Aggregate shall be placed from six inches below the distribution line to two inches above the top of the distribution line, total depth of aggregate being 12 inches. Vent stacks (constructed with solid four inches PVC, schedule 40) shall be connected to the distribution line with tees and shall extend no less than six inches above finished grade. Vent stacks shall be installed at 50-foot intervals along the entire length of the system. They may be hooded with ventilated caps (optional) to minimize rainfall infiltration and vandalism. Initial installation of the stacks shall be accomplished to leave at least three to four feet above the ground surface (staked and flagged) for ease of identification and minimize destruction and possible removal or lowering of the vents during final grading and landscaping. Tops of stacks shall be lowered only after all construction is completed. All other construction specifications must be in accordance with this article, specifically this section and detail F.
