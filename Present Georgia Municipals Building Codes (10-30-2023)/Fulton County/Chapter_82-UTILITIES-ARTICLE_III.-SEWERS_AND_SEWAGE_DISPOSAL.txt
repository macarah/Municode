Local Constitutional Amendments and Local Acts reference—Authority to provide sewer service, § 1-114.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 82-106. - Purpose of article.
The purpose of this article is to ensure adequate public facilities are available to serve new growth and development in Fulton County and to regulate the use and development of land so that new growth and development bears a proportionate share of the cost of new public facilities needed to serve new growth and development.
(92-RC-527, art. II, § 2, 11-18-92; Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-107. - Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, the following words and terms are defined:
Building drain means that part of the lowest horizontal piping of a drainage system which receives the discharge from drainage pipes located inside the walls of the building and conveys it to the building sewer or sewer service lateral, beginning five feet (1.5 meters) outside the inner face of the building wall.
Building sewer or sewer service lateral means the extension from the building drain to the public (county) sewer.
Capacity is a measure of the sewage carrying ability of given components of the sewerage system and is the maximum flow of sewage, measured in gallons per day, that can be safely and efficiently transported.
Line capacity means the maximum quantity of sewage in a given segment of sewer line for a given time period at a minimum slope and maximum depth of flow.
System capacity means the capacity of a given sewerage system of pumps, pipelines and appurtenances.
Development generating sewage flow means any additional flow of sewage into the sewerage system resulting from construction, expansion, change in use of a building or structure, or any change in the use of land.
Direct improvements are always project improvements, not system improvements. Direct improvements include, but are not limited to, any sewers and lines, or any portion thereof, exclusively destined for a development generating sewage flow.
Excess capacity means that proportion of the capacity of a given sewer line segment or sewerage system which is beyond that necessary to provide a specified level of service insofar as such excess is not a result of engineering design factors such as prudent safety margins or functions of standard material sizes.
Impact means the effect of additional sewage flow on a sewer system in a given basin or service area.
Level of service is a measure of the relationship between capacity and service demand expressed in terms of demand to capacity ratios or the comfort and convenience of use or both. More specifically for sewers, level of service is a qualitative measure describing the collective factors of sewer line segment or sewerage system capacity, service demand, depth of flow, overflow conditions and operating costs for specified service conditions.
Project improvements means site improvements and facilities that are planned and designed to provide service for a particular development project and that are necessary for the use and convenience of the occupants or users of the project and that are not system improvements. The character of the improvement shall determine whether an improvement is a project improvement or a system improvement and the physical location of the improvement onsite or offsite shall not be considered determinative of whether an improvement is a project improvement or a system improvement. If an improvement or facility provides or will provide more than incidental service or capacity to persons other than users or occupants of a particular project, the improvement or facility is a system improvement and shall not be considered a project improvement. No improvement or facility included in a plan for public facilities approved by the Fulton County Board of Commissioners shall be considered a project improvement.
Proportionate share means that portion of the cost of improvements which is reasonably related to the service demands and needs of the project.
Sanitary sewer means a sewer which carries sewage and to which storm water, surface water and groundwater are not intentionally admitted.
Sewage means a combination of the water-carried wastes from residences, business buildings, institutions and industrial establishments, together with such groundwater, surface water and storm water as may be present.
Sewage works means all facilities for collecting, pumping, treating and disposing of sewage.
Sewerage system means a combination of methods for collecting and transporting untreated wastewater, from its source of generation to a sewage treatment plant. This includes street sewers (which collect sewage from building sewers or sewer service laterals), outfalls which collect sewage from the street sewers and interceptors or main collector sewers which collect sewage from outfalls and lead directly to the treatment plant.
Sewerage improvements means the improvements to system of pipes, pumps, and facilities necessary to provide collection, treatment and disposal of sanitary sewage. The improvements include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1)
Rights-of-way and easements;
(2)
Collection sewer mains;
(3)
Outfall, interceptor, and relief sewers;
(4)
Pumping and discharge stations;
(5)
Wastewater treatment facilities; and
(6)
Sludge handling systems.
System expansion means those capital improvements which expand the capacity of a system to carry and/or treat additional sewage flows.
System extension means those capital improvements which extend a system to new geographic areas, but do not necessarily expand capacity to carry and/or treat additional sewage flows. Any sewerage system extension or portion thereof which provides capacity only for the development to which it is being extended is considered a project improvement not a system improvement; only that proportion of a sewerage system extension which provides excess capacity beyond that required by the development to which the extension is made is not a project improvement.
System improvements means capital improvements that are public facilities designed to provide service to the community at large, in contrast to project improvements.
System improvement costs mean costs incurred to provide additional sewerage system capacity needed to serve new growth and development associated with planning, design, engineering, construction, land acquisition and land improvement. Specifically, costs include, but are not limited to, the construction contract price, surveying, engineering fees, related land acquisition costs including land purchases, court awards and costs, attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, expenses incurred for qualified staff or any qualified engineer, planner, architect, landscape architect, or financial consultant for preparing or updating the capital improvement element, and administrative costs, provided that such administrative costs shall not exceed three percent of the total amount of the costs. Projected interest charges and other finance costs may be included if the fees are to be used for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, notes, or other financial obligations issued by or on behalf of Fulton County to finance the capital improvements element, but such costs do not include routine and periodic maintenance expenditures, personnel training, and other operating costs.

Sec. 82-187. - Basis for extension; petition or request; intent of article.
The Fulton County Sewerage System may be extended to serve existing development upon petition of property owners or upon request by an authorized agent of the county due to a public health emergency. Additionally, the sewerage system may be extended to serve new private development sites at the request of developers. Sewer system extension is, prima facie, a project improvement, as defined herein, and is ultimately a financial responsibility of developers and property owners. The intent of this article is that developers and/or property owners bear a proportionate share of the cost of any sewerage system extensions needed to serve a development. Sewerage extension fees shall be determined by using one of the methods in section 82-188 or section 82-189.
(92-RC-527, art. VII, 11-18-92; Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-188. - Extension to existing development.
(a)
Petition sewer. On any given street segment, the owners of more than 50 percent of the road frontage of existing residential property may petition the board of commissioners for installation of a sewer system extension to serve such properties. Upon installation of such sewer, all abutting property owners shall be assessed a proportionate share of the cost of such installation.
(1)
The costs to be borne by the property owners is associated strictly with installing system capacity to serve those property owners and does not include any additional costs that may be associated with the provision of excess capacity for future development. The proportionate share of the cost to be borne by each property owner is based on its relative sewage flow contribution and proportionate length of system extension attributable to that property.
a.
The sewage flow contribution of each property is estimated using standard engineering practices and methods applied by the Fulton County Department of Public Works.
b.
If, in the event a sewerage system extension is designed, at the county's request, to provide excess capacity for the purpose of providing service to additional development in the future, then the Fulton County Sewerage System shall pay, with cash or in-kind contribution, the proportionate share of the cost of the excess capacity, such cost to be reimbursed to the county on a proportionate basis as new development enters the system.
(2)
Whenever a petition for installation of a sewer extension has been presented to the board of commissioners by owners of existing residential property, the county manager or the manager's designee shall:
a.
Set a date for a public hearing thereon before the board of commissioners.
b.
Give notice of the petition and date of the hearing to all persons concerned through publication of a notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing and a general description of the proposed sewer extension location and cost. Such notice shall be published in a newspaper of general location circulation or in the newspaper wherein the sheriffs notices are published. Such notice shall be published at least ten days prior to the date set for the hearing.
c.
Give notice, in writing, by regular mail, to all property owners of property abutting said sewer line against which the cost of installation is to be assessed, notice of the time and place of the hearing, and a general description of the proposed sewer extension location and cost. Such notice shall be posted at least ten days prior to the date set for the hearing. Such notice shall be addressed to the person whose name appears on the last tax digest as the owner thereof and sent to the address listed in the tax digest.
(3)
At the hearing, any person whose property or interest is affected by the proposed sewer may in person or through an agent or attorney, object to or support the proposed sewer extension.
(4)
The decision of the board of commissioners regarding approval or rejection of the proposed sewer extension shall be final and conclusive and is also final and conclusive regarding the public necessity for construction of the sewer and the assessment of cost against abutting property owners.
(b)
Public health. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, an authorized representative of the county may request of the board of commissioners installation of a sewer system extension. Such request must be accompanied by evidence that a situation immediately adverse to the public health exists and that such situation will be alleviated by installation and use of the proposed sewer system extension.
(1)
Upon approval by the board of commissioners, such sewer system extension shall be installed immediately.
(2)
All property abutting such sewer system extension shall be assessed a proportionate share of the cost of installation.
(3)
The costs to be borne by the property owner is associated strictly with installing system capacity to service those property owners and does not include any additional costs that may be associated with the provision of excess capacity for future development. The proportionate share of the cost to be borne by each property owner is based on its relative sewage flow contribution and proportionate length of system extension attributable to that property.
a.
The sewage flow contribution of each property is estimated using standard engineering practices and methods applied by the Fulton County Department of Public Works.
b.
If, in the event a sewerage system extension is designed to provide excess capacity for the purpose of providing service to additional development in the future, then the Fulton County Sewerage System shall pay the proportionate share of the cost of the excess capacity, with cash or in-kind contribution, such cost to be reimbursed to the county on a proportionate basis as new development enters the system.
(c)
Assessments; petition sewers and installations for reasons of public health. Whenever a petition sewer extension has been installed or whenever a sewer system extension has been installed for reasons of public health, the county manager or the manager's designee shall prepare an assessment roll. Such assessment roll shall describe the system extension and show the abutting property, the existing use (or if undeveloped, the permitted use) of the abutting property, and the names of the owners of the abutting property. All abutting property on both sides of the street shall be assessed a proportional share of the cost of installation as set forth herein.
(1)
The assessment role as prepared by the county manager or the manager's designee shall be presented to the board of commissioners at a regular or called meeting and adopted and spread on the minutes of the commission.
(2)
All assessments against property and the owners thereof for the construction of sewer system extensions installed as petition sewers or for reasons of public health shall be liens upon the property from the date of the adoption of an action of the board of commissioners authorizing construction of said sewer system extension.
(3)
The county manager or the manager's designee shall prepare and keep an improvement register which records all assessments against properties for sewer system extensions installed as petition sewers or for reasons of public health. Such register shall be updated immediately upon passage of authorization for sewer system extension construction by the board of commissioners. The register shall describe the sewer system extension to be built and the properties affected.
(4)
All properties served shall be assessed a proportionate share of the cost of the extension based on relative sewage flow contributions and proportionate share of the length of extension as described in the remainder of this section.
(5)
Whenever a sewer system extension abuts a tract of land other than a corner property on more than one side and when said tract is incapable of subdivision because of zoning regulations, building code restrictions, topography, or other reasons, said property shall be assessed only on the side having the greater frontage.
(6)
Corner property shall be assessed as follows:
a.
Where the sewer system extension line abuts corner property only on the front, the property shall be assessed for the amount of frontage.
b.
Where the sewer system extension line abuts corner property on both the front and a side, the property shall be assessed for the frontage; and:
1.
The first 150 feet of each side abutting a line shall be exempted from assessment.
2.
The next 100 feet of each side abutting a line shall be subject to assessment.
c.
Where the sewer system extension line abuts corner property only on a side, the property shall be assessed for the frontage and:
1.
The first 150 feet of each side abutting a line shall be exempted from assessment.
2.
The next 100 feet of each side abutting a line shall be subject to assessment.
d.
Where the sewer system extension line abuts property, but does not abut such property on any street, the property shall be assessed for its street frontage.
e.
Whenever property has been exempted from assessment for abutting sewers under the terms of this article and the condition of the property or improvements is later changed so that the owner requests a sewer connection be granted, the owner shall be required to pay the amount said property would have been assessed had there been no exemption, but at rates prevailing at the time the connection is granted.
(7)
Whenever a sewer line has been constructed in accordance with the sections and the cost thereof assessed against the property benefiting thereby and the owners thereof, said owners shall be notified of such assessment and the amount thereof.
a.
Within 60 days after the date of the assessment, such property owner shall pay the amount of such assessment in full or, upon request, such property owner shall be allowed to elect an installment payment plan.
b.
If the installment payment plan is elected, the owner shall pay not less than one-fourth of the total assessment in cash within said 60 days and execute and deliver therewith the necessary documents hereafter specified to document and evidence such plan and the assessment lien on the property.
c.
The remainder of the assessment, after deduction of such cash payment, may, upon the request of the property owner, be divided into not more than three equal annual installments, maturing one, two and three years, respectively, from the date of said assessment, provided proper evidence of such extension shall be executed by the owner of the property, and the unpaid balance shall bear interest from the date of the assessment of the cost until paid at the rate of interest thus being charged on unpaid state and county taxes. Said evidence of indebtedness shall be negotiable in form, and Fulton County shall reserve the right therein to transfer and assign the same to third parties.
d.
No extension of time for the payment of any assessment shall affect the validity of said assessment or the right of Fulton County, or its assignee, to proceed to enforce the same against said property and the owner thereof. In case of default in any installment, the entire assessment shall become due and payable forthwith.
e.
Whenever the owner of any property desires to extend the payment of all or any part of any assessment levied against him or his property as provided in the preceding sections, at the time of the application for such extension and the execution of evidences thereof, such owner shall likewise execute an acknowledgement of the lien upon his property for the sewer assessment against the same, which acknowledgement shall be upon a form provided by the county of such nature that it may be recorded and which shall be recorded on the deed records of Fulton County in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court.
f.
Should the owner of any property against which assessment for sewers has been levied fail either to execute the instruments required for an extension, as provided in the preceding sections, or to pay same in cash within 60 days of the due date, execution shall issue forthwith against the property improved and the owner thereof.
g.
Assessments against property and the owners thereof for the construction of sewer line and charges made for connection of sewer line shall be paid to the Department of Finance of Fulton County covering the same.
h.
Whenever the owner of any property shall fail to pay any sewer assessment or extension thereof when the same shall become due, the holder of such evidence, whether the holder is Fulton County or its assignee, shall be entitled to have an execution issued therefore, which execution shall issue in the name of the board of commissioners, be signed by the chairman of the board and be recorded on the general execution docket in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County. Said execution shall be issued in rem against the property described in the assessment roll and in personam against the owner thereof, and shall include in addition to principal and interest a fee for the issuance of the same as may be established from time to time by the board of commissioners. Subsequent costs thereon shall be the same as those now allowed by law to the sheriff for the performance of similar services. All adjoining property owned by the same party or parties shall be covered in any execution issued and only one such execution shall be issued against any property owner covering adjacent lots.
i.
All executions for sewer assessment shall be handed to the Sheriff of Fulton County and subsequent proceedings had thereon shall be as provided by law for the enforcement of execution of taxes.

Sec. 82-189. - Extension to new development.
(a)
Responsibility of developer. Any sewerage improvement, extension, and/or expansion, or portion thereof, which is a project improvement is the sole responsibility of the developer.
(1)
In the event the county requires sewerage system extensions to be built with excess capacity so that additional anticipated development in the geographic area accessed by the extensions may be served by the extensions presently or in the future, then the developer is ultimately liable only for the proportionate share of the cost of the sewer extension attributable to the sewage flow contribution (estimated using standard engineering practices and methods applied by the Fulton County Department of Public Works) of the development compared to the capacity of the extension and length of pipe required to reach the development as compared to total length of pipe constructed.
(2)
The County must provide credits, in accord with the construction and intent of section 88-19 of the Fulton County Development Impact Fee Ordinance (incorporated herein by reference), to the developer for provision of excess capacity or directly compensate the developer for the proportionate cost of the excess capacity.
(3)
Sewerage extension project improvements must:
a.
Be submitted for review and approval at or prior to the time a land disturbance permit is requested.
b.
Be designed with a minimum capacity to serve the entire project as defined in zoning petitions and/or approved subdivisions, as opposed to phases of such project.
(4)
Installation of such project improvements may not proceed until:
a.
The developer has received all required reviews and permits from the county.
b.
The developer has paid any fees which may be required under other parts of this article and any other applicable ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation of Fulton County.
c.
The developer has agreed to dedicate or otherwise provide all necessary easements, rights of access, and other necessary property rights associated with the project improvement to the county.
(b)
Developer requests. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a developer may request permission, and the county may grant permission, to install sewer extensions to a site at the expense of the developer.
(1)
If a developer seeks to install a sewer extension to a development and such extension, for whatever reason, can serve only that site, the developer must bear the entire cost of such extension by, at the developer's option, either:
a.
Causing the extension to be installed using the developer's own means and funds; or
b.
Paying to the county, before commencement of actual construction, an amount the county has established by contract to be the cost of sewer extension installation.
(2)
If a developer seeks to install a sewer extension to a development and the county requires such extension to be built with excess capacity so that additional anticipated development in the geographic area accessed by the extension may be served by the extension presently or in the future, then the developer is ultimately liable for the proportionate share of the cost of the sewer extension attributable to the sewage flow contribution (estimated using standard engineering practices and methods applied by the Fulton County Department of Public Works) of the development compared to the capacity of the extension. In this event, at the developer's option, either:
a.
The developer may cause the extension to be installed using his/her own means and funds; or
b.
The developer may pay to the county, before commencement of actual construction, an amount the county has established by contract to be the cost of sewer extension installation.
c.
In either case, the county shall:
1.
Accept and record the developer's cost of sewer extension installation and reimburse the developer or his/her successors in title the proportionate cost of the excess capacity as it is taken up and paid for by additional development using the extension;
2.
At the county's option, the county may participate with the developer in providing excess capacity by providing materials necessary for the excess capacity; or
3.
At the county's option, the county may, upon completion of construction, reimburse the developer for the proportionate share of unused capacity, calculated using the methodology described above, maintain records of the actual cost of installation, and reimburse itself the cost of excess capacity taken up and paid for by additional development using the extension.
(3)
A developer may request the county and the county may, at its option and using its own resources, install sewer extensions to a site. Using records of actual direct and indirect cost to the county of individual extension installations, the county will charge any developer, including a developer initiating an original request for installation of a sewer system extension, a proportionate share, using methodology described above, of the actual cost of sewer system extension installation.
(4)
A developer may request, and the county may grant, permission to use unused excess capacity in an existing sewerage system extension to meet the sewage flow contribution of a planned development. In this event, the county shall charge a fee calculated on the basis of the proportionate share of the cost of the sewer extension attributable to the sewage flow contribution of the development compared to the line segment capacity flow rate of the extension and length of pipe required to reach the development site.
a.
In the event the county has records that may be used to determine the actual cost of installation of the specific system extension requested for use, the cost of the proportionate share (adjusted to present value) shall be based on that actual cost of installation.
b.
In the event adequate records reflecting actual cost of installation of a specific system extension are not available, the average unit cost of installation of similar system extensions from the previous fiscal year (adjusted to present value) shall be used as the cost basis of calculating proportionate share.
c.
For the purposes cited above, present value shall be calculated using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent).
(92-RC-527, art. VII, § 2, 11-18-92; Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-190. - Fee rate schedules.
(a)
The fee rate schedules are developed and administratively adopted from the department of public works. Such schedules shall be based on the best estimates available to the department of public works of average sewage flow contribution generated by various land uses and shall be used to directly calculate fees and charges.
(b)
If there is an application to provide a sewer to a type of land use not included in the fee rate schedule, the county manager shall cause a fee to be established, based on flow generation rates found acceptable by the county.
(c)
Whenever sewerage extension fees are based upon an assumed discharge flow, either the county, at its option, or the developer, at its option, may recalculate the fee based on actual water usage or measured sewer discharge after six months of actual experience. In this event, the owner shall be entitled to receive as a refund, or shall be required to pay as an additional charge, the difference between the initial charge as estimated by the county and the recalculated charge based on actual usage.
(92-RC-527, art. VIII, §§ 1—3, 11-18-92; Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-191. - Individual sewer extension assessment determination.
(a)
In the event that an applicant for sewer system extension, or an applicant for use of excess extension capacity, under the provisions of this article elects, an individual sewer extension assessment determination may be requested. If it is found that the data, information, and assumptions used by the applicant to calculate the individual sewer assessment determination satisfy the requirements of section 58-173 of this Code (incorporated herein by reference) and the requirements of this section, the individual sewer extension assessment determination shall be deemed the sewerage extension fee due and owing for the proposed development.
(b)
In addition to meeting the requirements of section 58-173 (incorporated herein by reference), the applicant shall show the basis of the individual sewer extension assessment determination including, but not limited to, the following:
(1)
Sewer engineering studies including documentation of sewage flow generation rates appropriate to the specific development activity proposed.
(2)
Sewer engineering studies including documentation of the line capacity of the sewer system extension proposed for installation and the proportionate share of that capacity used by the development.
(3)
If applicable, sewer engineering studies used to calculate the extent to which an individual sewer line is used as a system extension as opposed to a system expansion (designed to provide excess capacity for the purpose of providing service to additional development in the future) for the purpose of establishing an attribution for base cost of the system extension, the proportionate share of which will serve as a basis for fees.
(c)
All documentation shall be prepared and presented by qualified professionals registered to practice in their respective fields and shall follow best professional practices and methodologies.
(d)
A developer may request a preapplication conference with the county manager or the manager's designee.
(e)
The county manager or the manager's designee shall provide the developer with an independent fee determination within 30 working days of the formal submittal of a complete application for an individual assessment determination, including an individual assessment study.
(f)
All other requirements being met, nothing in this article shall prevent a developer from receiving a building permit upon payment of fees as required and calculated herein and proceeding while awaiting an individual fee assessment determination. When an individual fee assessment is established, any excess payments shall be refunded.
(92-RC-527, art. IX, §§ 1—6, 11-18-92; Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-192. - Private agreements.
(a)
In accord with the general provisions of section 58-177 of this Code, and the more specific provisions of this section, any applicant or group of applicants may propose to enter into a private agreement with the county designed to establish proportional share system improvements appropriate to the circumstances of the specific development or developments proposed.
(b)
Such an agreement may include, but shall not be limited to, provisions which:
(1)
Modify calculations of sewage generation set forth herein and provide a fee which may differ from that set forth in this article by specifying the nature of the proposed development for purposes of computing actual sewage generation, provided that the agreement shall establish legally enforceable means for ensuring that the actual sewage generated will not exceed the agreed upon estimated sewage generated by the development.
a.
The agreement must contain language acceptable to the county manager or the manager's designee showing that the assumptions made for sewage generation will be met. Further, language must be included in the agreement to allow the county to assess additional fees if, two years after the completion of construction, the development has not, in fact, met the reduced assumptions of sewage generation and/or if, five years following the completion of construction the development has not, in fact, maintained such reduced sewage generation.
b.
The agreement must also contain language requiring the developer to report to the county manager or the manager's designee the status of the project relative to assumptions of reduced sewage generation on the second and fifth anniversaries of the completion of construction. Figures to be reported shall include both actual sewage generation figures and sewage generation as a factor of the project's occupancy rate. Failure to report may result in assessment of additional fees.
(2)
Permit the construction of specific sewer system improvements in lieu of or with a credit against the sewer fee assessable.
(3)
Permit a schedule and method for the payment of fees in a manner appropriate to the particular and unique circumstances of the proposed development in lieu of other requirements for payment set forth herein, provided that security is posted ensuring payment of the fees, in a form acceptable to the county, which security may be in the form of a cash bond, surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, negotiable certificate of deposit or escrow account, or lien or mortgage on lands to be covered by the building permit.
(4)
Permit the substitution of sewer system related projects in lieu of or with a credit against the sewerage extension fee assessable.
a.
Dedication and use of land application sewage treatment sites.
b.
Dedication of land for use by other sewer related facilities.
(92-RC-527, art. X, §§ 1, 2, 11-18-92; Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-193. - Use of public sewers.

(e)
Sewer service to adjacent, unincorporated areas. Any user of Fulton County's Wastewater Collection and Treatment System who is located in an unincorporated area adjacent to Fulton County will be subject to the provisions and requirements of this article.
(Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06; Ord. No. 18-0340, Att. A, 5-16-18)
Sec. 82-194. - Private sewage disposal.
(a)
Except as provided in this section, the construction, installation, or operation of central on-site sewage management systems is prohibited for residential developments. Central on-site sewage management may be permitted, where public sewer is not available, if the Fulton County Board of Health or the Georgia Environmental Protection Division approves a permit.
(1)
In addition to the private sewage disposal system, a sewerage collection and conveyance system shall be designed pursuant to the current Fulton County standards.
(2)
All related permanent and construction easements shall be dedicated to Fulton County.
(3)
The sewer system design and easements shall include an outfall to the furthest downstream point of the development property.
(4)
Fulton County accepts no responsibility for private on-site sewerage disposal systems.
(b)
Applications, permits. When a public sanitary sewer is not available, building sewers shall be connected to private onsite sewage management systems subject to board of health approval and the following considerations:
(1)
Applications for permits to construct, repair, alter, enlarge and/or use privies, privy vaults, cesspools, aeration systems and septic tanks shall be referred to the Fulton County Board of Health. The owners shall operate and maintain the private wastewater disposal system in a sanitary manner at all times in accordance with the conditions of the operating permit, at no expense to the county. Such facilities shall be subject to inspection by the board of health at reasonable times. The type, capacities, location and layout of a private wastewater disposal system shall comply with all requirements of the Fulton County Board of Health or applicable state or federal laws. No permit shall be issued for any private wastewater disposal systems employing subsurface soil disposal where the lot area is less than the minimum requirements enforced by the board of health.
(c)
Septic tank hauler. It shall be unlawful for a private septic tank pumpout hauler to deposit sewage in a manhole or other point of discharge in the sewage works without approval of the point of discharge and payment of fees as established by the county.
(d)
Discharge to stream. It shall be unlawful for any commercial or industrial facility to discharge any pollutants such as mud, sand, screenings or wastes from any washing operations directly to a receiving stream without prior approval from the county. This shall include erosion and stormwater flows of muddy water leaving the site of a construction project which may lead to appreciable siltation and/or adverse affects to downstream water users.
(e)
Requirements of other authorities. No requirement contained in this article shall be construed to relieve the applicant of any additional requirements that may be imposed by other authorities having legal jurisdiction.
(Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06; Ord. No. 18-0340, Att. A, 5-16-18)
Sec. 82-195. - Sewer service laterals (building sewers) and connections.
(a)
Permit required. No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections to, or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer, or appurtenances thereof, without first obtaining a written permit from the county. No connection shall be made except at a connection point approved by the county. If no connection is available, then one shall be provided by the county upon payment of the full construction cost by the applicant.
(b)
Three classes of permits. There shall be three classes of building sewer permits, for (a) residential services, (b) commercial service, and (c) service to establishments producing industrial wastes. In any case, the owner or his agent shall make application on forms furnished by the county. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the county and shall be accompanied by the necessary connection fees required by the Fulton County Sewer Charge Resolution. Approval of the permit required by this section shall not be deemed to approve of nor authorize anything not stated in the application.
(c)
Responsibility for installation and maintenance costs. All costs and expense incidental to the installation and connection of the building sewer or sewer service lateral shall be borne by the owner. The building sewers or sewer service laterals up to the connection to the public sewer are the responsibility of the property owner and are not part of the sewerage system operated and maintained by the county. If there is a cleanout installed on the service lateral at the edge of the public right-of-way or county easement, under emergency conditions where public health or safety may be jeopardized, the county may assist property owners, at the owner's expense, with maintaining that portion of the service lateral between the county sewer and the cleanout. Repairs to the service lateral within the public right-of-way or county easement shall be undertaken by the county or an approved contractor and the cost shall be borne by the owner. In no way does the maintenance or repair assistance by the county exercise dominion or control of the sewer service lateral.
(d)
Multiple connections through one service lateral. A separate and independent service lateral shall be provided for every building, except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available nor can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the service lateral from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one service lateral. In cases where there are unauthorized multiple connections to a single service lateral, the county accepts no responsibility for rectifying this problem. The cost of providing separate connections in such cases must be borne by the affected property owner(s).
(e)
Use of old service laterals. Old building sewers or sewer service laterals may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, upon examination and test by the county, to meet all requirements of this article.
(f)
Compliance with other regulations; joints to be tight. The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction, the methods used in excavating, placing the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench for building sewers shall all conform to the building code, plumbing code, current county developmental standards and all other regulations of the county. In cases of conflict and in absence of other provisions, materials and procedures set forth in ASCE-WPCF manual of practice number 9 shall govern. All joints of the building sewer shall be tight and waterproof.
(g)
Elevation; artificial lifting. Whenever possible, the service lateral shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be mechanically lifted and discharged to the sewer service lateral.
(h)
Connecting unpolluted wastes. No person shall make any connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains or other sources of surface runoff, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted industrial process waters to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected, directly or indirectly, to a public sanitary sewer.
(i)
Connection of service lateral to county sewer. The connection of the sewer service lateral into the county sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing codes, current county developmental standards and other applicable rules and regulations of the county. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the county before installation.
(j)
Notice, inspection, supervision of sewer service lateral construction. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the county when the sewer service lateral is ready for inspection and connection to the county sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the county.
(k)
Protection of excavations; restoration of public property. All excavations for sewer service lateral installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the county. Construction shall comply with the provisions of PL 91-596, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.
