c.
Generators of scrap tires shall maintain copies of completed manifest records for three years.
d.
Unless otherwise approved in writing by EPD, generators shall assure that any person collecting and transporting their scrap tires hold a valid scrap tire carrier permit issued by the EPD, provided, however, that a person who generates less than 100 tires per month and who transport only their own scrap tires to approved end users, processors, recyclers, or disposers are not required to have a scrap tire carrier permit, but must comply with all other provisions required of generators and scrap tire carriers.
e.
A generator shall report to the EPD any carrier who fails to return a properly completed manifest to the generator within 30 days of scrap tire pickup as provided for in paragraph (3)e. of this rule. Such report shall be filed within 30 days of failure of the carrier to comply.
f.
Generators may choose to determine whether a tire, because of wear, damage, or defect, is not suitable for classification as a "used tire," or "retreadable casing" as defined in this article. However, if a generator fails to sort or delineate which tires are "used," "retreadable casings," or "scrap tires," then all tires transported shall be considered scrap tires and must be thusly indicated on the shipment manifest.
(3)
Scrap tire carriers enforcement.
a.
The county will inspect scrap tire carriers to determine if the entity collecting or transporting scrap tires has been issued a scrap tire carrier permit and proper financial assurances.
b.

1.
Employed as an ingredient (including use as an intermediate) in a process to make a product (for example, utilizing crumb rubber to make rubber-asphalt). The county may encourage the use of crumb rubber modified asphalt in future contracts in which the county funds surface transportation improvements including, paving of new roads, resurfacing existing roads or both, if it is determined to be cost effective. In addition, the county may require the use of crumb rubber modified asphalt in future projects constructed without county funding participation;
2.
Employed in a particular function or application as an effective substitute for a commercial product (for example, utilizing shredded tires as a substitute for fuel oil, natural gas, coal, or wood in a boiler or industrial furnace) as long as such substitution does not pose a threat to human health or the environment, and so long as the facility is not a solid waste thermal treatment technology facility or utilizing shredded tires as a soil amendment, aggregate, etc.; and
3.
Reused for its original intended purpose as a used tire or reused for other purposes approved by the EPD, such as playground equipment, offshore reefs, erosion control, etc.
