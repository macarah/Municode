Editor's note— Ord. No. 02-0928, §§ 1—8, adopted Aug. 21, 2002, was not specifically amendatory of the Code and has been included as art. IX, §§ 36-501—25-508 at the editor's discretion.

Sec. 26-501. - Title.
This article shall be known as the Fulton County Groundwater Recharge Areas Protection Ordinance.
(Ord. No. 02-0928, § 1, 8-21-02)
Sec. 26-502. - Intent and purpose.
The purpose and intent of this article is to protect Fulton County's surface water and groundwater supplies and resources. The surface water and groundwater protection regulations shall be used in conjunction with the Fulton County's plumbing codes, Soil and Erosion Control Ordinance, and stormwater and septic tank regulations to provide protection and conservation of the county's surface water and groundwater supplies and resources.
(Ord. No. 02-0928, § 2, 8-21-02)
Sec. 26-503. - Definitions.
Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Director means the director or his/her designee of the Fulton County Department of Environment and Community Development.
DRASTIC means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600-2-87-035. (Note: the DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility).
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area.
Pollution susceptibility map means the relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources, using the DRASTIC methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia).
Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
Septic tank means an approved watertight structure installed underground to receive sewage from a building, effecting separation and organic decomposition of sewage solids and discharging effluent to an absorption field or another element of an onsite sewage management system.
Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces.
(Ord. No. 02-0928, § 3, 8-21-02)
Sec. 26-504. - Establishment of the groundwater recharge area protection district.
A groundwater recharge area district (hereinafter the district) is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of unincorporated Fulton County that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and made a part of this article.
(Ord. No. 02-0928, § 4, 8-21-02)
Sec. 26-505. - Determination of pollution susceptibility.
Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and made a part of this article.
(Ord. No. 02-0928, § 5, 8-21-02)
Sec. 26-506. - Protection criteria.
The following regulations shall apply to all lands within the district.
(1)
No construction shall proceed on any development to be served by a septic tank unless the Fulton County Board of Health first approves the proposed septic tank installations as meeting the requirements of the Fulton County Code of Laws for Sewage Disposal, the Fulton County Board of Health Rules and Regulations for Sewage Disposal, and the Georgia Department of Human Resources Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereinafter DHR manual), and the requirements of this article.
(2)
New residences served by an individual septic tank/drain field system shall be on lots having minimum size limitations that are 110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of Table MT-1 of the DHR Manual (hereinafter DHR Table MT-1). The minimums set forth in Table MT-1 may be increased further by department of human resources (DHR) based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A—F) of the DHR Manual.
(3)
New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than five × ten 7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the natural resources conservation service.
(4)
New above ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks having a minimum volume of 660 gallons shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements.
(5)
New facilities which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable local, state, and federal spill prevention requirements and fire code requirements.
(6)
Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall be prohibited.
