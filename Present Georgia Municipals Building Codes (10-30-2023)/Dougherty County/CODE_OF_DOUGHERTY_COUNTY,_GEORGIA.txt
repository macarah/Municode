PREFACE
This Code constitutes a compilation of certain state laws of local application and a complete recodification of the resolutions and ordinances of Dougherty County of a general and permanent nature.
The Code of Ordinances is a codification of the resolutions and ordinances of the County of a general and permanent nature. Such Code supersedes all such resolutions and ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1979 Code, and Acts of the General Assembly and resolutions and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Board of Commissioners. It should be noted that the 1979 Code was never officially adopted by the board; it was used, in the preparation of this Code, as a "starting point" for source material. The source of each section is in this Code is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent act or resolution or ordinance included herein.
The chapters of Part II of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume.
Numbering System
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state codes. Each section number consists of three component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the first dash referring to the part number, the figure before the second dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the second dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1-6 is numbered 1-6-1 and the fourth section of Chapter 2-3 is 2-3-4. Under this system, each section is identified with its part and chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 8-3-1 and 8-3-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 8-3-1.1, 8-3-1.2 and 8-3-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 1-3 and 1-4, it will be designated as Chapter 1-3.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division.
Index
The general index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by county officers and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
