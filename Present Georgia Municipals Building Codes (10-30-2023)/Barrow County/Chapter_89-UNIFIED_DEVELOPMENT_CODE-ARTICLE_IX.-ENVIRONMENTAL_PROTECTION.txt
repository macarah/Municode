Sec. 89-1052. - Permitting requirements.
(a)
Requirement for local permit.
(1)
No land disturbing activity will be permitted within protected wetlands without written permission in the form of a local development permit from the county.
(2)
If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands boundary, as determined using the National Wetlands Inventory Map, no land disturbance permit will be issued by the county until a Section 404 Permit or letter of permission is issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers if the wetlands area falls under Corps jurisdiction.
(3)
Issuance of a development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.
(4)
All activities that are not allowed in this Development Code shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a development permit.
(b)
Section 404 Permits; when required.
(1)
If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a protected wetland boundary, as determined from the NWI Map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall also be required.
(2)
If the Corps determines that jurisdictional wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a Section 404 Permit or letter of permission is required, a development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 Permit or letter of permission.
(c)
Conservation easement required. Any protected wetlands area that will be retained in any subdivision or development project is to be included within a conservation or natural resources easement that meets the requirements of this article.

DIVISION 6. - NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AREAS

Sec. 89-1070. - Purposes of natural resource conservation.
The purposes of this division, among others, are as follows:
(a)
To recognize the current development rights of property owners established through zoning;
(b)
To conserve open land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural features such as stream buffers, floodplains, and wetlands, by setting them aside from development;
(c)
To support the continued viability of agricultural activities in the county, including crop production, dairying and managed forestry;
(d)
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of existing vegetation and to encourage minimization of development on steep slopes;
(e)
To enhance water quality of streams and waterways, and to protect valuable groundwater resources;
(f)
To encourage conservation of scenic views and elements of the county's rural character, and to minimize perceived density by minimizing views of new development from existing roads; and
(g)
To provide notification to property owners of natural resources that must be protected on their property.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-1071. - Designation of conservation areas.
(a)
Primary conservation areas. Primary conservation areas are defined as follows:
(1)
River and stream channels. These areas are defined as the area between the top of bank and the opposite top of bank of any river, stream or other body of water classified as "state waters".
(2)
Required river and stream buffers. Natural vegetative stream buffers along the banks of all protected state rivers and perennial streams and other state waters, as required by this article (except for activities that are exempt from the soil erosion and sedimentation control provisions of the Land Development Activities Article of this Development Code).
(3)
Wildlife habitats of threatened or endangered species. The animal and plant species listed on Table 9.2 have been identified by the federal and/or the state governments as threatened or endangered species in Barrow County.
(4)
Protected wetlands. Wetlands are illustrated generally on the National Wetlands Inventory Maps published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and as otherwise delineated by the U.S. Corps of Engineers.

(5)
Buffer areas around wetlands and habitats of endangered species. Additional lands in their natural state provided around designated wetlands and critical wildlife habitats as protective buffers are recognized as primary conservation areas. To qualify, a wetland buffer must extend at least 25 feet from the wetland, and a buffer around a wildlife habitat must be at least 100 feet deep.
(6)
100-year floodplain. All areas within the 100-year floodplain but lying outside any wetland or other designated primary conservation area fall under this category. The boundaries of the 100-year floodplain are designated as the "flood hazard area" on maps prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and must be confirmed as to their specific location by the design professional.
(b)
Secondary conservation areas. Secondary conservation areas are areas that are encouraged (but not required) to be protected. These include:
(1)
Areas greater than 5,000 square feet of steep slopes over 25 percent. Slopes greater than 25 percent can be identified from the topographic data required for the preliminary plat or site plan for a development. Areas comprising 5,000 contiguous square feet or less are not considered secondary conservation areas.
(2)
Areas greater than 40,000 square feet with slopes of 15 percent to 25 percent. Slopes between 15 percent and 25 percent can be identified from the topographic data required for the preliminary plat or site plan for a development. Areas comprising 40,000 contiguous square feet or less are not considered secondary conservation areas.
(3)
Soils with exposed bedrock or rock outcroppings greater than 40,000 sf. Areas with exposed bedrock or rock outcroppings must be identified through observation on each site. Areas comprising 40,000 contiguous square feet or less are not considered secondary conservation areas.
(4)
Mature timber stands or significant trees. Forests and timberlands that have mature stands of trees qualify for conservation consideration. Individual trees that have significance through their size, age, species or historic value may be designated as a secondary conservation area to the extent of the tree's dripline. See Article VIII, Buffers and Tree Conservation.
(5)
Registered historic or archeological assets. Sites or areas registered with the state or the National Register of Historic Places qualify under this category since preservation is desirable but not mandated by law. Information regarding all such sites is available from the Georgia Office of Historic Preservation.
(6)
Viewshed protection areas. These areas may be set aside either to screen the view of the development from abutting roadways or to protect existing scenic views into the development site of rural heritage features. Examples of rural heritage features include the following:
Table 9.3: Rural Heritage Features
EXPAND
Groves of mature trees Hedgerows Rock outcroppings
Cultivated fields Ponds Woods
Pastures Bridges Fence Lines
Rolling hills Farm buildings Curves in rural roads
  If intended to screen the subdivision development, the viewshed buffer must be adequately vegetated with trees and understory growth to provide an opaque screening effect. If intended to preserve a scenic view, the viewshed protection area must provide an adequate width or orientation in order to preserve the view.
(7)
Village greens, parkways. These areas create neighborhood assets by providing open space and passive recreation close to the homes in a subdivision. A village green is an open space area surrounded by streets and/or building lots on at least three sides, and intended for common neighborhood use. A parkway is a narrow strip of open space surrounded by streets on all sides, intended as a landscaped element or passive recreation area for the neighborhood.
(8)
Passive recreational areas. Common open space areas solely designated and improved for passive recreational activities, such as picnicking, walking, relaxation and repose, may be treated as secondary conservation areas. Active recreation areas, including but not limited to golf courses, swimming pools, sports fields and courts, and community buildings and grounds are not considered secondary conservation areas.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-1072. - Allowed uses in natural conservation areas.
The following requirements apply only to land set aside for conservation in fulfillment of the provisions of this article:
(a)
Undisturbed areas. Certain areas identified as primary or secondary conservation areas shall remain in their natural, undisturbed state. Such undisturbed areas include river and stream channels, stream buffers, viewshed buffers, critical wildlife habitats and buffers, wetlands and wetland buffers, and mature timber stands (except for managed forestry activities, including harvesting).
(b)
Allowed uses in other conservation areas. The following uses are allowed in natural resource conservation areas to the extent that they are compatible with the protection and preservation of areas required by law but not otherwise required to remain undisturbed, and are allowed uses under the site's zoning classification:
(1)
Conservation of open land in its natural state (for example, woodland, open field, or managed meadow).
(2)
Agricultural and horticultural uses, including raising crops, pasturelands and dairy operations, along with associated buildings (including residences) that are specifically needed to support an active, viable agricultural or horticultural operation. Specifically excluded are commercial livestock operations involving swine or poultry.
(3)
Pastureland for horses used solely for recreational purposes. Equestrian facility buildings and grounds shall be permitted but may not be located in any primary conservation area.
(4)
Silviculture, in keeping with established standards for selective harvesting and sustained yield forestry, and best management practices endorsed by the Georgia Forestry Commission.
Figure 9.4 - Backup Drainfield
(5)
Neighborhood open space uses such as village greens, commons, picnic areas, community gardens, trails, multi-purpose sports fields, and similar low-impact recreational uses specifically excluding motorized off-road vehicles, rifle ranges, golf courses, sports courts, community recreation buildings and grounds, swimming pools, and other active recreation uses.
(6)
Pathways and trails, and passive recreation activities such as fishing, picnicking, and nature interpretation.
(7)
Water supply, sewage disposal system reserve fields and stormwater detention areas designed, landscaped, and available for use as an integral part of the conservation area. The septic tank and drain field required for on-site sewage disposal must be located on the lot of the house it serves. Areas within a conservation area used for water supply, backup drainfields or stormwater detention must be located outside of any primary conservation area and must be established by easements between the appropriate parties and recognized in the conservation easement covering the area.
(8)
Easements for drainage, access, power, natural gas, sewer or water lines, or other public purposes, as approved by the public works director and in keeping with conservation of the areas they traverse.
