ARTICLE V. - SUBDIVISIONS AND MASTER PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS

Sec. 89-461. - Purpose of article.
This article presents the different ways that land can be subdivided and developed, ranging from conventional subdivisions, to open space subdivisions where green space and natural features are preserved by reducing lot sizes, to various types of master planned developments including mixed use master planned developments, traditional neighborhood developments, and senior housing subdivisions, which allow a wider variety of housing types in a well-planned, walkable environment that maximizes green space -and provides a variety of amenities.

Sec. 89-462. - Minor subdivisions.
(a)
Minor subdivisions; general.
(1)
A "minor subdivision" is the subdivision of five or fewer lots in which each lot has frontage on an existing county street or road, and which does not involve the construction of a new street or the widening of an existing roadway, the provision of stormwater drainage facilities (other than driveway culverts), or the construction or improvement of any public utilities.
(2)
Minor subdivisions, as more fully described under this section, shall be reviewed and processed as final subdivision plats under the provisions for such plats in the procedures and permits article of this Development Code.
(3)
The term "original tract" as used in this section means a unit of land which the owner holds under single or unified ownership, or which the owner holds controlling interest in, on the effective date of adoption of this Code.
(4)
The term "contiguous common parcels" as used in this section means parcels adjoining or touching other land at a common point and having a common owner, regardless of whether or not portions of the parcels have separate tax lot numbers, or were purchased in different land lots, or were purchased at different times.
(b)
Types of minor subdivisions. Minor subdivisions are defined as, and limited to, any one of the following:
(1)
Recombination. The sale or exchange of portions of adjoining lots between separate or common owners of adjoining properties, including the recombination of existing lots of record, provided that additional lots are not thereby created, and that all resulting lots are in accordance with the zoning and other provisions of this Development Code, and all other applicable laws and regulations.
(2)
Minor subdivision plat. In order to be approved as a minor subdivision plat, the division of land must create no more than five lots, building sites, or other divisions (including the remaining portion of the original tract) and meet the following criteria:
a.
Each lot shall front on an existing paved public road and meet the minimum requirements of the zoning district.
b.
Each lot shall access the existing paved public road by way of a shared driveway unless approved for an individual driveway access by the public works department.
c.
All slope and utility easements, as well as required street rights-of-way as determined by the planning and community development director based on the comprehensive plan, are provided at no cost to the county.
d.
Each proposed lot shall comply with the requirements of the health department whose certification of approval shall be required prior to the approval of the final plat by the planning and community development director.
e.
The potential location of a driveway connection serving each lot and meeting the requirements of these development regulations must be reviewed and approved by the public works department and shall be indicated on the final subdivision plat.
(3)
Estate subdivision. Estate subdivisions may be developed in the AG agricultural zoning district under the following provisions:
a.
Each lot created by the subdivision, including the remaining portion of the original tract, must contain ten acres or more.
b.
Each proposed lot shall provide at least 100 feet of frontage upon the street, shall provide at least 150 feet of lot width measured in accordance with the requirements of this Development Code, and shall meet or exceed all other minimum requirements of the AG zoning district. These dimensions must be increased to 200 feet of frontage and 300 feet of lot width if further subdivision (under subsection e. below) is anticipated or desired.
c.
Each proposed lot abuts upon an existing paved public street.
d.
All slope and utility easements, as well as required street rights-of-way, as determined by the planning and community development director based on the comprehensive plan, are provided at no cost to the county.
e.
Each lot, thus created, may be re-subdivided into lots of no less than five acres as a minor subdivision pursuant to these regulations, provided that each such lot shall meet all requirements of this Development Code (including minimum lot width and frontage).
f.
Each proposed lot shall comply with the requirements of the health department whose certification of approval shall be required prior to approval of the final plat by the planning and community development director.
g.
The potential location of a driveway connection serving each lot and meeting the requirements of these development regulations must be reviewed and approved by the public works department and shall be indicated on the final subdivision plat.
(c)
Limitations on minor subdivision.
(1)
Purpose. It is the intent of the board of commissioners to provide for the division of land not a part of a larger common plan of development (i.e., as a minor subdivision), whereby a tract of land may be divided into not more than five individual tracts of land, provided all tracts of land within the minor subdivision have appropriate frontage, access, and otherwise comply with all county regulations, including this Development Code.
(2)
Chain subdivisions prohibited. Minor subdivisions provide certain development advantages that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications. Given these development advantages, there is a risk that subdividers may seek to divide a parcel via consecutive and/or contiguous minor subdivisions, instead of filing as a major subdivision. It is the intent of the board of commissioners to prohibit the practice of such "chain" subdivisions that seek to evade the major subdivision development regulations such as where the same land owner subdivides land and then files additional minor subdivision applications of the same land or on contiguous common parcels, which collectively creates six or more lots within a period of three years. It is also the policy of the board of commissioners to prohibit the division of lots adjacent to each other within a three-year time period, in cases where part of an original tract of land is now owned by another person or entity and was transferred or sold to another owner with the apparent intent to circumvent the requirements for major subdivisions. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, nothing in this section shall prohibit the division of land or adjacent parcels if such division results in the creation of a total of five or fewer lots within a three-year period, provided all tracts of land within the minor subdivision have appropriate frontage, access, and otherwise comply with all county regulations, including this Development Code.
(3)
Contiguous common parcels shown on subdivision plats. Contiguous common parcels, as defined by this section, shall be referenced on all applications for subdivision of land, and contiguous common parcels shall be considered part of any application for subdivision of land, for purposes of determining whether or not the division of land proposed is a part of a larger common plan of development, but is being submitted as a minor subdivision in an apparent attempt to circumvent the requirements for major subdivisions. Common contiguous parcels shall not be counted as lots in the case of a minor subdivision.
(4)
Additional limitations. This section only applies to the division of property into not more than five total parcels, and within any three-year period. This provision shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of two contiguous subdivisions under separate ownership; however, this provision is intended to be construed liberally so that one property owner does not develop a subdivision on part of an original tract and transfer or sell another part of the original tract for the purposes of subdivision within a three-year period.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-463. - Major subdivisions.
Major subdivisions; defined. A "major subdivision" is any subdivision that does not qualify as a "minor subdivision" under section 89-462, or any subdivision of fewer than six lots that involves the construction of a new public or private street. A major subdivision commonly involves the construction of a new street or widening of an existing roadway, the provision of stormwater drainage facilities, or the construction or improvement of public utilities, or which otherwise has six or more lots (not in a large lot minor subdivision), building sites or other divisions.
(a)
Types of major subdivisions. Major subdivisions fall into five categories for the purpose of development regulation:
(1)
Conventional subdivisions. Wherein the maximum density allowed for the zoning district determines the maximum number of lots in the subdivision, and all of the lots meet the minimum lot size and other dimensional requirements for the zoning district as shown on Table 4.1 of article IV. Open space outside of the lots may be created but is not required.
(2)
Open space subdivisions. Wherein the zoning district density limitation may be increased as provided in this article and the minimum lot size is reduced to allow for maximum flexibility on a site and in order to create conservation areas, open space and recreational amenities for the residents.
(3)
Mixed use master planned developments. A type of master planned development in which the zoning district density limitation may be increased as provided in this article and the minimum lot size of the zoning district is reduced in order to create open space and recreational amenities for the residents. Depending on the zoning district in which a master planned development is located, flexibility in housing types, mixed-use projects and certain commercial uses are allowed.
(4)
Traditional neighborhood developments. A type of master planned development in which the zoning district density limitation may be increased as provided in this article and the minimum lot size of the zoning district is reduced in order to provide walkable, compact neighborhoods, a mix of uses and housing styles, and encourage neighborhood interaction, safety, and security.
(5)
Senior housing developments. A type of master planned development in which the zoning district limitation may be increased as provided in this article and the minimum lot size reduced in order to provide a development of neighborhoods with specialized design oriented toward senior citizens. These neighborhoods are age-restricted with amenities geared toward the senior residents.
The following table presents a summary of the requirements of this article as they apply to each of the three types of major subdivisions. Refer to the text and other tables of this article for specific provisions.

Sec. 89-466. - Mixed use master planned developments.
modified
The mixed use master planned development provides a development opportunity that mixes types of housing and nonresidential properties within the same development.
(a)
Special approval required. Because mixed use master planned developments allow housing types and nonresidential uses that may not otherwise be allowed in the zoning district, approval of a special use is required.. An application for a mixed-use master planned development shall follow the zoning process for special use approval as prescribed in Section 89-1316 with the following modifications:
(1)
All such special use approval applications shall be accompanied by a zoning exhibit for review and approval by the planning and community development director. The zoning exhibit shall provide all information necessary to demonstrate that it achieves the criteria provided in section 89-466 (this section), as applicable.
(2)
If the special use approval application is approved by the board of commissioners, then such zoning approval shall be conditioned to the applicant achieving development in substantial conformity with the zoning exhibit, including any modifications or conditions approved by the board of commissioners pursuant to its deliberations on the application.
(3)
Zoning exhibit approval shall not constitute entitlement to permits.
(4)
Each applicant for a mixed-use master planned development shall provide evidence of the unified, single ownership of the entire parcel, consistent with the provisions of section 89-466(g).
(5)
In addition to meeting the requirements of section 89-1316, the zoning exhibit shall include the following information:
a.
A location map showing the boundaries of the property and identifying the current zoning of the property, as well as zoning on adjacent properties.
b.
A plan showing applicable details, to include lots, streets and right-of-ways, setback lines, dwelling sizes, off-street parking, on street parking, street trees, sidewalks, multiuse trails, stormwater management facility areas, floodplain and wetland boundaries, topography and open space.
c.
Specifications, calculations and applicable percentages for common open space, density calculations, lot sizes, land use, gross and net acreage, dwelling units, and parking.
d.
Color-rendered elevations of front, sides and rear of all typical units, including proposed building materials, building heights and any other structures.
e.
Conceptual signage plan.
(6)
Phasing plan. A phasing plan shall be submitted with the concept plan, and approved by the planning and community development director, unless the entire development is to be completed at one time. Such phasing plan shall describe and illustrate in written and graphic format the incremental implementation of the mixed-use master planned development over a number of years, including the sequence, timing and responsibility for construction of each building, support facilities, infrastructure and utilities. Revision of the phasing plan is permitted and must be approved by the planning and community development director prior to each construction phase.
(7)
Concept plan. A concept plan must be submitted and approved by the planning and community development director after the special use approval process and prior to submittal of an application for a land disturbance permit. The purpose of the concept plan review is to ensure the soundness of the proposed development, compatibility with the surrounding area and compliance with zoning conditions. The concept plan shall be developed in substantial conformance with the zoning exhibit approved by the board of commissioners, along with any conditions added thereto by the board of commissioners.
(8)
Building plans. Prior to issuance of a building permit for any occupied structure to be located within a mixed-use master planned development, the builder shall provide architectural plans and elevations at a scale no smaller than ⅛"=1'-0" that demonstrate compliance with the zoning exhibit and any conditions added thereto by the board of commissioners.
(9)
Other requirements. The applicant shall adhere to all other applicable requirements of this Unified Development Code and other applicable requirements of Barrow County. In any case where the standards and requirements of this section conflict with other provisions of the Barrow County Code of Ordinances, the requirements of this section shall govern.
(b)
Criteria for approval.
(1)
Mixed use master planned developments (MUMPDs) are encouraged in appropriate locations throughout the county that allow the use of innovative techniques, such as traditional neighborhood design, resource conservation subdivisions, village concepts and mixed use development. Such master planned developments must provide compatible and unified development while allowing flexibility within the current zoning regulations.
(2)
All MUMPDs must propose innovative design, the protection and accommodation of important natural resources and open space. MUMPDs are reviewed individually to determine compatibility, suitability, and health, safety and welfare issues. Individual requirements relating to such developments become part of the concept plan through conditions of zoning.
(3)
Review criteria. The following is a list of criteria that will be used by the county to determine the suitability of a proposed MUMPD in addition to the standards for approval of a special use contained in the procedures and permits article of this Development Code:
a.
The uses proposed will not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses;
b.
Exceptions from this Development Code are warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the development plan;
c.
Mixed use master planned development is in conformance with the general intent of this Development Code and the Barrow County Comprehensive Plan; and
d.
The MUMPD must be deemed by the board of commissioners to incorporate features of exceptional architectural, landscaping or site design prior to MUMPD approval. Such plans upon which this determination is made shall be incorporated into the MUMPD approval of the project.
(b)
Development parameters. The following general conditions apply to mixed use master planned developments (MUMPDs) according to the zoning district of the property:
(1)
The proportion and distribution of nonresidential to residential uses in a MUMPD is determined by the zoning category of the property. The zoning district also determines the maximum number of dwelling units and the type of commercial development that can be allowed in the MUMPD. These limitations and the distribution of residential density are shown on Table 5.1.

Sec. 89-467. - Traditional neighborhood development.
modified
Traditional neighborhood developments (TND) provide an opportunity for compact, walkable neighborhoods with a mix of uses and housing types.
(a)
Purpose:
(1)
To allow for compact neighborhoods designed at a human scale.
(2)
To encourage walkable, interconnected neighborhood street design.
(3)
To provide a mix of uses, including residential, commercial, civic, and open space uses in close proximity to one another within the neighborhood.
(4)
To provide a mix of housing styles, types, and sizes to accommodate households of all ages, sizes, and incomes.
(5)
To encourage neighborhood interaction, safety, and security through design.
(b)
Special approval required. Because traditional neighborhood developments allow housing types and nonresidential uses that may not otherwise be allowed in a zoning district, approval of a special use is required. An application for a traditional neighborhood development shall follow the zoning process for special use approval as prescribed in section 89-1316 with the following modifications:
All such special use approval applications shall be accompanied by a zoning exhibit for review and approval by the planning and community development director. The zoning exhibit shall provide all information necessary to demonstrate that it achieves the criteria provided in section 89-467 (this section) as applicable.
(1)
If the special use approval application is approved by the board of commissioners, then such zoning approval shall be conditioned to the applicant achieving development in substantial conformity with the zoning exhibit, including any modifications or conditions approved by the board of commissioners pursuant to its deliberations on the application.
(2)
Zoning exhibit approval shall not constitute entitlement to permits.
(3)
In addition to meeting the requirements of section 89-1316, the zoning exhibit shall include the following information:
a.
A location map showing the boundaries of the property and identifying the current zoning of the property, as well as zoning on adjacent properties.
b.
A plan showing applicable details, to include lots, streets and right-of-ways, setback lines, dwelling sizes, off-street parking, on street parking, street trees, sidewalks, multiuse trails, stormwater management facility areas, floodplain and wetland boundaries, topography and open space.
c.
Specifications, calculations and applicable percentages for common open space, density calculations, lot sizes, land use, gross and net acreage, dwelling units, and parking.
