ARTICLE VII. - SIGN REGULATIONS

Sec. 89-781. - Purpose of article.
This article regulates the number, location, size, placement, sign type, type of illumination and other features related to the appropriate time, place and manner for signs and sign structures to be displayed and constructed in the county.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-782. - Sign regulations; purpose and findings.
(a)
Basis for restrictions imposed.
(1)
The commission has considered the aesthetic and safety reasons for limiting signage in the unincorporated areas of the county. The commission has determined that signs can detract from the aesthetic beauty of the county. Further, unregulated sign proliferation may contribute to a lowering of commercial and residential property values. Lastly, signs can be detrimental to the safety of motorists in the county. It is found by the commission that limiting the number, type, and dimension of signs in accordance with the following regulations will serve these substantial governmental and community interests.
(2)
The commission is well aware that signs are a means by which the county's residents, organizations, institutions, and businesses may convey constitutionally protected commercial and noncommercial messages. The following regulations provide an appropriate balance between the right to communicate via signs and the protection of the community interests stated above.
(b)
Regulation of signs. No sign shall be placed or maintained on any property, building or other structure within Barrow County except in conformity with these Sign Regulations.
(c)
Intent of sign regulations; free speech. Notwithstanding any other restrictions in this article, any sign authorized under this article can contain any commercial or non-commercial message, other than messages containing nudity or obscenity as defined herein, or other than a sign that advertises an activity that is illegal under Georgia or federal laws.

(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-786. - Measurement of sign area and height.
(a)
Computation of sign area. In order to determine compliance with the maximum allowable sign areas permitted under this article, the following shall establish how sign areas are measured. The terms "sign area" and "sign face area" are interchangeable and have the same meaning for the purpose of regulating maximum sign sizes.
(1)
Sign face area.
a.
The area of a sign face shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of a sign face, or the combination of the areas of all such rectangles delimiting each sign module, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed.
b.
For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes all of the sign's words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements intended to convey the sign's message shall establish the area of the sign's face.
c.
For signs applied to a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign face shall be computed as the largest rectangular area achieved from any one view of the sign. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on the sign.
d.
The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those portions contained within the rectangle that delimits the sign face or a sign module.
Figure 7.2. Sign Face Area Calculations
e.
Manual changeable copy signs. For any sign on which any of the words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements are routinely changed or are intended to be changed from time to time the sign face area shall include the entire area within which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements may be placed, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed.
(2)
Sign structure area.
Figure 7.3. Examples of Sign Structure Area Measurements (2)
a.
The area of a sign structure shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of the surface of a sign whereon the sign face or sign modules may be placed, including all portions of a sign structure that provide a background for the sign face but are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature.
b.
For a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign structure shall be the largest measurement achieved from any view of the sign structure. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on or bisecting the sign structure.
c.
Project entrance signs. For project entrance signs or other signs that are imposed, mounted or painted on a wall or other decorative structure, the sign structure area shall be computed as that portion of such wall or other decorative structure that is discernibly devoted to the support of the sign or, by its design or architectural treatment, intended to provide a background or frame for the sign.
(3)
Treatment of open spaces. Any open space contained within the limits of the rectangle delimiting the sign face, sign module, or sign structure shall be included in the computation of the area of such sign face, sign module, or sign structure.
(4)
Multi-faced signs.
a.
Double-faced signs. For double-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel (back-to-back), or where the smallest angle formed between the two faces is 60 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For double-faced signs where the interior angle formed by the faces is more than 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be the total area of all sides.
b.
Signs with three or more faces. For sign structures having only three faces and the interior angle formed between all of the faces is 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs with three or more sides, the area of the sign shall be the largest total of all faces that are joined by an interior angle of more than 60 degrees that can be viewed from any one direction.
(b)
Measurement of sign height. The height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the average grade at the base of the sign, or from the crown of the roadway of the nearest street within 50 feet of any portion of the sign, to the highest point of any portion of the sign, whichever results in the greater sign height. Any earthen berm or elevated foundation constructed to support a sign, its signposts or other sign supports, shall be included in the height of the sign.

If there is more than one remaining sign, this percentage may be allocated among the remaining signs. In no event shall the sign face area of any remaining sign be increased by more than 100 percent. By way of illustration, if an owner of a shopping center exceeding 200,000 square feet elects to forego one of the four permitted signs, he might elect to increase the sign face area of one of the remaining signs by 100 percent, or he might elect to increase the sign face area of one remaining sign by 50 percent and the two other signs by 25 percent each, etc.

(1)
The commission has considered the need for commercial and non-commercial speech through the medium of signs, in the unincorporated portions of the county. These interests must be weighed against the aesthetic and safety concerns that have been enumerated elsewhere in this article. After thorough consideration of these countervailing interests, the commission has developed the following regulations regarding the total number and structure of signs in the unincorporated portions of the county:
a.
A total of 25 signs that are otherwise in conformance with the regulations found in this article shall be allowed in accordance with section 89-891(c), in the unincorporated portions of the county.

As a result of this section, once the number of signs within the unincorporated portions of the county reaches 25, no more permits for signs shall be issued.

Whenever a billboard is removed, the owner of such removed sign shall be allowed to erect and operate a billboard at a permissible location as allowed by this section, if the owner makes application for such a permit within 12 months of the removal date.
