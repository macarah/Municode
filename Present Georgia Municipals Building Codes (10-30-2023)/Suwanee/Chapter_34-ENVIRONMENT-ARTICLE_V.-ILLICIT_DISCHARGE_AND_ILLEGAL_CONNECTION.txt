Sec. 34-300. - Reserved.
Editor's note— Ord. of Dec. 21, 2010, deleted § 34-300, which pertained to outdoor water use and derived from Ord. of 6-28-2007, §§ 1(34.300), 1(34.301).
Sec. 34-301. - Title.
This article shall be known as the "Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection Ordinance".
(Ord. No. IDO-2004-002, § 1, 12-21-2004; Ord. of 11-24-2009, Exh. A)
Sec. 34-302. - Authority.
The authority for this article is based on home rule provisions of the Georgia Constitution, Article IX, Section 2, Paragraph 3(a)(6).
(Ord. No. IDO-2004-002, § 1, 12-21-2004; Ord. of 11-24-2009, Exh. A)
Sec. 34-303. - Findings.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
The city separate storm sewer system was designed and installed to manage stormwater so as to prevent localized flooding, damage to property and risk to public safety;
(2)
The city separate storm sewer system was not designed or installed as a receiving system for nonstormwater discharges;
(3)
Discharges to the city separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
(4)
These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments;
(5)
These nonstormwater discharges not only impact local waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters;
(6)
The impacts of these nonstormwater discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
(7)
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city separate storm sewer system;
(8)
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of nonpoint source pollution caused by nonstormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system;
(9)
The Clean Water Act requires the management and maintenance of the city separate storm sewer system and the management of discharges to that system;
(10)
Therefore, in order to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system, it is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
(Ord. No. IDO-2004-002, § 1, 12-21-2004; Ord. of 11-24-2009, Exh. A)
Sec. 34-304. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of nonstormwater discharges into the city separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Comply with all Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act;
(2)
Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the city separate storm sewer system;
(3)
Prevent nonstormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the city separate storm sewer system; and
(4)
To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article.

(a)
The director or his designee may grant a variance from the requirements of this article if exceptional circumstances applicable to a site or premises exist such that strict adherence to the provisions of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship and will not fulfill the intent of the ordinance. Specifically, such variances may be granted in such individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the director or his designee that:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular site in question;
(2)
The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the impact on upstream and downstream properties;
(3)
The application of the ordinance to this particular site would create an unnecessary hardship;
(4)
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular site involved;
(5)
Such conditions are not the result of any actions of the site owner;
(6)
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good nor impair the purposes or intent of this article; and
(7)
No variance may be granted for a site for any discharge that is prohibited by this article or which would result in a deterioration of quality of stormwater from a site greater than would otherwise be allowed if no variance were involved.
(b)
