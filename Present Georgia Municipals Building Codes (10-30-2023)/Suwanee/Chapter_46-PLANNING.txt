These guidelines are intended to enhance the visual aspect and livability of the entire city. They are intended to encourage an old-town look and feel of historical state villages. These guidelines will foster architectural diversity and interest yet achieve and maintain a consistent, durable and pleasing aesthetic/visual quality. The use of a common palate of building materials should be maintained for all building facades to create a consistent and traditional architectural identity. Traditional architecture includes the use of red brick, pitched roofs, low-profile signage and subdued colors. For large commercial/retail buildings, variations in facade, roofline and depth should be provided to lend the appearance of multi-tenant occupancy.

@ For industrial/warehouse buildings less than 30,000 square feet gross floor area.
# Allowed for buildings intended to have a residential appearance. Building must have a minimum 4:12 roof pitch.
(3)
Accent/trim exterior building material. Small amounts of building materials such as wood, tile, etc., may be used to enhance the elevation of the building or for decorative elements but should not exceed ten percent of the total wall area per facade.
(4)
Facade calculations. With the exception of accent/trim materials there shall be no more than two primary building materials used.

ARTICLE III. - CHATTAHOOCHEE RIVER WATERSHED PROTECTION

Sec. 46-71. - Findings of fact.
(a)
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
(b)
The city has determined that land inside the city lies within the Chattahoochee River water supply watershed. This watershed is greater than 100 square miles in size and is categorized as a large water supply watershed under the provisions of this article. As of the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, no portion of the city lies within seven miles upstream of an active water supply intake or water supply reservoir.
(Ord. No. 99-001, § 1.1, 5-18-1999)
Sec. 46-72. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to the portions of the Chattahoochee River watershed which occur within the jurisdiction of the city and are identified as water supply watersheds in this article.
(Ord. No. 99-001, § 1.2, 5-18-1999)
Sec. 46-73. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Buffer means a natural or enhanced vegetated area located adjacent to a reservoir or perennial stream within a water supply watershed.
Corridor means all land within the buffer areas established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed.
Hazardous material/waste means any substance defined as hazardous waste by the state department of natural resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-8-60 et seq., as amended.
Impervious surface means a manmade structure or surface that prevents the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. An example includes buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools and patios.
Perennial stream means a stream that flows throughout the year as indicated by a solid blue line on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) seven-minute topographic series maps (scale 1/24,000).
Setback means the distance that defines the width of a protective buffer, measured from the boundary of the feature of the landscape (e.g. a wetland or stream bank) that the buffer is designed to protect.
Water supply watershed means the drainage area (watershed) of lands upstream of a governmentally-owned public drinking water intake or water supply reservoir.

ARTICLE V. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION

Sec. 46-156. - Findings of fact.
(a)
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. Therefore, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas.
(b)
Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. Therefore, it is necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(c)
According to available data provided by the state department of natural resources, the city contains significant groundwater recharge areas. According to the state groundwater pollution susceptibility map, the city is within an area having a low susceptibility rating (drastic rating less than 141).
(Ord. No. 99-002, § 1.2, 5-18-1999)
Sec. 46-157. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(2)
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
(3)
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.
(Ord. No. 99-002, § 1.3, 5-18-1999)
Sec. 46-158. - Amendments.
The regulations of this article may be amended from time to time in accordance with procedures and requirements in the general statutes and as new information becomes available.
(Ord. No. 99-002, § 7, 5-18-1999)
Sec. 46-159. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Groundwater recharge area means an area of the Earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer.
Hazardous material/waste means any substance defined as hazardous waste by the state department of natural resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-8-60 et seq., as amended.
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities.
Pollution susceptibility maps means maps prepared by the state department of natural resources that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential.
Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by the state department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of karst topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks) and potentiometric surfaces.

(b)
Protection of traffic and roadway. Unless specifically in the permit, no utility may occupy the city rights-of-way unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the city from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way or the right-of-way itself.
(c)
Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changed at any time by the city during the term of the permit and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city upon reasonable notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration, or relocation.
(d)
Installation of poles and other wireholding structures and relocation. Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wireholding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby.

(c)
When the construction under any permit is completed, the utility shall notify the department.
(Ord. of  9-26-2017 )
