Editor's note— Ord. of 11-29-2022(1) , Att. A, amended the Code by the addition of §§ 14-2—14-13; however, said provisions have been redesignated as §§ 14-22—14-33, at the editor's discretion, for purposes of allowing future expansion of the Code.

Sec. 14-22. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose and intent of enacting the following regulations is to allow Suwanee residents the right to keep and raise backyard chickens on single family residential lots.
Further, the city council finds it appropriate to regulate backyard chicken raising in the manner presented in this section, so as to be permissive enough to allow citizens to keep chickens on their property, but restrictive enough to protect the interests of neighboring residents from unnecessary noise, odor, and/ or other nuisances to the property.
Further, for purposes of this section, chickens also referred to herein as "backyard chickens" are allowed in conjunction with a single-family residential dwelling and subject to the performance standards and criteria set forth herein.
