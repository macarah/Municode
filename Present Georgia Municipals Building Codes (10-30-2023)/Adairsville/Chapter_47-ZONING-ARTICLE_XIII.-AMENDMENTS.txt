Another application to alter the same condition shall not be submitted more than once every 12 months, such interval to begin on the date of the final decision by the mayor and city council on said application to amend the condition.
(e)
Withdrawal. An application may be withdrawn without prejudice at any time prior to 6:00 p.m. on the day of the unified zoning board's hearing. The unified zoning board may give permission for a withdrawal without prejudice at its hearing.

Applicants and opponents to rezoning actions that change the zoning district on a parcel are requested to consult the Conflict of Interest in Zoning Act, O.C.G.A. ยง 36-67A-1, which requires disclosure of campaign contributions, made within two years of the rezoning application, and aggregating $250.00 or more, to any unified zoning board member or city elected official. Such disclosures should be filed at least five calendar days prior to the unified zoning board's hearing on forms available at the zoning office.
