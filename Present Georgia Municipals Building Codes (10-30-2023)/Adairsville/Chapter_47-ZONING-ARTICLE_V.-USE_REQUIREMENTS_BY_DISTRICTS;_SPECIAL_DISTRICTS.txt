Sec. 47-134. - Downtown Development Area Overlay District.
(a)
Purpose and intent.
(1)
Attractive and integrated architectural and site design features tend to improve an area's image, raise overall property values, attract new businesses and residents, and improve the quality of life. There is a positive return on investment for providing attractive design features, for both government and property owners, and can provide similar enhancements to public safety, community health, and well-being.
(2)
This section establishes an overlay district for a defined area in the historic downtown area of the city consistent with the downtown development area for the purposes of controlling land uses, setting standards and requirements for development, and providing for improved architecture and site design.
(b)
Map of overlay district boundaries. The map entitled "Downtown Development Area Overlay District," which is hereby made a part of this chapter, is hereby adopted.
(c)
Application and relationship to zoning districts. As to properties within the bounds of the Downtown Development Area Overlay District, this article establishes regulations that are in addition to the regulations of the underlying zoning district. Zonings districts established by this chapter, and as shown on the official zoning map, shall continue to apply in the overlay district, except as specifically modified by this section. This article imposes more restrictions on land uses within the overlay district than the rights conferred by underlying zoning and more land development standards than are applied outside the overlay district.

Residential uses. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Table of Permitted Uses, on lots zoned C-1 or C-2 in the downtown overlay district, residential use of property shall be allowed subject to the following criteria:
(1)
Single-family residential use consistent with these provisions shall be permitted by right; multifamily use shall be permitted by special use permit;
(2)
Residential use shall be permitted on the second story above ground level of the structure only; and
(3)
At least 50 percent of the ground floor of the structure shall be leasable commercial space not used for parking or self-service storage.
(f)
Design guidelines. To ensure that the properties within the overlay district have a harmonious outward appearance consistent with the historic nature of the downtown district, the following design guidelines shall apply:
(1)
Signs may not be illuminated except that each principal structure may have one internally-illuminated or neon window sign not exceeding three square feet in area.
(2)
A frame, sandwich type sidewalk or curb signs are allowed to be placed in front of the business, but shall not block the sidewalk and must be taken in at close of business.
(3)
Swinging or projecting signs are allowed to be placed on businesses, as long as they do not impair pedestrian traffic.
(4)
Facade easements requiring design approval have been recorded for many of the properties in the downtown development area; owners and occupants are advised to consult the public records prior to beginning any modifications to building facades. No owner or occupant may modify a structure or property in violation of the recorded facade easement.
(5)

(6)
