Nonpayment of a bill by the due date will subject the consumer to a penalty equal to 20 percent of the delinquent amount.
(2)
Nonpayment of a bill by the fifth day of the following month from when the bill became due will result in water being shut off to the consumer's property. In the event the city receives notice from a bank that a check that was submitted for payment for water and sewer service has been rejected for non-sufficient funds, the consumer shall be required to pay a NSF fee. Such fee shall be as fixed from time to time by the city council and will be published as part of a master fee schedule. The consumer will be sent a letter stating that their check was declined, the amount of the NSF fee, and the new total amount due. Payment of NSF fees will not be accepted by check.

(3)
Disconnection for emergency or necessity. The city reserves the right to turn off the supply of water from any pipe or water main in an emergency or for repairs or extensions as necessity may require. Reasonable notice shall be given when practicable; however, neither the city, nor its officers and employees shall be held liable for any damage for turning off the water as provided in this section or for insufficient supply of water.
(4)
Disconnection for violation. Upon the discovery of the violation of any section of this Code or other ordinance regulating the use of water or any rule regulating that use, the city shall discontinue water service to the consumer who committed, or allowed to be committed on his behalf, such violation and to the property owned, occupied or controlled by such consumer. The city shall, except in instances that may pose an imminent threat to the public health and safety, give the consumer prior written notice of the intention to disconnect the water service.
(c)

If the bill is not paid, the water shall be turned off and not turned on again until the bill is paid and permission given for continuance of the supply.
(g)
Amount of charges. There shall be assessed a fee for the unmetered usage of water from an unauthorized connection. If the classification of use is known, then the fee shall equal the applicable rate for that classification of use multiplied by the known or approximate number of gallons used.
