Sec. 68-8. - Functions.
(a)
The advisory board shall provide advice and recommendation to the board of commissioners, the county administrator, and the director of the community and leisure services division as to ways to improve the sister city program, the addition of new activities to the sister city program, the deletion of existing activities from the sister city program, ways to raise funds to support the sister city program, and any other matters that bear upon the scope and quality of the sister city program. In the event a vacancy occurs in the position of an "ambassador of goodwill", the advisory board may, but is not required to, provide advice and recommendations to the board of commissioners as to candidates to fill such position.
(b)
The advisory board may organize and conduct fundraising events and activities to raise funds for the support and improvement of the sister city program. All funds raised by the sister city program shall be deposited in a special account of the county to be designated the "sister city program enhancement fund" (hereinafter referred to as the "fund"). These funds shall not be used to offset funds that would otherwise be spent from other sources of county revenues to pay for the operation and improvement of the sister city program. The money in the fund shall be used for other expenses or costs including, but not limited to, travel, cultural programs and costs of entertaining visiting delegates, designated to ensure that the sister city program in the county is first class and excels above those of other governmental entities.
(c)
The advisory board shall annually prepare a proposed budget for the fund, to be presented to the board of commissioners in the spring of each year as part of its budgetary process. Once approved by the board of commissioners, this budget shall guide the use of the money in the fund during the ensuing July 1 through June 30 fiscal year. During the fiscal year, this budget may be modified by the board of commissioners as circumstances dictate. The advisory board may submit recommendations to the board of commissioners as to modifications in the approved budget when the advisory board determines modifications to be desirable.
(d)
The advisory board shall, throughout the fiscal year, submit requisitions to the county financial services division for the disbursement of money in the fund to pay for projects as designated in the approved budget, or to approved modifications thereto. The expenditure of money in the fund shall be administered by the county's financial officers, as are other funds; provided that requests by the advisory board for expenditures from the fund consistent with the approved budget shall require no further action on the part of the board of commissioners, unless shortfalls in the budget or revenues shall result in insufficient money in order to meet the requested expenditure.
(e)
The advisory board may attempt to facilitate the establishment and growth of the Ginny Husen Scholarship Fund. However, as this will be a private charitable fund and not a county fund, the advisory board shall not solicit donations for or make contributions to the scholarship fund. This shall not prevent members of the advisory board, acting in their individual capacities, from undertaking such activities as long as they make it clear that they are not acting in the name of Columbia County.
