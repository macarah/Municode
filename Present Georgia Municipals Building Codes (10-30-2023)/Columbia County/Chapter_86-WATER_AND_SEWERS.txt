(f)
Requirements.
(1)
Columbia County Water Utility.
a.
On new installations, the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services will provide on-site evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of backflow preventer, if any, that will be required, will issue permit, and perform inspection and testing. In any case, a minimum of a double check valve with a wye strainer will be required in any new commercial construction and a minimum of a dual check on any residential.
b.
For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or premises and inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to be made. Ordinarily, 90 days will be allowed, however, this time period may be shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the history of the device(s) in question.
c.
The Columbia County Water and Sewer Services will not allow any cross-connection to remain unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer for which a permit has been issued and which will be regularly tested to insure satisfactory operation.
d.
If the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services determines at any time that a serious threat to the public health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately.
e.
The Columbia County Water and Sewer Services shall have on file, a list of private contractors who are certified backflow device testers. All charges for these tests will be paid by the owner of the building or property.
f.
The Columbia County Water and Sewer Services requires all reduced pressure principle devices and double check valve backflow preventers include the installation of strainers located immediately upstream of the backflow device. The installation of strainers will preclude the fouling of backflow devices due to both foreseen and unforeseen circumstances occurring to the water supply system such as water main repairs, water main breaks, fires, periodic cleaning, and flushing of mains, etc. These occurrences may "stir up" debris within the water main that will cause fouling of backflow devices installed without the benefit of strainers.
(2)
Owner.
a.
The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of all cross-connections on his premises.
b.
The owner, after having been informed by a letter from the department, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test, or have tested, any and all backflow preventers on his premises.
c.
The owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer which is revealed by periodic testing.
d.
The owner shall inform the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services of any proposed or modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the owner is aware but has not been found by the department.
e.
The owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass. Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place.
f.
The owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved by the Columbia County Water Utility.
g.
The owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services or the EPD.
h.
Any owner having a private well or other private water source, must have a permit if the well or source is cross-connected to the Columbia County Water Utility's system. Permission to cross-connect may be denied by the Columbia County Water Utility. The owner may be required to install a backflow preventer at the service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even if it is not cross-connected to the Columbia County Water Utility's system.
i.
In the event the owner installs plumbing to provide potable water for domestic purposes which is on the Columbia County Water Utility's side of the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed.
j.
The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for permits, annual or semi-annual device testing, retesting in the case that the device fails to operate correctly, and second re-inspections for non-compliance with the Columbia County Water Utility.
(g)
Degree of hazard. The Columbia County Water and Sewer Services recognizes the threat to the public water system arising from cross-connections. All threats will be classified by degree of hazard and will require the installation of approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention devices or double check valves.
(h)
Permits. The Columbia County Water and Sewer Services shall not permit a cross-connection within the public water supply system unless it is considered necessary and that it cannot be eliminated.
(1)
Cross-connection permits that are required for each backflow prevention device are obtained from the Columbia County Water Utility.
(2)
Permits shall be renewed annually and are non-transferable. Permits are subject to revocation and become immediately revoked if the owner should so change the type of cross-connection or degree of hazard associated with the service.
(3)
An initial inspection permit is required on new residential dual check backflow preventer.
(i)
Existing in-use backflow prevention devices. Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, an in the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment, any existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle device, or a reduced pressure principle device must be installed in the event that no backflow device was present.
(j)
Periodic testing.
(1)
All backflow devices shall be tested and inspected at least annually.
(2)
Testing must be performed by licensed backflow tester approved by the State of Georgia.
(3)
Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be repaired or replaced at owner's expense. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair the device will be retested at owner's expense to insure correct operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not more than 30 days after the test date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair tools, or a replacement device. Parallel installation of two devices is an effective means of the owner insuring that uninterrupted water service during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity. Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified in subsection (1), above, in cases where there is a history of test failures and the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services feels that due to the degree of hazard involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be borne by the owner.

The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results thereof to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user may not be required to resample if the director monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the director samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of such sampling.
(Code 1979, § 2-7-69)
Sec. 86-161. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(a)
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous wastes shall notify the POTW, the EPA's regional waste management division director and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA's hazardous waste number and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user:
(1)
An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes;
(2)
An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month; and
(3)
An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection shall be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted as set forth in section 86-157. The notification required in this subsection does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements set forth in sections 86-153, 86-155 and 86-156.
(b)
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as set forth in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as set forth in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(c)
In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA's regional waste management waste division director and the state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(d)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. The provision of this subsection does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued under this article or any applicable federal or state law.
(Code 1979, § 2-7-70)
Sec. 86-162. - Analytical requirements.

(Code 1979, § 2-7-71)
Sec. 86-163. - Sample collection.
(a)
Except as set forth in subsection (b) of this section, a user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. If flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that such technique will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(b)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(c)
Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities, if such pretreatment facilities exist, or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment facilities exist. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards as defined in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(5).
(Code 1979, § 2-7-72)
Sec. 86-164. - Submission of reports.

In the case of monthly or other longterm average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of the violation.
(b)
Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue at a rate of one percent per month. The director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties.
(c)
Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the director to reconsider the fine, along with full payment of the fine amount, within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the director may convene a hearing on the matter. If the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any penalty and accruing interest, shall be returned to the user.
(d)
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
(Code 1979, § 2-7-82)
Sec. 86-174. - Emergency suspensions.
(a)
The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, when such discharge threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
(b)
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate such contribution. If a user fails to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as he deems necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to any person. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the revocation proceedings set forth in section 86-175 are initiated against the user.
(c)
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting an imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under section 86-169 or 86-175(a).
(d)
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Code 1979, § 2-7-83)
Sec. 86-175. - Revocation of wastewater discharge permit.
(a)
The director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
(1)
Failure to notify the director of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge;
(2)
Failure to provide prior notification to the director of changed conditions pursuant to section 86-157;
(3)
Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application;
(4)
Falsifying self-monitoring reports;
(5)
Tampering with monitoring equipment;
(6)
Refusing to allow the director timely access to the facility premises and records for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling;
(7)
Failure to meet effluent limitations;
(8)
Failure to pay fines;
(9)
Failure to pay sewer charges;
(10)
Failure to meet compliance schedules;
(11)
Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge permit application;
(12)
Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business ownership of a permitted facility;
(13)
Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or violation of any conditions or terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this article;
(14)
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; or
(15)
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volumes, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge.
The user will be notified of the proposed revocation of its permit and be offered an opportunity to show cause as set forth in section 86-169 why the proposed permit revocation should not be taken. Exercise of such option by the director shall not be a bar to or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
(b)
Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a particular user are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit to the user.
(Code 1979, § 2-7-84)
Sec. 86-176. - Injunctive relief.
When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition the county superior court, or such other court as may have jurisdiction through the county attorney, for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The director may also take such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against a user.
(Code 1979, § 2-7-85)
Sec. 86-177. - Civil penalties.
(a)
A user who has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall be liable to the county for a minimum civil penalty in an amount set forth in section 1-9, per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other longterm average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
(b)
The director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the county.
(c)
In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as justice requires.
(d)
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against a user.
(Code 1979, § 2-7-86)
Sec. 86-178. - Criminal prosecution.
(a)
Any person who violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to the penalties and costs as set forth in section 1-9.
(b)
Any person who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to the penalties and costs as set forth in section 1-9.

(c)
A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or who knowingly falsifies, tampers with or renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article, shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to the penalties and costs as set forth in section 1-9.
(Code 1979, § 2-7-87; Ord. No. 00-10, § 7(b), 10-3-2000)
Sec. 86-179. - Remedies nonexclusive.
The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The director may take any, all or any combination of such actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the county's enforcement response plan. However, the director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Code 1979, § 2-7-88)
Sec. 86-180. - Affirmative defenses.
(a)
A user shall have an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance of the prohibitions established in section 86-133(a), (b)(3)—(b)(6) and (b)(8) if the user can demonstrate that:
(1)
It did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference; and
(2)
a.
It was in compliance with each local limit in its discharge that caused the pass through or interference directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or
b.
If no local limit exists for the pollutants that caused the pass through or interference, its discharge directly prior to and during the pass through or interference did not change substantially in nature or constituents from its prior discharge activity when the county was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit requirements and, in the case of interference, applicable requirements for sewage sludge use or disposal.
(b)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the user can demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that:
(1)
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset;
(2)
The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures;
(3)
The user shall have submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if such information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
a.
A description of the indirect discharge and the cause of noncompliance;
b.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
c.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance;
(4)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof; and
(5)
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(Code 1979, § 2-7-89)
