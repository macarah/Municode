ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 2-1. - Code of ethics and conduct.
(a)
Declaration of policy. It is the policy of the city that the proper operation of government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the government structure; that public office not be used for personal gain or harm to others; that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government and that public servants/officials are provided the information necessary to comply with these requirements. In recognition of these goals in this section and in the City Charter ethics requirements, this code of ethics and conduct for all persons serving or acting on behalf of the city as defined below (covered persons) is readopted with updates.
This section has the following purposes: (1) to encourage high ethical standards in conduct by covered persons in compliance with state Law, OCGA Sections 45-10-1, 45-10-3; (2) to establish standards of conduct for all such covered persons by setting forth those acts or actions that are expected of all such persons and those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the city; (3) to require disclosure by such covered persons of substantial private financial or other substantial interests in matters known to the covered person that affect the city; and (4) to serve as a basis for fairly and reasonably determining whether violations to this section have occurred and, if so, disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to political contributions, loans, expenditures, reports or regulation of political campaigns or the conduct of candidates in such campaigns.
(b)
Scope of persons covered. This code of ethics and conduct supersedes all prior City of Madison ethics regulations (except the City Charter) and shall be applicable to: the Mayor and Council, Municipal Court Judge (prohibitions but not procedures in event of an alleged violation) and all City Officials as defined below (all the foregoing collectively referred to as "Covered Persons"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, state law and the Charter of the city shall be controlling in the event of an actual conflict with the provisions of this code of ethics and conduct. This section shall be interpreted to supplement, and not replace, said provisions of state law and the charter.

To the extent it is so determined that such indemnification is proper, the person claiming such indemnification shall be indemnified to the extent now or hereafter permitted by Georgia law. Attorney fee reasonableness shall be by the "lodestar" method approved by the Georgia Supreme Court or such other method approved by said court. The indemnification provided above shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under the City Charter, ordinances and/or bylaws, or any agreement, or any vote of mayor and council or other disinterested body of which the covered person is not a member, or otherwise, as to action in the person's official capacity. To the extent permitted by Georgia law, the city may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of covered persons.
