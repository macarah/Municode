(c)
Placement of merchandise for display, sale, advertisement limited. It shall be unlawful to place, for purposes of display, for the sale or advertisement of any property or merchandise whatsoever, upon the public sidewalks of the city except as provided herein. Each day in which merchandise is so placed shall constitute a separate violation of this section.
(1)
In accordance with [sub]section[s] 62-4(a) and (b), wherever wide sidewalks exist within the downtown commercial district as provided by the current zoning ordinance, the appearance zone may also be utilized for product display provided:

(d)

(1)
An application with the application fee as established by the city council shall be filed with the manager, or his designee, prior to any use or placement of any item upon public property.
(2)
The manager shall use reasonable discretion to determine whether and to what extent the use of the appearance zone interferes with the considerations of this section as well as those outlined in [sub]section[s] 22-6(5)—(8) and specific limitations outlined in [sub]section 22-9(d).
(3)
Use of the appearance zone shall be in accordance with the approved application and shall not be modified without the written consent of the manager.

(5)
The manager at his reasonable discretion may require removal for any reason. Failure to remove items and cease use of public property shall result in a removal of such items by the manager. The business shall be responsible for all expenses incurred by the city for the removal and storage of such items.
(6)
Except for actions arising out of the city's sole negligence, the business agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the city and all its officers, officials, representatives, agents, and employees, from any and all claims, liability, damages, or causes of action which may arise out of the license or licensee's use of the appearance zone. Commercial general liability insurance shall be maintained with an A-rated insurance company and shall be in the amount of $1,000,000.00 per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage.

The city council finds that downtown Madison comprises the heart of the city's central business district and is one of the major transportation routes through the city and Morgan County, as well as the tourist industry center for the city. The importance of a commercially-thriving downtown has been recognized by the citizens of the city by their support for downtown improvements funded by the downtown special tax district and a special purpose local option sales tax. Infrastructure and aesthetic improvements to the downtown commercial area have been on-going since the 1980s including streetscape improvement projects, facade grant program, design guidelines and design review, and special project/event planning. Downtown Madison has become congested with street furniture and fixtures, such as publication racks, and other sidewalk encroachments competing with pedestrians for the public space, obstructing ingress to and egress from properties adjoining the public rights-of-way, interfering with the good appearance of and access to public sidewalks and streets. The public investment in the landscaping and sidewalk improvements made in downtown Madison needs to be protected from damage by and the detrimental effects of unbridled proliferation of publication racks ungoverned by any criteria for placement of design throughout the downtown district. The need for special standards for placement of publication racks on sidewalks and other public rights-of-way is greatest in the downtown commercial area due to the greater frequency of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and publication rack locations in such area, compared to other parts of the city. Special standards for the design and location of publication racks, and the enforcement of existing regulations for other sidewalk encroachments in the downtown commercial area, will help to create a sense of order out of chaos and provide a friendly, pleasing and safe environment for those who come to the area. The city council has recognized and addressed the need for special standards for other sidewalk encroachments in the area, including sidewalk cafes as well as business enhancement and displays, and now finds it timely to do so for publication racks.
c.
The city council finds that the regulation of publication racks as set forth in this chapter provides the least intrusive and burdensome means for ensuring that the purposes stated in this chapter are carried out while still providing ample opportunities for the distribution of news and information to the citizens of the city and Morgan County by means of publication racks located within public rights-of-way and public property in the downtown district.
(2)
Area special standards. The following standards shall apply to publication racks and the placement of publications in publication racks within any special publication rack area so designated pursuant to sub[section] (1) of this section:
a.
No publication shall be placed in a publication rack located in a special publication rack area except within a publication rack permitted and provided by the city.
b.
Original placement of publication racks within a special publication rack area.
1.
No publication rack shall be located in a special publication rack area unless a permit has been obtained in accordance with subsection 2. or subsection 3. below:
2.
Within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance designating a special publication rack area, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the manager shall establish a date (the "cut-off date") by which application shall be made to the manager for use of a publication rack located within a special publication rack area. No application shall be considered that is filed later than the cut-off date established for that area. The manager shall also endeavor to mail notice of the cut-off date to the owners and/or distributors of publication racks existing as of the effective date of the ordinance designating a special publication rack area, provided, however, that failure to provide mailed notice to any person shall not invalidate any action taken pursuant to this section or this chapter.
3.
The process for obtaining a permit shall be in accordance with section 62-55, provided that where the number of publication racks for which an application has been made exceeds the number of publication racks available in publication rack modules in a special publication rack area, the manager shall issue publication rack permits in the manner described in procedures established by the manager and approved by the city council.
c.
After the original placement of publication racks within a special publication rack area, as described in subparagraph b. of this subsection (2), application may be made for use of a publication rack in a location within a special publication rack area for which no empty publication rack is available in a publication rack module. Such applications shall be placed on a waiting list. In the event a publication rack in a publication rack module becomes available, the manager shall issue a permit for that location to the applicant for the location if there is only one applicant. In the case of multiple applicants for a single location, the manager shall determine which applicant shall receive the permit in the manner described in procedures established by the manager and approved by the city council.

Sec. 62-56. - Standards for maintenance and display of publication racks.
Every permittee under this chapter shall comply with the following requirements:
(1)
Every coin-operated publication rack shall be equipped with a coin-return device that is maintained in good repair and working order by the permittee. It shall be the responsibility of the holder of a permit for a coin-operated publication rack to keep such coin-operation device in proper maintenance and order.
(2)
In addition, every coin-operated publication rack shall display information on how to secure a refund in the event of coin return malfunction. Such refund decal shall be placed in a visible location on the front of the publication rack and shall be legible.

(3)
Other than the display of the publication contained therein, no publication rack shall display or be affixed with any words or graphics except that, where feasible, based on the location of the publication rack within the publication rack module, one logo decal for the publication within is permitted in a visible location on the front of the publication rack; said decal shall be limited to the size described in procedures established by the manager and approved by the city council; said decal may also contain the required coin return information, if applicable. The decal will be affixed to each publication rack that has adequate space on the side of the rack by the manager. When logo or refund decals become defaced or worn, the permittee shall provide new decals for the city to place on the publication rack.
(4)
Old or out-of-date material removed from any publication rack by any person who owns, maintains, or stocks the publication rack shall be recycled or disposed of in a lawful manner.

(b)
Summary abatement. Prior notice and an opportunity to be heard shall not be required prior to removal of any publication rack that is installed or maintained in such a place or manner as to pose an immediate or clear and present danger to persons, vehicles or property or any publication rack that is placed in any location without a permit. In such case, the city shall proceed in the following manner:
(1)
Within the next working day following removal, the manager shall notify by telephone the permittee or, in the case of an unpermitted publication rack, the owner of the publication rack or a person whose name is shown on the required identification. Within three business days, the manager shall send written confirmation of the telephoned notice. The written confirmation shall contain the reasons for the removal and information supporting the removal, and shall inform the recipient of the right to request, in writing or in person, a post-removal meeting within four business days of the date of such written notice. If the owner of an unpermitted rack cannot be determined and the rack does not contain the required identification, no notice of the removal shall be required.
(2)
Upon timely request, the manager shall provide a meeting within seven working days of receipt of the request, unless the requesting party agrees to a later date. The proceeding shall be informal, but oral and written evidence may be given by both sides. The manager shall give his or her decision in writing to the requesting party within 48 hours after such meeting. If the manager finds that the removal was proper, he or she shall notify the requesting party to pay any applicable penalties and costs and to recover the publication rack. If the manager finds that the removal was improper and that placement of the publication rack was lawful, the manager shall order that the publication rack be released and reinstalled without charge.

(b)

(c)
The manager shall notify the permittee of any publication rack deemed abandoned that such permittee must surrender the permit or provide written reasons why such permit should not be revoked or amended to delete the abandoned publication rack within ten days of the date of the written notification.
(d)
Failure to respond or provide sufficient reason why the manager should not revoke or amend said permit shall result in the manager revoking such permit or amending such permit to delete the abandoned publication rack. The publication rack under such revoked permit or deleted from the permit shall be made available for reassignment to another applicant under the provision of sections 62-54 and 62-55 of this chapter.
(e)
The permittee may surrender the permit to the manager prior to its expiration, when the permittee no longer wishes to distribute the publication through the publication rack.
