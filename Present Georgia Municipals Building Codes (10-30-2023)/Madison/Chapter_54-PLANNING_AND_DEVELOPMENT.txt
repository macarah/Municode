(Amd. of 12-14-2015(2),§ 1(Exh. A, § 1))
Sec. 54-52. - Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose and intent of this article to provide for the transfer of development rights from one property to another to (1) permanently provide for natural areas/habitat protection, riparian areas, greenspace buffers, agrarian landscapes, potential trails, gateways, recreation, and historic landmarks, and (2) locate density in proximity to infrastructure, services, and amenities for the benefit of the citizens and the municipality and the city's future growth. Further this article provides a means to achieve the visions and goals of the 2004 Joint Comprehensive Plan, as amended, the 2009 Madison Greenprint Addendum, as amended, and the 2011 Urban Redevelopment Plan, as amended.
(Amd. of 12-14-2015(2),§ 1(Exh. A, § 2))
Sec. 54-53. - Applicability of regulations.
The provisions of this article apply only to property within Madison.
(Amd. of 12-14-2015(2),§ 1(Exh. A, § 3))
Sec. 54-54. - Transferrable development rights program.
The TDR program provides for both the permanent protection of prioritized natural, historic, and cultural resources and the development and/or redevelopment of areas prioritized for higher density. The TDR program allows for the transfer of the "right to develop" from sending parcels (parcels prioritized for protection) to receiving parcels (parcels prioritized for greater density).
(Amd. of 12-14-2015(2),§ 1(Exh. A, § 4))
Sec. 54-55. - Sending parcels.
(a)
Eligibility.
(1)
Owners or authorized representatives with the authority to transfer fee simple title of any qualifying sending parcel are eligible to apply for a TDR certificate(s). Sending Parcels are those parcels from which development rights may be created and transferred and may include:
a.
Parcels that meet all of the following criteria:
1.
Are within the City of Madison;
2.
Include one or more of the following resources, which must be identified in the 2009 Madison Greenprint Addendum, as amended:
i.
Natural areas/habitat protection: Relatively natural habitat of fish, wildlife, or plants, or a similar ecosystem; or
ii.
Riparian areas: Streams, rivers, wetlands, ponds, or lakes, including a 100-foot buffer on either side of the riparian resource; or
iii.
Greenspace buffers: Areas of open space, greenspace, and/or agrarian landscapes which soften the impact of infrastructure and development while defining a sense of arrival into the city; or
iv.
Agrarian landscapes: Landscapes which include agrarian land uses, such as row crops, prime agricultural soils, orchards, timber, etc.; or
v.
Potential trails: Land areas for passive outdoor recreation by, or for, the use and education of the general public; or
vi.
Gateways: Areas where transportation networks provide entrance into Madison; or;ol4;
vii.
Recreation: Generally land areas for passive, neighborhood recreation by, or for, the education of the public.
b.
Any city-owned parcels within Madison which meet the criteria in Subsection 54-51(a)(1)a.2.
c.
Any historic landmark: a historic structure associated with significant historic landscape and/or landscape features, listed in the 2009 Madison Greenprint Addendum, as amended, and further registered as a Landmark by the Madison Historic Preservation Commission.
(2)
TDRs created from city-owned parks and greenspaces shall be conveyed to the TDR Bank. Revenues generated by the bank from the further conveyance of these TDRs shall be used for the protection of additional lands that meet the criteria in subsection 54-51(a)(1)a.2. Where only a portion of a parcel that meets the above criteria is in the TDR program area, the entirety of the parcel in the city limits shall be considered eligible as a sending parcel.
(3)
Parcels not eligible as sending parcels are as follows:
a.
Any parcel from which all TDRs have previously been severed; or
b.
Any parcel on which a perpetual conservation easement has been previously granted, removing all development potential; or
c.
Any parcel which has used all development rights afforded to the parcel under current zoning; or
d.
Any parcel or portion of a parcel that has been designated as open space as a requirement of a development agreement, zoning ordinance, or development regulation.
(b)
Calculation of TDRs on sending parcels. TDRs that are available to be created and transferred from sending parcels are calculated on the basis of baseline density of the sending parcel, as per the Madison Official Zoning Map, adopted on March 28, 2011, less any existing dwelling units. For parcels within residential zoning districts (i.e., R, R1, R2, R4, R6, R8), the baseline density shall be the gross acreage of the parcel divided by the minimum lot area of the zoning district. For non-residential zoning districts, baseline density shall be calculated at four units per acre. The area of a parcel with fractional acreage will be rounded down to the nearest One-quarter acre.
(c)
Permanent protection of sending parcels. Sending parcels, or portions thereof, where TDRs are being sought shall be permanently protected by conservation easements prior to the creation of TDR certificates. To convey the certified TDRs from a sending parcel, a perpetual conservation easement executed by the owner or authorized representative of the sending parcel and held by an organization authorized by the laws of Georgia to accept and hold conservation easements, per O.C.G.A. § 44-10-1 Georgia Uniform Conservation Easement Act, must be signed and recorded with the Morgan County Superior Court Clerk prior to the deed of transfer.
(1)
The city may develop a model conservation easement, which meets the provisions of the Georgia Uniform Conservation Easement Act, and require it be used to fulfill the requirements of this article; and
(2)
Each conservation easement executed to create TDRs on a sending parcel shall contain the serial numbers of the TDRs being created.
(d)
Creation of TDRs from sending parcels.
(1)
In order to create TDRs from sending parcels, the owner or authorized representative of a qualified sending parcel must complete the following application process:
a.
