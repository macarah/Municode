ARTICLE 98-4. - ZONING DISTRICT PURPOSE, USES AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS
This article presents purpose statements, uses, and dimensional standards.

Sec. 98-4.1. - Introduction to uses table.
This article also presents table 4.1, uses table with permitted uses and special uses by zoning district as exhibit A, that lists all uses permitted by zoning district, designated by the letter "P," and those uses subject to approval of a special use, designated by the letter "S." The process for special use approval is found in section 98-14.12, special use approvals.
A.
Uses in the planned development district shall be as indicated in the development agreement. The Thomaston Gateway North Overlay does not address uses as these are as indicated by the underlying zoning district.
B.
Table 4.1 does not list all accessory uses but clarifies uses acceptable as accessory to a listed principal use.
C.
Table 4.1 is provided as a convenience and therefore, is not as detailed as the use descriptions found in the section 98-2.3, definitions, or in article 98-5, development standards. In the event of a conflict between table 4.1 and the text of this chapter, the text of this chapter shall prevail.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-4.2. - Purpose statement for all zoning districts.
The zoning districts established in this chapter are generally "exclusive" rather than "cumulative" as concerns allowed uses for the purpose of reserving land for the most appropriate uses. Cumulative ordinances allow all the permitted uses of the less intense zoning districts while the list of allowed uses of exclusive ordinances can be specifically tailored to the context. This approach enables the city to more closely adhere to the character areas map adopted in the 2018-2038 Comprehensive Plan. Character areas are described in the plan as areas that "may be identified by the types of development found there which vary from historic downtowns, commercial/industrial areas, or residential neighborhoods." This "exclusive" approach reinforces the historic development pattern that is the result of market forces and public policy over decades. The state department of community affairs is quoted in the plan as follows concerning these unique areas: "Character areas have unique or special characteristics, have potential to evolve into a unique area when provided specific and intentional guidance, or require special attention due to unique development issues."
Such "intentional guidance" and "special attention" can be achieved through adoption and implementation of such tools as zoning ordinances. The comprehensive plan can be most effectively implemented when taken together with an exclusive list of allowed uses deemed most compatible with the character area assigned to property on the character areas map.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-4.3. - Purposes common to all single family detached development.
The 2018-2038 Comprehensive Plan establishes the following community goal as a means of preserving the sense of place that characterizes Thomaston: "Encourage new development that is compatible with the traditional features of the communities." Thomaston encompasses historic neighborhoods that contribute to a sense of place. This emphasis on development compatible with the traditional features, which includes architectural style, is bolstered by a land use policy adopted in the plan: "We will encourage development that is sensitive to the historic context, sense of place, and overall setting of the communities." New residential development in Thomaston's historic neighborhoods should be compatible with the pallet of historic architectural styles.
A housing need and opportunity adopted in the comprehensive plan cites both a need to "maintain the unique character and architectural heritage of Upson County…" and to "Improve the standards of new homes being proposed for development or placement in the County." The Plan also cites a potential for "…increased subdivision style residential and homes that complement adjacent historic homes" in the residential development character area. This plan guidance substantiates adoption of building materials standards found in article 5, development standards.
An adopted plan policy to "Increase home ownership and affordable housing opportunities for local residents on new and redeveloped properties" in Thomaston argues in favor of such development standards as moderate lot size and minimum floor area as a means of creating affordable housing opportunities. These lot size and floor area standards are applicable to development in Thomaston's historic neighborhoods.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-4.4. - Purpose, permitted uses and dimensional standards in single family detached residential districts.

(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-4.6. - Thomaston commercial districts.
Thomaston's commercial districts consist of the C-1 neighborhood commercial district, a C-2 general commercial district and a DT downtown district. Gateway Area One, proposed for renaming as "Thomaston Gateway North Overlay," is an overlay designated on the official zoning map along U.S. 19 north of the downtown, with the majority of the base zoning being C-2. These districts and the overlay are addressed below:
98-4.6.1. C-1 Neighborhood commercial district.
98-4.6.1.1. Purpose. The purpose of the C-1 Neighborhood commercial district is to serve the consumer needs of residents of the immediate neighborhood. Building heights and mass as well as parking ratios are tempered by a desire to promote compatibility with adjacent and nearby residential uses and create a walkable setting. The scale of individual lots and buildings accommodate developments that do not tend to attract traffic from outside the neighborhood.
A policy adopted in the comprehensive plan states: "We will target reinvestment to declining existing neighborhoods, vacant or underutilized sites or buildings in preference to new economic development projects." Investment in small shops can enhance the market attractiveness of neighborhoods by contributing to a sense of place and attachment of residents. The character areas and land use section of the plan, under commercial development acknowledges that "Development occurred in the classic sprawl type pattern."
The neighborhood commercial district represents an opportunity to attract pedestrian scale uses in nodal development patterns much as a number of in town Atlanta neighborhood commercial districts have been successful at. The range of uses excludes auto-oriented uses, uses that attract visitors from outside the neighborhood, and favors the service and entertainment establishments fulfilling the consumer needs of nearby residents. Thomaston's historic East Thomaston and Martha Mill neighborhoods appear ideally suited to realizing plan goals of "reinvesting in declining neighborhoods" and "minimizing sprawl along" Thomaston's street network.
98-4.6.1.2. Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted in the C-1 Neighborhood commercial district. Any use not specifically named as permitted shall be prohibited.

A.
Maximum floor area. Floor area shall be consistent with the floor area of similar establishments in neighborhood commercial settings comparable to the scale of the Thomaston community.
B.
Setbacks. Building setbacks shall be zero unless abutting a residential use which shall require a minimum setback from the common property line of 15 feet. Front yard setbacks may be greater than zero, provided site amenities such as outdoor dining are accommodated in the front yard. Parking in the front yard may be allowed only when other locations prove impractical to the satisfaction of the building official.
C.
Facade material design. The use of contrasting exterior finish materials shall be required sufficient to add visual interest. The mix of siding types shall be consistent and proportional on all building elevations.
D.
Building exterior finish materials. Building exterior finish materials in all nonresidential construction shall consist of full-sized brick, steel, glass, natural wood, natural stone, true hard-coat stucco, and fiber cement siding (Hardie board). Synthetic finishes complying with "Dryvit" standards and acceptable to the city may be allowed. Other materials similar in appearance and composition to the above materials may be used, subject to approval by the building official. Concrete block, synthetic stucco, plywood, T1-11 wood siding, Masonite, particle board, non-cement composite board and any siding materials found to lack durable characteristics shall be prohibited.
E.
Maximum building height. Building height shall not exceed 35 feet.
F.
Maximum floor area. Mom and Pop operations characterizing neighborhood commercial district and catering to a very local market are expected in the C-1 neighborhood commercial district. The scale of such uses is generally 2,400 to 6,000 square feet. The location of these establishments is expected to be on local streets off the main routes, thereby reducing customer volumes and fostering walking. Accordingly, a maximum floor area of 6,000 square feet will be applied to uses in the C-1 district.
98-4.6.2. C-2 general commercial district.
98-4.6.2.1. Purpose. The purpose of the C-2 district is to address the consumer goods and services needs of commuters and visitors traveling on the city's arterial highways. Properties zoned C-2 tend to be developed in auto-dependent uses, featuring ample parking and "single purpose" shopping trips. Architectural style and building materials standards are not as strict as those found in the neighborhood commercial and downtown districts in recognition of the tendency of the latter properties to command higher land prices and the relative lack of available land in those walkable settings. C-2 uses, including locations in Thomaston, tend to be national chains each with unique branding through signature building materials, architectural design and color.
A wide range of permitted uses characterize the C-2 district, excepting those uses that may have detrimental effects on the environment and neighborhoods that often abut commercial development to the rear.
98-4.6.2.2. Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted in the C-2 general commercial district. Any use not specifically named as permitted shall be prohibited.
A.
Adult care home.

98-4.6.3. DT downtown district.
98-4.6.3.1. Purpose. The purpose of the DT downtown district is to promote a mixed use, intense utilization of land dedicated to attached residential, office, institutional, retail and service uses. As the county seat and home to the county courthouse, any new construction and renovation in the DT district must comply with strict standards. These standards and procedures for ensuring new development is consistent with historic development of the downtown are found in chapter 58, historic preservation. Examples of actual properties developed in the downtown and judged to be representative of desirable development and the secretary of the interior's "Standards for Historic Preservation Projects," including the secretary's "Standard for Rehabilitation," form the template for new construction and renovation.
The city master plan references a number of historically significant buildings located in the downtown study area, both residential and institutional, that complement the secretary of the interiors guidance. These examples form the backdrop for analyzing the appropriateness of proposed renovations and new construction. A number of the historic homes mentioned are the Atwater, Crawford, Gibson, Woodall, Britt and Scott-McDaniel Homes.
Historically significant sites include the R. E. Lee Institute, Glenwood Cemetery, the Old First Methodist Church, the Grace Primitive Baptist Church, the First Baptist Church, and the Thomaston-Upson Archives.
Implementation measures featured in the plan include "greenspace and open space protection," amid "downtown development." Accordingly, measures are adopted to preserve existing green space in the historic downtown and to mandate preservation of appropriate greenspace on development and redevelopment sites.
A "zero lot line" development pattern characterizes the downtown and building heights are set by the directly adjacent properties. Parking ratios are relaxed given the historic development of the downtown. However, given the historic parking shortages in many downtowns, proposed changes in use of property shall be monitored to ensure that proposed uses that generate higher parking demand and regulated as such by this chapter comply with the parking requirement prior to approval of the change in use. Similarly, given the close proximity of buildings in the downtown, uses that may have adverse impacts on adjacent and nearby uses may not be approved at particular locations based upon those impacts. Mixed use buildings are encouraged with retail, service and office uses typically on the ground floor and residential uses on upper floors and to the rear of those commercial uses. Low density residential uses that would displace more intense development are prohibited in the downtown district.
98-4.6.3.2. Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted in the DT downtown district. Any use not specifically named as permitted shall be prohibited.

98-4.6.4. Thomaston Gateway North Overlay.
98-4.6.4.1. Purpose. The comprehensive plan reflects that "Thomaston recommends improvement in street appearances and amenities of commercial businesses" of the Gateway Corridor. Site improvement standards for the Corridor, identified as Gateway Area One, and proposed for renaming as "Thomaston Gateway North Overlay," are adopted in the zoning ordinance and applied to designated properties as an overlay to the base zoning.
Improvements to developed properties are fostered by application of strong landscape standards for off-street parking lots enforced on new development and when site improvements or building renovations are proposed. One means of improving the function of such commercial corridors is elimination of excessive curb cuts. Another means is mandating interparcel access. Both are applicable to the Thomaston Gateway North Overlay.
Finally, strict sign controls have been adopted for Thomaston Gateway North Overlay to improve the appearance of this commercial area.
98-4.6.4.2. Generally. Thomaston Gateway North Overlay shall be subject to the following specific regulations, provisions and standards. Thomaston Gateway North Overlay is established as an overlay with standards in addition to the standards of the base zoning. The geography of this overlay is defined as follows: on the east by a line parallel with, and 45 feet easterly of, the right-of-way line of U.S. Highway 19 North; on the north by the centerline of Potato Creek; on the west by a line parallel with, and 45 feet westerly of, the right-of-way line of U.S. Highway 19 North; and on the south by the centerline of Goodrich Avenue.
A.
The minimum building setback line shall be 45 feet from the respective right-of-way line of U.S. Highway 19.
B.
That portion of Thomaston Gateway North Overlay located between the right-of-way line of U.S. Highway 19 and a line parallel with, and 30 feet from, said right-of-way shall be a "greenspace," implemented as follows:
1.
Thomaston Gateway North Overlay shall be devoted solely to the planting and maintenance of vegetation, as hereinafter specified, except that at each location where the state department of transportation issues a permit to construct a vehicle entrance or exit connecting the gateway property to said highway, a strip, equivalent in width to the width allowed by such permit at the point where the said right-of-way abuts the private property line, and no greater in length than 45 feet, may be used as a driveway, and may be covered with an impervious surface, to permit vehicular access through the greenspace.
2.
It shall be the duty of the owner, or the person in legal possession, of the greenspace to plant, and to maintain in living condition, by re-planting, if necessary, the greenspace in accordance with the minimum requirements provided for herein.
C.
The greenspace shall be maintained as a landscaped area reserved for trees, shrubs, ground cover, mulch, and other plantings appropriate for the site. The landscaping requirements may be accomplished by retaining existing, healthy trees, shrubs and plants, by planting new trees, shrubs and plants, or any combination of retained and planted vegetation meeting the minimum standards provided for herein.
D.
The minimum standards for greenspace shall be as follows:
1.
One "large" tree that will, at normal maturity, be expected to exceed 45 feet in height, for every 45 linear feet of highway frontage; or
2.
One "medium" tree that will, at normal maturity, be expected to exceed 35 feet in height, for every 35 linear feet of highway frontage; or
3.
One "small" tree that will, at normal maturity, be expected to exceed 20 feet in height, for every 25 linear feet of highway frontage; or
4.
One "utility tree or shrub" that will, at normal maturity, not be expected to exceed 15 feet in height, for every 20 linear feet of highway frontage; or
5.
Any combination of the foregoing plantings to meet the linear frontage requirements.
E.
Each tree planted to meet the foregoing requirements shall have a minimum caliper, measured at six inches above ground, of two inches.
F.
Portion of the greenspace not planted with trees or shrubs shall be planted with grass, ground cover, or flowers, or covered with mulch.
G.
The minimum requirements set forth in subparagraph D are intended to be an average determined by dividing the number of trees required into the total frontage of each parcel of property, so that retained or planted trees and shrubs may be grouped as part of the landscape design.
H.
The selection of tree and shrub species (for retention or planting), the height projections at maturity, and the selection of planting sites shall be made based upon the "recommended tree list" and "tree management guidelines," promulgated by the city tree board, which are attached to Ord. No. 874 as exhibit "A" and exhibit "B," respectively, and by this reference incorporated here and made a part hereof. Exhibits "A" and "B" are on file and available for inspection in the office of the city clerk.
I.
The retained or planted trees and shrubs shall be the largest size, which, at maturity, meet the "tree management guidelines."
J.
All plantings, and retention of existing trees, shall be done in a manner to eliminate immediate and future interference with above and below ground utilities and sidewalks.

The comprehensive plan recommends "Office and medical uses" in the medical park character area. Physician and health care offices are accommodated in the P-I district. The plan also cites "improvement of sidewalk and street appearance and amenities of commercial centers; and shared parking arrangements that reduce overall parking needs." The P-I district promotes shared parking to minimize paved areas to achieve such park-like settings and enhance project feasibility.
P-I developments buffer residential uses by affording a transition in development intensity from those more intense commercial uses and the adjacent neighborhood. In addition, reservation of open space is mandated in the P-I district and linking of open space is encouraged to attract quality development and building tenants.

E.
Provide for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets as well as lower development and housing costs.
F.
Produce an environment of stable character compatible with surrounding development.
Within the planned area, a variety of land uses may be permitted in an orderly relationship to one another and to existing land uses. This may be accomplished through application of sound comprehensive planning principles.
98-4.9.2. Determining the suitability of property for a PD zoning. The factors in this section and data submitted by the applicant with the development plan for a planned development shall be considered by the zoning commission and mayor and council when determining whether establishment of a PD district is appropriate. This will ensure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made. Land use decisions based on sound planning principles encourage development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthy and safe living conditions for city residents. Authority to approve an amendment creating a PD district rests with the mayor and council. After conducting a public hearing and considering recommendations from the zoning commission, mayor and council will render a decision on the proposed planned development. Mayor and council may approve, deny, or conditionally approve the development plan that shall comprise the conditions of zoning of the property.
Factors to be applied in determining the appropriateness of assigning a PD zoning to a particular property are as follows:
A.
The existing uses and zoning of the nearby property;
B.
The suitability of the property for the zoned purpose;
C.
The length of time the property has been vacant;
D.
The threat, if any, to public health, safety and morals presented by rezoning of the property;
E.
The extent to which the value of the property is diminished by the present zoning; and
F.
The balance between the hardship on the property owner and the benefit to the public in not rezoning.
98-4.9.3. Plan review and approval procedures. Plan review and approval procedures shall be as follows:
A.
Pre-application conference. Prior to filing a formal application for a planned development, the applicant is encouraged to confer with the building official and the zoning commission to review the general character of the plan on the basis of a tentative land use sketch, and to obtain information on projected programs, features, facilities and other matters concerning the proposed development.
B.
Submission of application for PD approval. Submission of an application for approval of a PUD shall be as follows:
1.
The applicant must file a petition with the building official for approval of the proposed planned development. The application must be supported by a development plan and a letter of intent.

Development plans approved with modifications require that the applicant file the following materials with the building official:
A.
Written notice of consent to the modifications.
B.
An appropriately revised site plan.
The official zoning map will then be amended. The site plan and supporting information of any approved development plan shall be properly identified and permanently filed with the city clerk.

98-4.9.5. Issuance of building permits. The building official shall issue building permits for buildings encompassed within the acreage covered by the approved development plan, provided a subdivision plat has been approved by the city and properly recorded. In addition, the proposed buildings must comply with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable standards, regulations and conditions of approval of the rezoning of the property.
A.
Revision of development plan following plan approval. Minor modifications to the development plan that do not exceed ten percent of the approved standards may be approved by the building official, provided such modifications are consistent with the purpose, intent and character of the development plan. A request for a modification to the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the modification and the reasons such modification is considered necessary or desirable.
B.
Any substantial change in the approved development plan that affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes shall be require the filing of a new PD zoning application and development plan.

If no construction has begun by then, or if the applicant fails to maintain the approved development schedule, approval of the development plan shall lapse. At its sole discretion and for good cause, mayor and council may extend the period for initiating construction of any phase of the project for one additional year. Should approval of the development plan lapse under this provision, mayor and council may require the filing of a new application for PD. Should the new application be denied, the PD district shall be removed from the official zoning map, and the zoning districts and development standards in effect prior to approval of the development plan shall be reinstated.

Gross acreage for residential development shall not include areas dedicated for street rights-of-way.
C.
Variance in required densities. Mayor and council may allow higher net or gross residential densities, as well as a higher density for a particular residential use, provided the applicant can demonstrate that such a higher density will not be detrimental to surrounding uses, especially adjacent and nearby neighborhoods. Minimum heated floor area for dwellings shall be as specifically approved for each PD.
