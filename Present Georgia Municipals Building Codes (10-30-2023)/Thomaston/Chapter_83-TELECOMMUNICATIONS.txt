Sec. 83-21. - Definition; location.
(a)
For purposes of this article, a tower shall be defined as any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or mare antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guy towers, or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telecommunication towers, man-made trees (with accessory buildings/structures) and other similar structures. The term also includes structures with one or more antennas intended for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication.
(b)
Towers shall not be located in any zoning district other than as may hereafter be provided by chapter 98, Zoning, of this Code.
(Ord. No. 912, § 1, 6-6-00)
Sec. 83-22. - General requirements.
(a)
A special building permit granted by the city council shall be required for the construction of all new communications towers within the city limits after the following factors are considered:
(1)
The proposed height of the tower;
(2)
Proximity to residential structures and residential district boundaries;
(3)
Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
(4)
Surrounding topography, tree coverage and foliage;
(5)
Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics which have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; and
(6)
Public safety.
(b)
All permit applications submitted to the public officer, shall include a complete inventory of the applicant's existing towers and receivers/transmitters located within the county including the location, height and co-location usage and capabilities of each structure. The public officer shall utilize such information to promote co-location alternatives for other applicants. For purposes of this article, public officer shall be defined as the person whose duty it is to enforce the building codes in effect in the city and his agents.
(c)
All applicants must demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the proposed antenna(s). Evidence of an engineering nature shall be documented by the submission of a certification by a registered engineer. Such evidence may consist of the following:
(1)
No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area that comply with applicant's engineering requirements on which applicant can locate its proposed tower.
(2)
No existing structure is of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
(3)
No existing tower or structure has sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna(s) and related equipment.
(4)
Applicant's proposed antenna(s) would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna(s) on the existing tower or structure.
(5)
The fees or costs required to share the existing tower or structure or to adapt the existing tower or structure for shared use are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable.
(6)
Such other limiting factor(s) as may be demonstrated by the applicant.
(d)
At the time of filing the application for a tower, the applicant shall provide a site plan and information regarding tower location, accessory structures, neighboring uses and proposed landscaping. Documentation must be submitted and certified by a qualified engineer delineating coverage and propagation zones, tower design and co-location capabilities.
(e)
In granting a special building permit, the city council may impose additional conditions to the extent determined necessary to minimize adverse effects on adjoining properties.
(Ord. No. 912, § 1, 6-6-00)
Sec. 83-23. - Standards.
(a)
All towers must be set back a distance of twice the full height of the tower from any residentially zoned property or structure used for residential purposes. This condition shall not apply in areas as may hereafter be provided by chapter 98, Zoning, of this Code.
(b)
All towers shall be separated from each other by a distance of at least 1,000 feet.
(c)
All new self-supporting towers must be designed and built in a manner that allows at least two other entities to co-locate on the structure.
(d)
All towers and their related structures shall maximize the use of building materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that effectively blend the tower facilities within the surrounding natural setting and manmade environment. Towers shall be painted so as to reduce their visual obtrusiveness, subject to any applicable standards of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Commercial advertising signs shall not be permitted on such towers or related structures.
(e)
Any tower which directly abuts a residentially zoned property shall have a minimum of 50 feet of landscaped buffer with a solid opaque fence or wall no less than six feet in height.
(f)
All landscaping plans shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect. For each 30 linear feet of perimeter fencing, no less than 2 trees and 2 shrubs shall be installed and permanently maintained. The remainder of the property shall be landscaped in accordance with city standards.
(g)
Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, that such requirements may be waived for alternative design mounting structures.
(h)
All towers shall be monopole designs except those that are greater than 150 feet in height and located a zoning district in which towers of such height are permitted.
(i)
All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and FAA.
(j)
Subsequent to council approval but prior to the issuance of any building permits, compliance with Section 106 of the Natural Historic Preservation Act, shall be demonstrated.
(k)
Tower heights shall be measured from the existing ground base level to the highest point on the tower or other structure, even if said highest point is an antenna, and shall be limited as provided by chapter 98, Zoning, of this Code.
(Ord. No. 912, § 1, 6-6-00)
Sec. 83-24. - Administrative approval.
(a)
The addition of transmitting and/or receiving whip antennas and panels to existing buildings or structures may be approved administratively by the public officer, so long as any such addition does not add more than ten feet in height to an existing structure greater than 50 feet in height or more than five feet in height to an existing structure less than 50 feet in height but greater than 20 feet in height and all necessary building permits are obtained. Such acceptable structures include buildings, signs, light poles, water towers, and other free standing nonresidential structures. Antennas attached to existing strictures, along with supporting electrical and mechanical equipment, shall be of a color identical to, or closely compatible with, that of the supporting structure. Notification shall be given to city council at least 15 days prior to the granting of said request, and if no objection is lodged, considered approved.
(b)
The public officer may administratively approve alternative mounting structures such as fake trees, clock towers, bell steeples, light standards, and similar alternative mounting structures, provided such alternative structure is determined by the public officer to satisfy the factors set forth in section 83-2. These structures shall also be exempt from the additional separation and setback requirements pertaining to towers. Notification shall be given to city council at least 15 days prior to the granting of said request, and if no objection is lodged, considered approved.
(c)
The public officer may administratively approve the shared use of an existing tower or structure by another provider, including the placement of additional accessory buildings or other supporting equipment. The public officer may administratively waive district setback requirements by up to 50 percent to accommodate the placement of such additional buildings or other supporting equipment in order to encourage the shared use of existing infrastructure.
(d)
The addition of antennas to an existing structure may be exempted from all setback requirements as hereafter provided by chapter 98, Zoning, of this Code.
(Ord. No. 912, § 1, 6-6-00)
Sec. 83-25. - Removal of antennas and/or towers.
All towers shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such towers. If upon inspection by the public officer such tower is determined not to comply with the code standards and to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance. The owner of the tower may appeal the determination by the public officer by filing a written appeal to the city manager within ten days of the receipt of the notice of noncompliance by the owner. The city manager shall hold a hearing within five days of receiving said written appeal. In the event the appeal is unsuccessful and the offending tower is not brought into compliance within 30 days of the city manager's decision, the city may remove the tower in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-7 through 41-2-17 and chapter 18 of this Code.
