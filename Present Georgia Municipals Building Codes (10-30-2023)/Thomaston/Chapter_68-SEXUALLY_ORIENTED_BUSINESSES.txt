Sec. 68-1. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials that is protected by the Constitution. Neither is it the intent nor the effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.
(b)
Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses on a community presented in a hearing, and in reports made available to the mayor and council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (199 1); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, (1986); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); Iacobucci v. City of Newport, Ky, 479 U.S. 92 (1986); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga, 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir. 1997); Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir. 1986); Hang On, Inc. v. City of Arlington, 65 F.3d 1248 (5th Cir. 1995); and South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v. City of Miami, 734 F.2d 608 (11th Cir. 1984), as well as studies conducted in other cities including, but not limited to, Garden Grove, California; Tucson, AZ; Seattle, Washington; Austin, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Indianapolis, Indiana; Houston, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona; Whittier, California; Amarillo, Texas; Cleveland, Ohio; and Los Angeles, California; findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On the Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Business (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the mayor and city council find that:
(1)
Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are historically uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that are likely to occur on their premises.
(2)
Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located. See, e.g., studies of the cities of Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Texas.
(3)
Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. See, e.g., California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972); See also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377.
(4)
Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77.
(5)
Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. See, e.g., Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986); see also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77.
(6)
At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. See, e.g., Study of Fort Myers, Florida.
(7)
For the period 1985 through 1995, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 523,056. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
(8)
As of December 1998, there have been 17,860 reported cases of AIDS in the state, and there were 15 cases reported in the county in 1999.
(9)
Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for HIV antibody test in the state.
(10)
The total number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported during the ten-year period 1985—1995 was 367,796. See e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
(11)
The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,250,581 cases reported during the period 1993-1995. See, e.g. Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
(12)
The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.
(13)
According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. See, e.g. Findings of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
(14)
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 3 77.
(15)
Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377.
(16)
The findings noted in paragraphs numbered (1) through (15) raise substantial governmental concerns.
(17)
Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
(18)
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
(19)
Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity that occurs in adult establishments.
(20)
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of a sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity.
(21)
It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, particularly the criminal history of such person, and to have information as to those who are likely to be witnesses to activity proscribed by this chapter.
(22)
The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter and the general laws governing such conduct.
(23)
The barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of ten (10) years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
(24)
The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
