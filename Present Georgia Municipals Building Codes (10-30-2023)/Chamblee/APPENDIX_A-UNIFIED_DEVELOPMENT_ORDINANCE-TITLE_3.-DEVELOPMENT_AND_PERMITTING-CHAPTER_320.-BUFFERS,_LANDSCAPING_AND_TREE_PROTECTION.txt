When making a determination of the type of trees to be affected within a development project the following criteria shall be referenced.
(1)
Specimen Tree:
a.
Any tree in fair or better condition, which equals or exceeds the following diameter sizes:
1.
Large Hardwoods Trees: 24-inches DBH or larger - such as oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, sweetgums, etc.
2.
Large Softwoods Trees: 30-inches DBH or larger - such as pines, deodar cedars, etc.
3.
Understory Trees: 4-inches DBH or larger- such as dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.
b.
A tree in fair or better condition must meet the following minimum standards:
1.
A life expectancy of greater than 15 years.
2.
A structurally sound trunk, not hollow and having no extensive decay, and less than 20 percent radial trunk dieback.
3.
No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only).
4.
No major insect or pathological problem.
c.
A lesser-sized tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is a rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical significance.
d.
A lesser size tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a landscape project.
e.
In order to encourage the conservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen trees, which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved would be counted one for one based on replacement and recompense DBH.
f.
The Critical Root Zone of Specimen Trees will be protected with hog-back/wire-back tree save fencing with metal support posts. See landscape details provided in Addendum 2.0.
(b)
Tree Stand:
(1)
A contiguous grouping of trees, which has been determined to be of high value in the opinion of the City Landscape Coordinator. Determination is based upon meeting any the following criteria:
a.
A relatively mature, even-aged stand.
b.
A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature.
c.
A stand of historical significance.
d.
A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality.
(c)
If a specimen tree is to be removed, a plan or written documentation authored by a RLA or ISA certified arborist indicating the reason for the removal must be submitted to the City Landscape Coordinator for approval.
(1)
Specimen trees that cannot be saved must be replaced with trees having an equal value to twice the DBH of the trees removed above and beyond minimum site DBH densities. Likewise, specimen trees saved may be counted as having an equal value to twice the DBH toward meeting minimum site DBH densities.
(2)
Specimen trees removed shall be replaced with a 2.5-inch tree caliper, by species with potentials for comparable size and quality. If applicant cannot determine specimen trees, the applicant is to hire an independent ISA certified arborist for determination and supply the results to the City Landscape Coordinator for approval.

Section 320-36. - Tree survey plan and inventory.
(a)
The Tree Survey Plan shall be in the form of a to-scale map or a site plan prepared and sealed by a registered surveyor, certified engineer or landscape architect noting the location of all specimen trees or stands of trees plus all other trees which will be preserved and counted toward meeting site density requirements. It should also include the following information:
(1)
All specimen trees and their critical root zones should be labeled, and must be shown on the survey and inventoried by size and species. This includes those specimen trees that are to be preserved as well as those proposed for removal.
(2)
The critical root zone of boundary trees that are located on neighboring properties whose critical route zone extends on to applicant's property shall be shown.
(3)
All other trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be shown on the survey and inventoried by size and species. Only trees with a DBH measurement of two inches or greater are to be identified as eligible for density compliance. Existing trees less than two inches DBH will not be counted toward Existing Density Factor.
(4)
Trees that measure less than 2" DBH, and thus can't be counted toward the density requirements, do not have to be counted and shown individually on the plan.
(5)
Sampling methods may be used to determine tree densities for forested areas over two (2) acres.
(6)
Show all areas of proposed land disturbance along with tree protection zones, tree save areas, and buffers with existing trees on the Survey.

Tree Replacement Plan standards and vegetation.
(1)
The last part of the Tree Removal Permit is the Tree Replacement Plan. This plan may be included as a part of the Tree Protection Plan or may be submitted as a separate drawing. The Tree Replacement Plan includes the planting schedules along with proposed tree names (botanical and common), quantity, size, spacing and any special planting notes. Unless otherwise approved by the City Landscape Coordinator, all trees selected for replanting must be on the City's Tree Species List, see Addendum 2.0.
(2)
Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability. Standards for transplanting should be in keeping with those established in the International Society of Arboriculture publication Tree and Shrub Planting Manual or similar publication. Reference the American Association of Nurserymen publication American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60, 1973) for plant material quality specifications. Reference the Manual of Woody Landscape Plants (Michael Dirr, 1983, Castle Books) or similar publication for information on tree species site requirements.
(3)
The Tree Replacement Plan should also reflect the following guidelines:
a.
Replanted trees shall be of the same or similar species as those removed when practical unless a change in species is appropriate to achieve the requirements of Subsection 320-3(c).
b.
The use of flowering ornamental trees or plants classified as large shrubs may be included in the Tree Replacement Plan, but shall not be used for the purpose of meeting the density calculations for the site unless approved by the City Landscape Coordinator.
c.
All overstory trees should be a minimum of eight (8) feet tall and have a trunk of not less than three (3.0) caliper inches. All understory trees should be a minimum of six (6) feet tall and have a trunk of not less than two (2.0) inches. In order to provide sufficient growing area for planted trees, the following minimum criteria must be observed unless otherwise approved by the City Landscape Coordinator:
1.
Overstory Trees - 200 square feet of pervious root zone.
2.
Understory Trees - 75 square feet of pervious root zone.
3.
Up to 30% of root zone may be impervious area except for parking lot islands).
d.
For new residential single-family detached dwellings, smaller caliper replacement trees shall be considered, provided the total minimum tree density goal is reached. A list of proposed plant species and sizes is to be submitted in writing to the City Landscape Coordinator.
e.
All planting and staking details should be provided on the plan. Examples of acceptable details are provided in Addendum 2.0.
f.
All debris from trees cut or substantially damaged should be removed from the site in a timely fashion including the removal of any portion of the tree stump above the original natural grade or elevation of land unless accepted by the City Landscape Coordinator for a specific reason such as, but not limited to, unusually large size or age.

Section 320-38. - Tree preservation and replacement requirements.
(a)
Existing tree cover and natural vegetation shall be preserved and/or replaced with suitable vegetation. All existing, healthy hardwood or softwood trees with a caliper of two or more inches at a point four and one-half feet above the ground shall be retained whenever feasible; if not feasible, the tree shall be replaced by the guidelines set forth in this article.
(b)
A minimum of one overstory tree shall be required for each 500 square feet of the total minimum required open space outside parking areas. For purposes of meeting this requirement, all existing, replaced or planted trees as defined in this article and all other existing trees of at least 20 feet in canopy diameter and height shall be counted. Trees required for screening purposes shall not be included in the aforementioned calculation.
(c)
Except as required by this section and to meet specific community design policies established for various areas of the city, trees shall be planted and/or retained in areas of the site to enhance the overall project design and provide such amenities as visual attractiveness, natural resources preservation, energy conservation, etc.
(d)
All retained or planted trees shall be protected or situated as to prevent damage from environmental changes, particularly grading and other contractor operations, resulting from any building or other improvements.
(e)
Overstory and understory trees identified in the Tree Species Selection List of Addendum 2.0, Buffer, Landscaping, and Tree Preservation Administrative Guidelines, shall be permitted in keeping with the tree species diversity requirements of Subsection 320-3(c).
(f)
Other trees may be approved on a case-by-case basis. The general criteria for overstory replacement trees are large growing (40 feet tall or greater), and ecologically compatible with the site. The general criteria for understory replacement trees are medium growing (ten to 35 feet in height), and ecologically compatible with the site. All planting and replanting plans are subject to the City Landscape Coordinator's approval.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17)
Section 320-39. - Tree density requirements.
(a)
The following tree density requirements are intended to supplement plantings where tree replacement is necessary to meet the minimum standards of the City of Chamblee:
(1)
Tree density factor. All applicable sites shall maintain a minimum tree density of 100 inches DBH per acre, except for existing single-family detached residential lots, which shall maintain a minimum of 50 inches DBH per acre.
(2)
An applicant for development or redevelopment is only required to plant additional trees to meet the minimum tree density requirements of this Article if the total tree density factor provided by the following provisions of the UDO does not exceed the minimum tree density factor:
a.
All existing trees retained on-site as per Section 320-36 and Section 320-38 (Not including public trees);
b.
Trees planted in landscape strips required in Section 320-20;
c.
Trees planted in parking lots as required in Section 320-21;
d.
Trees planted in landscape strips around parking structures required in Subsection 240-13(b)(39)g;
e.
Trees planted in landscaping around detention ponds as described in Subsection 340-38(c)(3)h;
f.
Trees planted in open space landscaping required in Subsection 320-38(b);
g.
Trees planted in no-access easements required in Section 320-22; and
h.
Trees planted in buffers required in Section 320-12.
(3)
Specimen Tree(s) located outside of the buildable area (i.e.; within the setbacks where building should not be occurring) must be preserved with less than 20% disturbance of their critical root zones.
(4)
The site minimum DBH density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. Occasionally, this density cannot be met because a project site will not bear the required density of trees. To provide some alternatives in such cases, two (2) alternative methods of compliance may, at the discretion of the City Landscape Coordinator, be approved: planting at a location remote from the project site; or, contribution to the City of Chamblee Tree Bank Fund, as provided in Subsection 320-40(c).
(5)
The City Landscape Coordinator and the Planning and Development Department must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance will more than eighty percent (80%) of the required site density be met through alternative compliance.
(6)
A minimum of 20% or as many trees that can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question. No permit will be issued until the City Landscape Coordinator and Planning and Development Department have approved the request and received the necessary documentation and/or funds.
(7)
Minimum site DBH density shall be calculated and established using the procedure described in this Section 320-39. The inches per acre calculation shall be based on the net site areas, excluding any detention ponds, lakes, stream buffers, floodplain areas and permanent easements where planting is prohibited. Non-specimen sized trees saved with less than 30% CRZ impact providing DBH in excess of the required minimum site DBH located within the building setback limits, may count toward the specimen recompense on an inch-for-inch basis.
(8)
Trees replanted to achieve density requirements should be selected from the Tree Species Selection List found in Addendum 2.0 and shall meet the requirements of Subsection 320-3(c). In addition, replanting should be at the ratio of not less than one overstory tree for every three understory tree. Density credit may be met by planting all overstory trees, but not by planting only understory trees.
(9)
All reasonable efforts shall be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable efforts include, but are not limited to, alteration of building design; alternate location of building, parking area, water retention, drainage pipes; or relocation of utilities. Administrative authority is granted to the Planning and Development Director to approve minor variances for development designed to save tree stands and specimen trees pursuant to Section 280-37.
