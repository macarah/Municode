The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish minimum standards governing the use, occupancy, condition and maintenance of property, dwellings, buildings, and structures. Left completely unregulated, the failure to properly maintain property can become a threat to public safety and a detriment to property values and to the city's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of Chamblee in enacting this article is as follows:
(1)
To protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to implement the policies and objectives of a comprehensive property management plan throughout the city through the enactment of a comprehensive set of regulations governing property maintenance in the city;
(2)
To preserve the value of property and maintain for the city's residents, workers and visitors a safe and aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interest of the city;
(3)
To establish minimum standards governing supplied utilities and facilities and other physical things and conditions essential to make dwellings, buildings and structures and surrounding premises safe, sanitary and fit for human use and habitation;
(4)
To establish minimum standards governing the use, occupancy, condition and maintenance of property, dwellings, buildings, and structures;
(5)
To promote and protect the public health and safety through the control of weeds and grass which constitute a fire hazard and a public nuisance;

To fix certain responsibilities and duties of owners, operators and occupants of dwellings;
(7)
To provide for the condemnation of buildings and structures deemed unfit for human use and habitation and provide for removal of such buildings at public expense after hearing;

(c)
Where repairs, alterations, construction, maintenance and work required to meet the provisions of this article are regulated and/or required to be permitted by other ordinances, such repairs, alterations, construction, maintenance and work shall comply with all provisions of this code.

Sec. 18-126. - Official identification of property maintained in blighted condition.
(a)
In order for a parcel of real property to be officially designated as maintained in a blighted condition and subject to increased taxation, the following steps must be completed:
(1)
An inspection must be performed on the parcel of property. In order for an inspection to be performed:
a.
A request may be made by the public officer or by at least five residents of the city for inspection of a parcel of property, said inspection to be based on the criteria as delineated by ordinance; or
b.
The public officer may cause a survey of existing conditions to be performed, or may refer to any such survey conducted or finalized within the previous five years, to locate or identify any parcels that may be in a blighted condition and for which a full inspection should be conducted to determine if that parcel of property meets the criteria set out in this section for designation as being maintained in a blighted condition.
(2)
A written inspection report of the findings for any parcel of property inspected pursuant to subsection (1) above shall be prepared and submitted to the public officer. Where feasible, photographs of the conditions found to exist on the property on the date of inspections shall be made and will supplement the inspection report.

Following completion of the inspection report, the building official shall make a determination, in writing, that a property is maintained in a blighted condition, as defined by this section, and is subject to increase taxation.
(4)
Said inspection report and supporting documents will be reviewed by the planning and development director for confirmation and approval of all findings and recommendations by the building official and concurrence that the property identified meets the definition of blighted area as defined under this section. At that point, the mayor and city council shall be notified in writing of the determination of blighted condition.
(5)
The building official shall cause a written notice of his/her determination that the real property at issue is being maintained in a blighted condition to be served upon the person(s) shown on the most recent tax digest of DeKalb County as responsible for payment of ad valorem taxes assessed thereon and parties in interest; provided, however, where through the existence of reasonable diligence it becomes known to the public officer that real property has been sold or conveyed since publication of the most recent tax digest, written notice shall be given to the person(s) known or reasonably believed to then own the property or be chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes thereon, at the best address available. Service in the manner set forth at O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12 shall constitute sufficient notice to the property's owner or person chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes for purpose of this section, except that posting of the notice on the property will not be required.
(b)
The written notice given to the person(s) chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes and parties in interest shall notify such person and parties in interest of the building official's determination that the real property is being maintained in a blighted condition and shall advise such person and parties in interest of the hours and location at which the person may inspect and copy the building official's determination and any supporting documentation.

Written request for hearing shall be filed with the planning and development director. Upon receipt of a request for appeal hearing, the planning and development director shall notify the city manager and city clerk.
(c)
Within 30 days of the receipt of a request for an appeal hearing, the planning and development director shall set a date, time and location for the hearing and shall give at least ten business days' notice to the person(s) and/or parties in interest requesting the hearing and the city manager. Hearings may be continued upon request of any party, for good cause.
(d)
At the hearing, the public officer shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject property is maintained in a blighted condition, as defined by this section. Upon hearing from the public officer and/or their witnesses and the person(s) or parties in interest requesting the hearing and/or their witnesses, the mayor and city council shall make a determination either affirming or reversing the determination of the public officer. The determination shall be in writing and copies thereof shall be served on the parties by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery. The determination by the mayor and city council shall be deemed final. A copy of such determination shall be served upon the City of Chamblee Finance Director and the Tax Commissioner of DeKalb County, who shall include the increased tax on the next regular tax bill rendered on behalf of the city.
(e)
Persons aggrieved by the determination of the mayor and city council affirming the determination of the public officer may petition the Superior Court of DeKalb County for a writ of certiorari, within 30 days of issuance of the city council's written determination.

(a)
Real property which has had its designation as maintained in a blighted condition removed by the public officer, shall be eligible for a decrease in the rate of city ad valorem taxation by applying a factor of 0.5 to the city millage rate applied to the property, so that such property shall be taxed at a lower millage rate than the millage rate generally applied in the municipality or otherwise provided by general law; such decreased rate of taxation shall be applied beginning with the next tax bill rendered following removal of official designation of a real property as blighted. The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depending on the amount of cost expended by the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every $40,000.00 or portion thereof equaling one year of tax reduction; provided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in city ad valorem taxes for more than three successive years.
