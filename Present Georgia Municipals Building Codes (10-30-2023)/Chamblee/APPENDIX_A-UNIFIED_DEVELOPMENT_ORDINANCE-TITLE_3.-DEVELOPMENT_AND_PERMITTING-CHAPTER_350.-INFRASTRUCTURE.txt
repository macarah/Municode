(a)
Intent. It is the intent of this Article to build streets that are integral components of community design. Streets shall be detailed to complement neighborhoods and commercial centers and shall be pedestrian in scale.
(b)
Street Classifications.
(1)
For purposes of this Unified Development Ordinance, all of the public streets, roads and highways in the City except where otherwise noted, are classified as boulevard, primary, secondary, feeder, or local streets, as shown on the Streetscapes and Gateways Map of the appendix.
(2)
In addition, to the road classification certain streets are also designated on the Streetscapes and Gateways Map as storefront streets. Storefront streets are designed to provide access to local businesses for pedestrians and bicycles over vehicular through-put and as such buildings along such roadways are required to meet the provision of Section 230-29, Storefront Streets.
(3)
Street improvements. Streets, shall be constructed or improved to the standards as established in this UDO, or as otherwise required by the City Council.
(c)
Relationship to State Road Construction Standards.
(1)
All state-maintained roads and intersections shall comply with the standards and specifications of the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT). All new roads and intersections which are to be state-maintained shall be constructed to meet those standards.
(2)
GDOT standards are based on the Federal Highway Administration Functional Classification System, which are separate from the street classification established by the City of Chamblee.
(3)
Work done within the State rights-of-way is subject to review and approval by both GDOT and the City of Chamblee.
(4)
All of the materials, methods of construction, and workmanship for the work covered in reference to street construction shall conform to the latest specifications of the Georgia Department of Transportation, "Design Policy Manual," latest edition. Exceptions may be made for pedestrian crosswalk and sidewalk materials, which may vary according to the overall design and character of the development.
(d)

(a)
Driveways.
(1)
Driveways and curb cuts shall meet the following criteria:
a.
Interior driveway. Where 90-degree parking is utilized, all interior driveways shall be a minimum of 22 feet in width. If 45- or 60-degree angle parking is used, then interior driveways shall be at least 12 feet in width for one-way traffic and 22 feet in width for two-way traffic. Where parallel parking is utilized or there is no parking, interior driveways shall be a minimum of ten feet in width for one-way traffic and 20 feet in width for two-way traffic.
b.
All sidewalk paving materials shall be continued across any intervening driveway at the same prevailing grade and cross slope as on the adjacent sidewalk clear zone. A corresponding interior sign or painted bar on the driveway shall be provided adjacent to the sidewalk paving as it intersects the driveway which shall communicate that vehicles must stop or yield for the intervening sidewalk.
c.
Driveway widths shall be a maximum of 24 feet for two-way entrances or shared driveways, and 20 feet for one-way entrances, unless otherwise permitted by the City of Chamblee Public Works Department or state department of transportation. Residential driveways shall be limited to a maximum of 20 feet in width in the right of way. Apron may be flared up to an additional two feet on either side.
d.
Driveway curb cuts shall not be permitted on any street that is classified as a boulevard, primary, secondary, or feeder street when access may be provided from a side or rear local street located immediately adjacent to a contiguous property, with the exception of hotel patron drop-off drives.
e.
Driveways and drive aisles are not permitted between the sidewalk and a building and shall be perpendicular to any adjacent street.
f.
No more than one curb cut shall be permitted for each development, provided that properties with more than one street frontage may have one curb cut located on each street frontage. However, developments on properties with a single street frontage greater than 400 feet shall be permitted two curb cuts along one street frontage.
g.
A shared driveway serving two or more adjoining lots may be authorized by the Planning and Development Director based on the application of the following criteria:
1.
The shared driveway is desired to improve traffic safety and operations.
2.
The shared driveway is necessary in order to provide for reasonable use and development of property due to its size, shape, topography or hydrology.
3.
The shared driveway has environmental benefits such as the minimization of impervious surface and the protection of mature vegetation in areas with environmental constraints, such as steep slopes, sub-surface rock, floodplain, and stream buffers or other similar characteristics that would be impacted with the construction of multiple driveways.
4.
Ownership of the shared driveway can be established to provide for the perpetual maintenance and repair of the shared driveway in an equitable way that does not encumber the City of Chamblee.
5.
Construction standards for the shared driveway will meet or exceed the standards of construction of Sections 350-2 and 350-5.

  b.
Spacing shall be measured from centerline to centerline of driveways or streets. Greater separation may be required for safe operation of intersections and right or left turning lanes. Whenever possible, proposed driveways along one side of a street shall coincide with existing or proposed driveways on the opposite side of such street. If offset driveways cannot be avoided, the same driveway spacing criteria as given in Table 350.1 should be provided. Spacing shall be measured from centerline to centerline. If the street involved is a divided facility and the driveways do not align with a median crossover, the driveway spacing would only apply to the adjacent driveway on the same side of the street as provided in Table 350.1.
c.
Maximum number of driveways serving a single project: one for each 400' of property frontage, or fraction thereof per street, along a Boulevard, Primary or Secondary Street.
d.
No new curb cut, driveway, or private street intersection shall be permitted on a street classified as a Feeder, Secondary, Primary or Boulevard without the approval of the Planning and Development Director, if it is within 50 feet of an existing driveway or street intersection.
(b)
No-access easements along thoroughfares where driveways are discouraged. Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way which could control or are intended to control access to streets, alleys, or public lands shall not be permitted unless their control is given to the City under ownership, dedication or easement conditions approved by the City Attorney or acceptable to the Planning and Development Director, and the access to abutting properties is provided by an alley, see Subsection 300-12(d), Double frontage or reverse frontage lots. No development shall be designed so as to deny access to abutting properties. See Section 320-22 for landscape requirements within the no-access easement.
(c)
Requirements for interparcel access. To the maximum extent possible, sidewalks and parking lots serving adjacent lots shall be interconnected to provide continuous driveway connections and pedestrian connections between adjoining lots and streets, except that this requirement shall not apply to lots zoned for single-family residential units. In all cases, access easements shall be provided to accommodate continuous access and egress routes connecting commercial, office, and multifamily lots, now or in the future. If interparcel access is implemented after the initial site development, any deficiencies created to formalize the connection are permitted without need for any formal relief through the variance process (e.g.; removing a required parking space to accommodate the connection will render it nonconforming but is permitted to prioritize interparcel connectivity).
(d)
Gates and security arms shall be prohibited from crossing any public street or sidewalk.

Section 350-52. - Procedures.
(a)
Installation of street and pedestrian lights. The installation and operation of lighting fixtures located within the rights-of-way of any public street, road, highway, sidewalk or alley in the unincorporated areas of the City or fixed to any pole, lamppost, standard or other supporting device which is located within such rights-of-way, will comply the following procedures:
(1)
Plans and specifications for the proposed installation showing compliance with the standards in this Section shall be submitted to the Planning and Development Director for approval. No installations will be made without this approval.
(2)
Roadway or street lighting luminaries or fixtures installed within the public rights-of-way as "security lights" or for the purpose of lighting areas other than the public streets shall require the approval of the Planning and Development Director thereof before installation of such lights.
(3)
Fixtures for illuminating areas adjoining the public streets, roads, and the like, such as parking areas and driveways, shall be mounted in such a manner as to ensure that the light pattern is kept off the public roadway. When street or roadway lighting luminaries are to be used for security lighting, they will be mounted on the side of the pole that is opposite from the public street and will be mounted to ensure that the lateral light distribution pattern is parallel to the street and the vertical light distribution at the initial light source is perpendicular to the street.
(4)
If lighting fixtures of a type other than those in the classification of street or roadway luminaries are to be used or if the proposed lighting is to be installed outside of public rights-of-way, the plans and specifications submitted will be sufficiently detailed to clearly show that such shall be installed and operated in such a manner to prevent glare from being a hazard to or interfering with the normal use of the public rights-of-way.
(b)
Street lights for new subdivisions.
(1)
Prior to the approval of a Final Plat, the developer shall submit and prepare a street light design drawn on the approved Preliminary Plat based upon the requirements of this UDO. The design shall be forwarded to the appropriate power provider and the developer shall pay the power provider the appropriate cost for materials and installation. Proof of payment to the power provider shall be required.
(2)
All fixtures and poles shall meet the specification requirements of the City pursuant to the specification in Section 350-54 and all maintenance shall be the responsibility of the power provider. The City, in addition to other requirements, may require a light to be located at street intersections within the development.
(3)
Upon acceptance of the street light installation by the City, the power provider shall submit monthly bills to the Planning and Development Director for payment. The City shall assign a special assessment to each property abutting a street with street lights for payment of the monthly utility costs in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter 350, Article 4 of the UDO.
(c)
Street Light Request Process for Existing Public Streets. This policy follows the standard City process for citizen response to provide uniformity and ensure responsiveness and accountability.
(1)
Requests for new street lights and/or changes in existing street lights on existing streets must be made in writing to the Public Works Director. Requests should include the primary concern and an individual contact person for follow up. Requests will be logged into the City's tracking system and included on the list of street light requests.
(2)
When an organized group is active, i.e., homeowners association (HOA), civic association or other, the request shall be submitted by that entity. If no formal group exists, the request may be made by an individual or group of individuals.
(3)
Requests for street light changes may include, but are not limited to, the following:
a.
Additional/fewer lights;
b.
Rearrangement of lights;
c.
Refurbishing of lights.
(4)
Upon receipt of the street light request, a field inspection may be conducted by City staff to determine the existing lighting conditions including number of street lights, locations, spacing, fixture types, poles, and any other pertinent information. An inspection may take place at night hours if deemed necessary.
(5)
Findings are documented and the results are presented to the Planning and Development Director for direction. As directed by the Planning and Development Director, the Director shall notify the identified contact person of the findings and recommendations.
(6)
If installation is recommended, the community shall circulate a petition to the impacted neighboring property owners. The impacted neighboring property owners are defined as any property owner that has all or a portion of their property within a 250-foot radius of a requested street light modification. The requestor must obtain approval of at least 65% of the property owners petitioned unless a single light is requested, at which point 100% of the property owners must be in favor of the additional street light. All properties in the impacted area must be contacted. If a property owner does not respond, it will be counted as a no vote. If a safety problem can be documented, the Director will recommend to the Planning and Development Director to waive the petition process.
(7)
Once the petition is verified, a map shall be drawn of the area showing any existing street lighting.
(8)
Contact shall be made by City staff with the power utility provider and a meeting shall take place, if necessary, to discuss various options. The power utility provider shall later supply their recommendations and estimated costs, including installation and monthly billings, to City staff.
(9)
The map shall be updated to show proposed lighting and submitted to the Planning and Development Director with all supporting documentation for review. The street light request will be implemented at the direction of the Planning and Development Director.
(d)
Appeal of decisions. Should the Planning and Development Director thereof disapprove the request to install or operate lighting fixtures within any public right-of-way, he shall communicate the disapproval in writing to the party requesting the same. The written communication shall include the specific reasons for disapproval. Any appeal of a light or lighting system decision would follow the procedures outlined in Section 280-15.
