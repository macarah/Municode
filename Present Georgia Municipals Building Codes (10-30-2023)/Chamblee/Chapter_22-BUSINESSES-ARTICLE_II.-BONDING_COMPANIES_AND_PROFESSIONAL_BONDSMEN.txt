Footnotes:
--- (3) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 378, adopted Oct. 8, 1993, set out provisions codified, at the editor's discretion, as superseding the former Ch. 22, Art. II, which pertained to bonding companies and derived from the Code of 1982, §§ 9-5-1—9-5-11.
State Law reference— Persons deemed professional bondsmen, O.C.G.A. § 17-6-50; unlawful for elected official, officer of the court, law enforcement officer or attorney to engage in bail bond business, O.C.G.A. § 45-11-8.

Sec. 22-26. - Authority to approve bonding business.
(a)
A certificate of authority ("certificate") is required for any and all individuals, corporations or other legal entities wishing to engage in the bonding business in the city. This certificate is renewable annually unless the applicant has defaulted under this article, ceases to be in good standing or has violated other general federal and state laws applicable to either the entity or to any individual involved with the applicant or the bonding business itself. No person or business shall commence to do business or continue to do business in the city without a valid certificate of authority.
(b)
Within the context of these requirements and as defined by state law, a "professional bondsperson" is one who holds him or herself out as a signer of surety of bonds for compensation (O.C.G.A. § 17-6-50). The requirements contained in this article shall in no way lessen the requirements placed upon professional bondspersons under state law. A certificate of authority will be issued annually by the police department to those applicants meeting the requirements contained herein and a professional bondsperson shall be authorized to write surety bonds in the city only upon issuance of a certificate of authority and upon maintaining that certificate in force. A professional bondsperson shall not be authorized to directly write bonds in the city at any time while his, her or its certificate of authority is suspended or revoked.
(c)
An "applicant" can be an individual, trust, a group of individuals, whether or not formed as a partnership or other legal entity, a corporation or a combination of individuals, trusts and corporations. An applicant can and often is the same as a bondsperson.
(d)
All employees, agents, applicable creditors and other individuals or entities described in these regulations are required to complete, swear to and file a professional bondsperson application form with the city police department.
(e)
All certificates must be prominently displayed in the business location of the applicant.
(f)
All applications must be accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee of $100.00 to cover costs of investigation and all applications must be accompanied by a fee of $25.00 for each person required to submit a professional bondsperson application. Each renewal application and all additional professional bondsperson applications must be accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee of $25.00 each.
(g)
Bondsman shall be deemed to include the term bondsperson and can include a natural person or a corporation.
(h)
Certificates of authority are nontransferable.

All new applicants who submit applications in order to start doing business in the city, in addition to all of the other requirements found in these regulations for doing business in the city, must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the chief of police that there exists a need in the city for additional bonding businesses and that the operation of an additional bonding business will not be an administrative burden to the city or to the police department.
(Ord. No. 378, 10-8-93; Ord. No. 390, 2-11-94)
Sec. 22-29. - Same—Financial.
(a)
All new applicants applying for a certificate of authority to do business in the city, as a professional bonds person, must individually, or as an officer or agent of the operating entity, place on deposit, in an escrow account in a banking institution located in the city, approved by the chief of police, not less than $4,000.00 in cash or cash equivalent. This escrow account shall be set up so that the funds contained therein shall be made immediately payable by the depository to the city for any unsatisfied forfeiture which may be due and payable to the city 30 days subsequent to the entry of judgment on the general execution docket. The chief of police, or his designated agent, shall be the sole signatory on said escrow account and such funds shall not be available for the general use of any applicant. In no event shall the escrow account be less than $4,000.00.
(b)
The chief of police shall notify an applicant in writing of any unpaid forfeited bond amount and, within five days of receipt of such notice, such applicant must liquidate such outstanding obligations. Failing to do so within this time period shall entitle the chief of police to withdraw the amount from the escrow account. Failure of the applicant to maintain the escrow account at the required funding level shall be grounds for suspension of their right to make bond in the city. The time frame for such action is as follows: Within 30 days after withdrawal of funds from such escrow account, such certificate shall be suspended if such account has not been reestablished to the level required in this article. After such period of time, the applicant's certificate of authority shall be permanently revoked and the applicant will have to make new application in order to do business in the city.
(c)
Such business entity must present annual proof of a current business license.
(d)
All applicants will be required to remain in good standing with respect to all applicable state and federal laws governing doing business. A violation of such applicable laws, such as tax laws, will result in suspension or revocation of an applicant's certificate.
(Ord. No. 378, 10-8-93; Ord. No. 390, 2-11-94)

Further, no bonding business or agent acting on behalf of a bonding business shall be permitted to accept any funds in addition to those fees authorized by law for the performance of their services. Nor shall anyone accept from the principal on the bond or from anyone on his behalf, any sums with respect to the issuance or continuance of a bail bond on his behalf. Violation will cause the certificate of authority of the bonding business involved to be immediately revoked.

Periodic reports may be requested on a quarterly basis and, if so requested, will be due by the fifteenth day of the month following the applicable quarter, i.e., April 15 for the January through March quarter, etc. These statements shall be sworn to by a corporate officer or the individual submitting them, or may be signed by a certified public accountant. (Facsimile signatures are not acceptable on any application or reports required for a certificate of authority or to renew a certificate of authority.)
(b)
These reports shall also include a list of all bonds in force as of the application date and as of each reporting date, if not an original application, and the known current status of each obligation shall be submitted with the application and periodic quarterly or annual reports, and shall be submitted as heretofore required or more frequently as may be determined by the chief of police and will be due 15 days subsequent to written notice of such request other than those already required herein. The nature and amount of bonds will be considered in conjunction with these financial reports of an applicant or approved bonding business as well as the current escrow balance in order to ascertain bonding limitations of the respective businesses. Generally, a bonding business shall be limited from writing more than five times the face value of their escrow account.

Sec. 22-32. - Reissuance of certificates of authority.
Violations of the regulations contained herein or as later amended and promulgated will cause the certificate of authority to be suspended or revoked.

An applicant wishing to again be approved as a professional bondsperson subsequent to a revocation or suspension must make a new application, as contained herein, indicating the current status of bonds in force at the time of new application and current status of bonds subject to forfeiture at the time of the new application. Furthermore, any information with respect to violations of this article or violation of other state or federal law will be investigated by the chief of police and such information will be directed to either the city solicitor's office or the district attorney's office, as the case may be, for further investigation and criminal prosecution whenever it appears that there has been a violation of Georgia law or this article.
