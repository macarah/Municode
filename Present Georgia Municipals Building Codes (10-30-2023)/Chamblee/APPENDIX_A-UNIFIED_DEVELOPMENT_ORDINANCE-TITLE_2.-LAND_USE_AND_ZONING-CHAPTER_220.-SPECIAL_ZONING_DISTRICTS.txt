To encourage property owners to improve and renovate existing housing stock rather than demolish the same; and
(4)
To establish and maintain a balance between preserving the character of mature neighborhoods while accommodating compatible new residential development; and
(5)
To allow neighborhoods an opportunity to establish architectural standards that will preserve the character of their existing neighborhoods.
(b)
Scope of regulations. This division establishes standards and procedures that apply to demolition, new construction, and residential development in whole or in part within any area of the City that is designated a Neighborhood Preservation Overlay district.
