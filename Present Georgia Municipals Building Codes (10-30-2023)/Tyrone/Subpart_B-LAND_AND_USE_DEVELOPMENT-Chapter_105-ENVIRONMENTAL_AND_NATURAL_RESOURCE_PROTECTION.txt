Chapter 105 - ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 105-1. - Wetlands Protection District.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
The wetlands in the town are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality, maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state.
(2)
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
(3)
The purpose of this section is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.
(b)
Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps for the Town of Tyrone, Georgia.
Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended.
Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act.
Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.
(c)
Establishment of the wetlands protection district.
(1)
The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the town that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps. This map shall be referred to as the "generalized wetlands map" and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this section, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
(2)
The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the town and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this section does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(d)
Protection criteria; requirement for local permit or permission. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the town. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the [building official or authorized local government representative] using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
(e)
Permitted uses. The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the wetlands protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. The activities listed in this section are exempted from section 404 regulations, provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual permit 404 permit. However, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances:
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would required an individual 404 permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(4)
The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture.

Sec. 105-2. - Water Supply Watershed Protection District.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the town and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
(2)
The purpose of this section is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the town, to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This section shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the town.
(b)
Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this subsection, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Buffer means a natural or enhanced vegetated area with no or limited minor land-disturbances, such as trails and picnic areas, located adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed.
Corridor means all land within the buffer areas established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed and within other setback areas specified in subsection (d) of this section.
Impervious surface means a manmade structure or surface that prevents the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools, or patios.
Large water supply watershed means a watershed containing 100 square miles or more of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake.
Perennial stream means a stream that flows throughout the whole year as indicated on a U.S. Geodetic Survey quad map.
Reservoir boundary means the edge of a water supply reservoir defined by its normal pool level.
Small water supply watershed means a watershed that contains less than 100 square miles of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake.
Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government.
Water supply reservoir means a governmentally owned impoundment of water for the primary purpose of providing water to one or more governmentally owned public drinking water systems. This excludes the multipurpose reservoirs owned by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers.
Water supply/watershed means the area of land upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water intake.
(c)
Establishment of a water supply watershed district.

ARTICLE II. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION

Sec. 105-23. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Groundwater recharge area (synonymous with aquifer recharge area) means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer.
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities.
Pollution susceptibility maps means maps prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential.
Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.

(Code 1984, § 6-4-206; Ord. No. 379, 6-4-2001)
Sec. 105-25. - Title, findings and objectives.
(a)
Title of article. This article shall be known as the "Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of the Town of Tyrone, Georgia."
(b)
Finding of fact.
(1)
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the town, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the town relies on as a source of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas.
(2)
Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(c)
Objectives. The objectives of this article are:
(1)
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(2)
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
(3)
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.
(Code 1984, § 6-4-201; Ord. No. 379, 6-4-2001)
Sec. 105-26. - Establishment of a groundwater recharge area district.

In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5); provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division, except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(4)
Upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the town shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the town to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the town, and any variances required have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required, has been obtained. The town shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the town with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
(5)
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits (either in this or any other jurisdiction), this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
(6)
The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of a government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.
(c)
Plan requirements.
(1)
Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 105-57 or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the Stakeholder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20.
(2)
Data required for the site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted.
(d)

Sec. 105-57. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions of this section shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in this subsection (b) and subsection (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or issuing authority or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section, or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection (b)(2) shall not apply to any land-disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit, and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection (c)(9), a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent properties and waters beyond the levels specified in this section;
(15)
Except as provided in subsection (16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented, or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection (15). The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed;
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; they cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
(e)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

(a)
Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank.
(2)
An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
(3)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
(b)
Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the town manager or his designee finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the mayor and town council of the town may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
(2)
Except as provided above, the mayor and town council of the town shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the mayor and town council shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the town. The town shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
(3)
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
b.
Unusual circumstances where strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the article would create an extreme hardship.
(4)
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
(5)
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
a.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
b.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
c.
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
e.
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
f.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
g.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and
h.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
(6)
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
a.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
b.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
c.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion;
d.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
e.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and
f.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment;
g.
It is noted that Line Creek and Trickum Creek are of great significance to the county as drinking water sources. Therefore, this factor and its relationship to these two streams will be considered in all requests as to whether to grant a variance along either of these two streams.

The zoning administrator shall maintain and file with the town clerk a complete listing of the location and identifying features of all specimen trees. General criteria for the determination of specimen trees are:
(1)
Any deciduous tree with a diameter of 24 inches or greater.
(2)
Any coniferous tree with a diameter of 30 inches or greater.

Sec. 105-120. - Violation and penalty.
Any person, firm or corporation violating a provision of this article shall be deemed guilty of an offense. As a condition of suspension of any fine or sentence, the court may require payment of restitution or impose other punishment allowed by law which may include mandatory attendance at an educational program concerning tree preservation. Each day's continuance of a violation may be considered a separate offense. Each tree cut, damaged or poisoned shall constitute a separate offense.

(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-032), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-121. - Purpose.
(a)
The guiding presumption behind this article is the belief that the natural environment has significant value in and of itself, and that all reasonable measures available should be used in the preservation of that environment, consistent with the continued development of a viable town. The purpose of this article is to promote the preservation of existing tree canopy and tree specimen diversity within the town and preserve the aesthetic quality of land during and after development. Such preservation shall protect and enhance the town's urban greenery through tree protection and planting of trees and landscaping during land development of all property, public and private. Benefits associated with these regulations are reduced soil erosion, stormwater management costs and flooding potential; moderation of microclimates; improved air and water quality; mitigation of noise and glare; energy conservation through reduced heating and cooling costs; and enhanced property values. These benefits are heightened by the scenic and psychological values associated with the tree cover and are consistent with the town's emphasis on rural character.
(b)
The town council, therefore, declares it to be public policy to:
(1)
Aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance by contributing to the process of air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge, and stormwater runoff retardation, while at the same time aiding in noise, glare, and heat abatement;
(2)
Assist in providing adequate light and air by preventing overcrowding of land;
(3)
Provide visual buffering and enhance beautification of the town;
(4)
Safeguard and attempt to enhance property values and, in so doing, protect private and public investment,
(5)
Preserve, protect and further the unique identity and environment of the town, and, thereby, preserve the economic base attracted to the town by such factors;
(6)
Recognize that the protection and enhancement of the natural beauty, environment, and greenspace within the town contributes to the economy, as well as provide a truly necessary aesthetic balance to the development of an urban setting;
(7)
Conserve an ever-dwindling supply of energy, by the preservation and enhancement of the natural environment;
(8)
Protect the atmosphere, lands, and water from pollution, impairment or unnecessary destruction;
(9)
Protect natural vegetation except where its removal is necessary for responsible property development or control of disease and infestation. This article shall serve to dissuade the unnecessary clearing of land and its disturbance, so as to preserve, insofar as possible, the natural and existing growth of vegetation, and to replace whenever possible the removed foliage with new vegetation;
(10)
Protect vegetation within the intermediate regional floodplain and for a minimum of ten feet from the banks of those streams not having defined intermediate regional floodplain elevation contours, so as to assist in the retention of stormwater runoff and the control of erosion, including particularly the protection of stream bank stability by vegetation protection or restoration;
(11)
Preserve protected and "specimen" trees or stands of trees which are exceptional representatives of their species either in terms of size, age or unusual botanical quality, and encourage the good care of same through properly applied forestry practices;
(12)
Protect and supplement existing vegetation within greenbelts, open space, recreation areas and protected area where feasible;
(13)
Establish and maintain the maximum amount of tree cover on public and private property in the town by prohibiting destruction and removal of trees except in accordance with standards herein set forth as well as requiring the planting of trees on all development sites to achieve a specified minimum tree cove;
(14)
Maintain trees in the town in a healthy and nonhazardous condition through adoption and enforcement of professional arboricultural practices;
(15)
Establish, and revise as necessary, standards for planting and maintaining trees designed to improve the town's economic base by improving property values, enhancing the town's visual quality and its neighborhoods, and improving public health by reducing air pollution and the incidence of flooding;
(16)
Structure a tree density calculation method that favors the preservation of existing trees as opposed to replanting with smaller nursery stock; and
(17)
Strongly encourage the use of native plant materials to preserve the heritage of the town's natural beauty and promote best practices for water usage.

DIVISION 2. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT

Sec. 105-149. - Enforcement; inspections.
The town manager shall enforce this article, and may withhold issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or permits and inspections, for any development as required until the provisions of this article have been fully met.
(1)
Pre-construction inspection. Prior to issuance of a permit for clearing, grubbing and grading, site development or road construction, the town engineer shall inspect all tree inspection devices for compliance with the approved plans. Failure to adhere to this article will subject the owner and/or developer to enforcement procedures provided in this article.
(2)
Construction inspection. During construction, the town engineer will periodically inspect all projects to assure the adequacy of tree protection fencing. Failure to adhere to town standards for tree protection shall constitute ordinance noncompliance and shall subject the owner and/or developer to enforcement procedures provided in the tree preservation regulations.
(3)
Final inspection.
a.
Prior to the release of the project for final platting or certificate of occupancy, or other form of acceptance by the town, the town engineer shall inspect the project for compliance with all requirements of this article. Any disturbances in tree save areas or deficiencies in the required site density standard will be sited at this time. Tree save area disturbances and/or site density standard deficiencies must be corrected with new tree plantings prior to project release.
b.
Existing trees which are not expected to survive will not be credited toward fulfilling site density standards. Conversely, any existing trees not shown to remain on plans but which have been preserved (meeting all tree preservation standards) through field adjustments, may be so credited, provided that all such adjustments are properly recorded on the approved plans on file at town hall.
(4)
Maintenance inspection.
a.
One full growing season following the date if inspection of newly-planted trees, the town engineer shall inspect all trees on the project site. Any trees planted to meet the required site density standard which are dead, or nearly dead, shall be replaced. Trees preserved to meet the required site density which are dead, or nearly dead, shall be replaced whenever the loss of such trees due to construction-related injury is evident. The owner of the project or property at the time of the maintenance inspection shall be responsible for compliance with this article.
b.
Trees used to fulfill site density standards of this article shall be maintained for two years following the date of final approval of the project. The property owner shall maintain the required site density. The developer or builder shall be responsible for identifying newly planted trees to the homeowner or tenant, as well as informing the homeowner or tenant of proper tree maintenance procedures.
c.
Any trees required to be replaced as a result of this inspection shall be planted within 30 days of receipt of notification by the current owner. New tree plantings may be postponed for up to six months by posting of a performance bond in the amount of 110 percent of the planting cost. Failure to plant new trees in accordance with the provisions of this article will constitute ordinance noncompliance, and may subject the owner to civil penalties.
(5)
Issuance of certificate of occupancy.
a.
All trees used to fulfill the site density standard shall be planted prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy (C.O.).
b.
Upon final installation of newly planted trees in compliance with this article, and following acceptance by the town manager, the owner shall warrant the new trees and provide for the replacement of those that do not survive for a minimum period of two years.
c.

Applications for permits under this article shall submit tree planting specifications. Generally, these specifications shall conform to those established by the International Society of Arboriculture, as included in the Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual, latest addition, or similar publication.
(1)
Tree species selected for replacement plantings shall consist of an appropriate mix of trees species native to the region.
(2)
Trees shall not be planted within 20 feet of any structure or within ten feet of a paved driveway.
(3)
The National Arbor Day Foundation (NADF) recommends that conifers (evergreens) be planted close together on the northwestern and northern perimeters of buildings to buffer structures from northern winter winds.
(4)
NAFD recommends that deciduous (broadleaf) canopy trees be planted along the southwestern and eastern perimeters of buildings to shade structures in the summer and allow sunlight to pass through in the winter.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-011), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-252. - Determination of specimen trees or stands of trees; density credit.
(a)
Criteria. Specimen trees are characterized by the following minimum standards:
(1)
Any tree equaling or exceeding the following diameter sizes:
a.
24-inch dbh: large hardwoods such as beech, oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, etc.
b.
30-inch dbh: large softwoods such as cedars, pines, spruces, etc.
(2)
Trees not fully conforming to these sizes may be considered specimen trees in the case of a rare or unusual species, trees of exceptional aesthetic or unique quality, or trees of historical significance. Such trees may also be considered specimen trees when specifically used by a builder, developer or design professional as a focal point in a landscape design.
(3)
Specimen trees are also characterized as any tree in fair or better condition, as determined by the town manager or state forestry commission representative, meeting the following standards:
a.
A life expectancy of over 15 years.
b.
A structurally sound trunk, not hollow and having no extensive decay that exceeds 20 percent radial trunk dieback.
c.
No more than one major or several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only).
d.
No major insect or pathological problem.
(b)
Specimen tree stands. A contiguous grouping of trees that have been determined to be of high value by the town manager based on the following criteria:
(1)
A relatively mature even-aged stand.
(2)
A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature.
(3)
A stand of historical or cultural significance.
(4)
A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality.
(c)
Density credit. In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and incorporation of these trees into the project design, additional density credit will be given for successful preservation of specimen trees. Credit assigned for any specimen tree saved will be two times the density unit value shown in section 105-265(d), table 1. Specimen trees shall be verified by the town manager, and shall be located on the tree protection plan.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-012), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-253. - Minimum site density standards.
(a)
For all areas being developed, except land used for pasture land, a minimum site density of 100 units per acre, exclusive of any acreage within a zoning buffer area and any trees needed to meet buffer requirements as set forth in the zoning ordinance or as conditions of zoning approval, must be maintained on all properties subject to this article. For all areas used as pasture land for the past ten years, a minimum site density of 50 units per acre exclusive of any acreage within a zoning buffer area and any trees needed to meet buffer requirements as set forth in the zoning ordinance or as conditions of zoning approval must be maintained on all properties subject to this article. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area and is not synonymous with "tree." The density standard must be met as a condition of development permits distance whether or not a property contained trees prior to development. Trees, both existing and planted, shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site where feasible, with an emphasis on tree groupings to achieve aesthetic results in conformance with professional landscaping standards. Trees may be planted for credit within a public right-of-way, subject to approval by the town manager.
(b)
This density may be achieved through credits for preserving existing trees, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards of this article, or through a combination of both. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all reasonable efforts must be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to, alteration of building design; alternate location of buildings, parking areas and stormwater detention facilities; or relocation of utilities.
(c)
Minimum site density shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in section 105-265(b). Property owners shall be subject to the minimum site density standard set forth in this section. The density calculation shall be based on the net site area, excluding infrastructure improvements, such as roads, utility easements, detention ponds, etc. In no event, shall off-street parking areas be considered as infrastructure improvement.
(d)
Site density credits. Credit shall be given for existing trees to be retained which are a minimum diameter of three inches; credit shall be given for trees planted which are a minimum caliper of 2½ caliper inches. Additional credits shall be granted under the following circumstances: A total site density credit, not to exceed twice the normal credit, may be granted by the town manager for existing trees to be retained which have greater value as outstanding specimen trees, trees having historic value or being a rare or unique species.
(e)
Trees replanted to achieve density standards are to be species selected from the tree species selection list in section 105-266 or as otherwise approved by the town manager. Replanting shall be at a minimum ratio of one canopy tree for every three understory trees. Minimum density may be met by planting all canopy trees; however, such density shall not be met by planting only understory trees.
(f)
In addition, no more than 40 percent of any one genus may comprise the trees proposed in any replanting plan.
(g)
Minimum size requirements for replacement trees are contained in section 105-265(e), table 2.
(h)
Tree planting requirements may be amended by the town manager in cases where minimum site densities are not evenly distributed on the net site area and aesthetic appearances are an issue.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-013), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-254. - Tree survey inspection.
Following receipt of a complete tree removal application, development plan, or tree survey and supporting data, the Town engineer shall conduct an inspection of the proposed development site within ten working days. The applicant shall be notified by telephone 48 hours in advance of the date and time of inspection. Following the inspection, the town engineer shall advise the applicant of any recommended changes in the applicant's proposed tree removal, protection or replanting plans, consistent with the purposes of this article.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-014), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-255. - Tree protection requirements.
The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be retained for credit toward the minimum density standard:
(1)
Tree protection areas. Tree root systems are the most critical factor in tree preservation throughout the development process. The root system can easily extend beyond the drip line of the tree canopy. Disturbance of the root system can directly affect a tree's survival. The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be retained for credit toward the minimum site density standard and to protect the critical root zones:
a.
The root system within the drip line is generally considered to be the critical root zone. To protect these critical root zones, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained.
b.
The tree protection area shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy as defined by the drip line of the tree or group of trees, collectively. In some instances, an area greater than the drip line area may be required to be designated as a tree protection area as determined by the town manager.
c.
Layout of the project site utility and grading plans shall avoid disturbance of tree protection areas. Whenever utilities must be installed within a tree protection area and such installation will encroach into the drip line of any tree to be saved, the utility shall be installed by tunneling at a minimum depth of 36 inches. Reasonable efforts shall be made to save as many trees as possible, including avoiding utility routing which would endanger the taproot of certain species.
d.
Construction site activities such as vehicle or equipment parking, materials storage, concrete washout, burn pit placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent damage to trees within tree protection areas.
(2)
Protective barriers.
a.
Prior to any land disturbance, all protective tree barriers shall be installed and maintained until completion of site landscaping. Authorization to remove protective barriers shall be in writing by the town manager or by issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. Inspection of tree protection barriers is required prior to any land disturbance or development activity; the town engineer shall be contacted to schedule an inspection. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are recommended for site entrances.
b.
Tree fencing shall be a minimum of four feet high, constructed in a post-and-rail configuration. A two-inch by four-inch wooden post and a double one-inch by four-inch wooden rail, painted orange, is recommended. Four-foot orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing is also acceptable (Figure 1).
c.
Where approved, other forms of tree protection may be utilized to delineate tree save areas which are remote from areas of land disturbance. These areas must be completely surrounded with continuous rope of flagging (heavy mil, a minimum of four inches wide). All such tree protection must be accompanied by "Keep Out" or "Tree Save" signs (Figure 2).
d.
All tree protection areas must be protected from soil sedimentation intrusion through the use of silt fencing or other acceptable measures placed upslope from tree protection areas. No construction of any structure or improvement or any construction activity shall encroach or place solvents, materials, construction machinery or temporary soil deposits within six feet of the drip line, as defined herein, of any specimen tree or any tree within a tree protection zone.
e.
All tree protection measures must be maintained throughout land disturbance and construction and shall not be removed until final landscaping is installed.
(3)
Encroachment. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. If encroachment is anticipated within the critical root zones of exceptional trees, stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones, the following preventive measures shall be employed:
a.
Clearing activities. Roots often fuse and tangle among trees. Tree removal adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Where possible, it is advisable to cut minimum two-foot trenches (e.g., using a "Ditch Witch") along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, roots. Trenching may be required for the protection of exceptional specimen trees.
b.
Soil compacting. No parking, material storage or traffic shall be permitted within designated tree protective zones.
c.
Utility installation. The installation of utilities through a protective zone should occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching (Figures 3 and 4).
d.
Grade changes. A decrease in grade is best accomplished with the use of retaining walls or through terracing (Figure 5).
e.
Where the town manager has determined that irreparable damage has occurred to trees within tree protective zones, the trees shall be removed and replaced in a manner consistent with this article.
(4)
Trees to be retained.
a.
Canopy trees with a drip line area within 20 feet of a proposed structure should be removed and replaced with an appropriate tree species. When such canopy trees are to be saved, special attention shall be given to protection of the drip line area. The state forestry commission should be contacted for technical assistance.
b.
Where design constraints require placement of paved surfaces within ten feet of the drip line area of a canopy tree, such trees should be removed and replaced with an appropriate tree species. Alternately, the state forestry commission may be contacted to provide technical assistance concerning appropriate precautions that may be used to protect the tree and pavements (Figure 6).
c.
All reasonable efforts shall be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable effort shall include, but not be limited to, alteration of building design; alternate location of buildings, parking areas and stormwater detention facilities; or relocation of utilities.
d.
When a choice is available as to which existing trees to save, emphasis shall be given to the preservation of specimen trees, even isolated individual trees, over the retention of other trees. Non-specimen trees, however, should be saved in stands rather than as individual trees scattered over a site.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-015), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-256. - Alternate compliance to site density standard.
(a)
The intent of this article is to ensure that a minimum site density is maintained on all developed sites. In limited cases, this intent cannot be realized as a particular site will not bear the required density. Two methods of alternate compliance may be acceptable, at the discretion of the town manager.
(1)
Planting at a location other than the project site; or
(2)
Contributing to the town tree bank.
(b)
The following standards have been established for administering these alternative compliance methods:
(1)
The town manager must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall more than 50 percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance.
(2)
As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site proposed for development.
(3)
No development permit shall be issued unless the town manager has approved the request for alternate compliance and received the necessary documentation and funds.
(c)
Alternate location. Whenever trees are to be planted at an alternate location, a tree replacement plan, meeting all applicable standards, must be reviewed and approved. The following note must be shown on the approved plan:
A tree replacement plan addendum for this project shall be submitted to the town manager for the Town of Tyrone a minimum of 30 days prior to requesting a formal inspection. This plan shall include the species, size and location of trees to be planted off-site to conform to site density standards of this article. Release of this project is subject to approval of this plan, as well as verification of the installation of trees.
(d)
The following conditions apply when a tree is to be removed under the provisions of this article:
(1)
The town may, with the consent of the property owner, relocate the tree at the town's expense to town-owned property for replanting, either for permanent use at the new location, or for future use on other town property.
(2)
Credit may be given to the property owner, for each relocated tree as though the tree was proposed to remain on the property, provided the tree is relocated to a site designated by the town at the owner's expense.
(e)
Town tree bank. As an alternate method of compliance, the town will accept monetary donations to the town tree bank. These donations will be used for the sole purpose of planting trees on public property within the town limits. Methods of calculating contributions to the town tree bank are contained in section 105-267.
(f)
The town tree bank will be administered by the town manager. A quarterly report shall be submitted to mayor and council indicating monies collected, funds expended, and the species, number, size and location of trees planted.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-016), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-257. - Tree species selection list for replanting.
A tree species selection list providing recommended canopy and understory tree species for replanting is contained in section 105-266. The town manager shall review all tree replacement plans to ensure tree species selected are appropriate native species. The following species are considered inappropriate and shall not be used to comply with the requirements of this article:
(1)
Eastern White Pine.
(2)
Lombardy Poplar.
(3)
Mimosa.
(4)
Silver Maple.
(5)
Spruce.
(6)
Box Elder.
(7)
Black Willow.
(8)
Royal Paulownia.
(9)
Tree of Heaven.
(10)
Keyland Cypress.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-017), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-258. - Sequence of tree planting and removal.
All tree protection devices shall be installed prior to any clearing, grubbing or grading. The town engineer must inspect the installation of tree protection and erosion and sedimentation control devices prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit or other development or construction permit. Tree protection must remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-018), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-259. - Removal or destruction of trees; permits.
(a)
Tree removal. Tree removal shall be prohibited in the following circumstances:
(1)
Soil erosion or runoff problems will result due to topography, soil type, or proximity to floodplain areas, and the removal will substantially and adversely impact the existing soils relative to runoff and/or erosion. Information provided by the town engineer or other environmental specialist may be used by the town manager.
(2)
Specimen trees are located on site and cannot be adequately protected or replaced. Additionally, removal may be prohibited if reasonable accommodation can be made to alter the proposed project to save specimen trees and such accommodation have not been made.
(3)
The removal will have a significant, adverse impact on property values of any adjoining property.
(4)
Specimen trees removed with prior approval from the town manager must be replaced in addition to the minimum site density standard to compensate for their removal. Specimen trees must be replaced in an inch-by-inch basis by species with the potential for comparable size and quality. For example, removal of a 30-inch diameter tree would require replacement with 15 two-inch caliper trees of a comparable species. This tree replacement is in addition to the minimum site density.
(5)
Any specimen tree removed without the appropriate review and approval of the town manager must be replaced by trees with a total density equal to twice the unit value of the tree removed. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its condition.
(6)
Removal of specimen trees ten inches or greater in diameter shall be permitted only in conjunction with an approved tree protection plan, an approved tree replacement plan as appropriate, an approved grading plan, and an approved site development plan.
(b)
Permits required. No person shall directly or indirectly remove or destroy any tree having a diameter of six inches or greater which is located on property subject to the provisions of this article without first obtaining a permit as provided herein.
(c)
Application for permit. Permits shall be obtained through application in a form prescribed by the zoning administrator. Each application shall include:
(1)
A written, signed statement citing the necessity for the removal or destruction of any tree; and
(2)
The criteria set forth in subsection (e) of this section and that the applicant contends are met.
(d)
Application review. Upon receipt of a complete application, the zoning administrator shall review said application pursuant to the requirements of this article. The zoning administrator shall either approve, deny or approve subject to conditions consistent with this article. An applicant may submit a new application at any time following denial of an application made pursuant to this article. All applications not acted upon within 30 days of the date of receipt of a complete application by the zoning administrator shall be deemed approved. An applicant may appeal the denial of a permit to the planning commission as provided under the town zoning ordinance.
(e)
Criteria for tree removal or destruction. No permit shall be issued for removal or destruction of any tree unless:
(1)
A tree replacement plan meeting the requirements of subsection (f) of this section has been approved;
(2)
All other applicable requirements of this article are met; and
(3)
One of the following conditions exists:
a.
The tree is located within the buildable area of the lot and the applicant has concurrently filed an application for a building permit to make improvements otherwise permissible under all applicable ordinances of the town.
b.
The tree is diseased or injured to the extent that death is imminent within two years, is in imminent danger of falling, is so close to existing or proposed structures as to endanger them, physically interferes with utility services in a manner that cannot be corrected by anything less than destruction or removal of the tree, or creates a hazardous traffic condition.
(f)
Standards for tree replacement. Each applicant shall, to the maximum extent feasible, minimize the removal of trees from the site. In any request for a permit for tree removal in which the resulting site density present on the site will be less than 100 density units per acre, the zoning administrator shall require replacement such that the average number of trees on the site is equal to not less than 100 density units per acre. Where tree removal is unavoidable, trees replanted shall be an appropriate species mix considered native to the region.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-019), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-260. - Tree topping.
It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person to top any tree. Topping is defined as the severe pruning of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the crown of a tree to such an extent as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this provision at the discretion of the town manager.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-020), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-261. - Tree harvesting.
Selective tree harvesting may be permitted upon authorization by the town manager. Permits authorizing tree harvesting shall be in accordance with the following standards:
(1)
A 75-foot undisturbed buffer shall be provided and maintained along the entire perimeter of the property, including road frontages, except for authorized access crossings.
(2)
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, no property owner shall be required to preserve an undisturbed buffer that covers more than 25 percent of the total land area of the property, excluding areas inside the 100-year floodplain. In any such case, an alternate buffer width shall be provided, as determined by the planning commission pursuant to its review of the application for a tree harvesting permit.
(3)
The property shall be required to meet a site density standard of 100 (or 50) units per acre, not including the 75-foot buffer, upon completion of authorized tree harvesting activities.
(4)
The owner/developer shall utilize the recommended best management practices as established by the state forestry commission.
(5)
Once tree harvesting takes place in conformity with the regulations of this section, no development of the property within five years shall be permitted that would require either the property to be rezoned or removal of trees preserved under this section.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-023), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-262. - Tree removal and utility or construction companies.
(a)
All provisions of this article shall apply to any person removing trees on behalf of any other person, including all tree removal companies, utility companies or persons in the business of moving trees or construction. It shall be unlawful for any person or company to remove or cause to be removed any tree, or undertake any work for which a development permit is required pursuant to this article, unless a valid permit thereof is in effect and displayed according to section 105-264. If any such work or removal is performed without the permit being displayed as required, such removal or work shall constitute a violation of this article and shall subject the person or company violating this article to all penalties provided herein. Utility companies may perform emergency work without formal approval; provided, however, that such emergency work is reported in writing to the town manager within three business days following completion of all emergency work. Further, the permit taken by any person, company or utility under this section shall include defined areas of tree cutting and trimming under a single permit.
(b)
All tree removal companies, utility companies or persons in the business of removing trees or construction shall remove from the site of any trees, stumps, limbs or debris generated by activities allowed through issuance of a permit under this article.
(c)
All utility companies shall be required to obtain an annual permit issued by the zoning administrator. All applications for an annual permit shall include a list of subcontractors with names, addresses, telephone numbers and town occupational permit numbers. Quarterly work schedules are to be submitted to the town manager indicating the proposed locations and extent of tree work to be performed.
(d)
All tree trimming and pruning to be performed by public utilities, public agencies, and their subcontractors on trees growing on private or public rights-of-way shall be done according to the National Arborist Association Standards for Pruning of Shade Trees.
(e)
The routing of all public and private utility easements shall be subject to review and comment by the town engineer.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-026), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-263. - Debris disposal requirements.
Following any land-disturbing activity, including clearing, grading or logging, all biodegradable debris, including but not limited to tree stumps, trunks, limbs or brush, shall be hauled off site to an appropriate disposal location or chipped to be used as mulch.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-027), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-264. - Display of permit and inspections.
The applicant shall prominently display the permit issued at the job site. Such permit shall be displayed continuously while trees are being removed or replaced or work performed as authorized on the permit. As a condition for issuance of a permit, the applicant shall agree in writing to entry onto his premises by representatives of the town as designated by the town manager to inspect the permit and activities at any time, and such entry shall be lawful. Failure to allow such entry shall be unlawful and shall constitute a violation of this article.
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-028), 5-1-2002)
Sec. 105-265. - Density factor analysis.
(a)
All properties subject to this article must maintain a minimum site density of 100 units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area, and is not synonymous with "tree." The density requirement must be met as a condition of development permit issuance, whether or not a property contained trees prior to development. This density may be achieved through credits for preserving existing trees, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards of this article, or through a combination of both.
(b)
The following formula shall apply to Site Density Standard (SDS) analysis:
SDS=EDF+RDF
SDS is the minimum site density to be achieved and maintained on all developed sites, 100 units per acre.
Existing Density Factor (EDF) is the density value or credit of existing trees to be preserved on a site.
Replacement Density Factor (RDF) is the density value of new trees to be planted on site.
(c)
The following steps are used to calculate the required tree preservation or replacement density:
Step 1: Calculate the Site Density Standard (SDS). SDS is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by 100.
EXAMPLE: A 2.5-acre site has a SDS of 2.5 × 100 = 250
Step 2: Calculate the Existing Density Factor (EDF). EDF is determined by converting the diameter of individual, existing trees to site density units as indicated in Table 1 in subsection (d) of this section. These units are then totaled to determine the site EDF.
EXAMPLE: Seven trees will remain on the 2.5-acre site. This includes four six-inch trees and one eight-inch tree. The following site density units are associated with the trees to be preserved:
EXPAND
Number
of Trees Size Class Density Units Site Density
4 6-inch 12 48
2 7-inch 15 30
1 8-inch 20 20
7 TOTAL      98 TOTAL
  The total site density units, 98, is the Existing Density Factor (EDF).
Step 3: Calculate the Replacement Density Factor (RDF). RDF is determined by subtracting the EDF value from the SDS value.
EXAMPLE: 250 (SDS) - 98 (EDF) = 152 (RDF)
Step 4: Calculate a sample plan for achieving the required Replacement Density Factor (RDF).
Example: Plant eight 2½-inch, nine three-inch, seven four-inch, five five-inch and three six-inch diameter trees as presented below.

  (f)
Basis of site density tables. Site density is based on a reservation of 25 percent of the total area of each development site as open space. This is the Atlanta Regional Commission minimum standard for impervious ratios in groundwater recharge areas. It is accepted here as a reasonable standard for minimizing flooding potential and preserving the town's tree canopy. For a two-acre lot, this represents an area of 21,780 square feet. The town zoning ordinance requirement for landscaping is two trees for each 1,000 square feet of permanently disturbed area. The minimum planting size for canopy trees is 2½-inch caliper. This results in 43.56 trees for the 21,780 square foot area. Accordingly, a total of 40 trees in the 2½-inch size class, 100 density units, is the basis of the tree diameter conversion for replacement trees. As this article favors preservation of existing trees, the density credits are substantially skewed in favor of such preservation.

Sec. 105-267. - Appendix C, formula for determining contributions to tree bank.
(a)
Calculations for valuing contributions to the tree bank are based on 2½-inch caliper replacement trees with a value updated semi-annually, and on file with the town clerk, representing the average cost of materials, labor and guarantee for trees planted in the town area.
Example calculation: To determine the appropriate contribution to the tree bank, calculate the Density Factor Deficient (DFD) or number of density units which cannot be planted on the site.
Divide the DFD by 2.5 (the density unit value of a 2½-inch caliper replacement tree from Table 1), multiply the result by $200.00 (cost of 2½-inch caliper replacement tree).
A 2.5-acre site has a required Site Density Standard (SDS) of 250 units (2.5 × 100 = 250).
(b)
As specified in the approved tree protection plan and tree replacement plan, following development, four six-inch trees, two seven-inch trees and one eight-inch tree will be preserved, totaling 98 site density units (Existing Density Factor). However, due to site limitations, only 120 density units may be planted as replacement trees, the Planted Density Factor (PDF).
(c)
The Density Factor Deficient (DFD) is determined using the formula: DFD = SDS - (EDF + PDF)
In this example, DFD = 250 - (98 + 120) = 32 units
(d)
A total of 32 density units, as calculated using Table 2, must be planted at an alternate location or the developer may elect to contribute the dollar value of these units to the town tree bank.
(e)
The contribution amount is calculated by dividing the Density Factor Deficient (DFD) by the number of density units credited for a 2½ tree, multiplied by $200.00.
That is, 32 (DFD) ;div; 2.5 (density units) × 200 (cost per tree) = $2,560.00
(f)
The dollar amount represents the total developer contribution to the tree bank in lieu of replacement trees planted on site.
(g)
Site density credits bear a relationship to the cost of planting the respective tree sizes, favoring planting of larger trees, which bears a relationship to survival rate, through a certain size class, as reflected below. The most economical replanting size is four-inch caliper nursery stock.

(Ord. No. 485, § 1(6-10-8), 2-14-2006)
Sec. 105-300. - Findings and purposes.
(a)
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;
(2)
Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
(3)
The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
(4)
These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits;
(5)
Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution.
(b)
Therefore, the town has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff.
(Ord. No. 485, § 1(6-10-1), 2-14-2006)
Sec. 105-301. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(2)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(3)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(4)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(5)
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan;
(6)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained and pose no threat to public safety; and
(7)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.
(b)

(2)
Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more;
(3)
Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the town to be a hotspot land use; or
(4)
Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules.
(c)
Exemptions. The following activities are exempt from this article:
(1)
Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project;

(d)
Designation of ordinance administrator. The town engineer or his designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article.
(e)
Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.
(f)
Stormwater design manual. The town will utilize the policy, criteria and information including technical specifications and standards in the latest edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and any relevant local addenda for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article. The manual may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science, engineering, monitoring and local maintenance experience.

Prior to the issuance of any permit for a land development activity requiring a stormwater management facility or practice hereunder and for which the town requires ongoing maintenance, the applicant or owner of the site must, unless an on-site stormwater management facility or practice is dedicated to and accepted by the town, execute an inspection and maintenance agreement, and/or a conservation easement, if applicable, as follows:
(1)
The inspection and maintenance agreement, if applicable, must be approved by the town prior to plan approval and recorded in the deed records upon final plat approval.
(2)
The inspection and maintenance agreement shall identify by name or official title the persons responsible for carrying out the inspection and maintenance. Responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the stormwater management facility or practice, unless assumed by a governmental agency, shall remain with the property owner and shall pass to any successor owner. If portions of the land are sold or otherwise transferred, legally binding arrangements shall be made to pass the inspection and maintenance responsibility to the appropriate successors in title. These arrangements shall designate, for each portion of the site, the person to be permanently responsible for its inspection and maintenance.
(3)
As part of the inspection and maintenance agreement, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often routine inspection and maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility or practice. The agreement shall also include plans for annual inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled maintenance activities and shall also include remedies for the default thereof.
(4)
In addition to enforcing the terms of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the town may also enforce all of the provisions for ongoing inspection and maintenance in section 105-305.
(5)
The town, in lieu of an inspection and maintenance agreement, may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this article and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance.
(e)
Application procedure. Unless specifically exempted by this article, any owner or developer proposing a land development activity shall submit to the town a permit application on a form provided by the town engineer for that purpose. The application procedure shall be as follows:

Modifications for off-site facilities.
(1)
The stormwater management plan for each land development project shall provide for stormwater management measures located on the site of the project, unless provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site or regional facility. The off-site or regional facility must be located on property legally dedicated for the purpose, must be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater quantity and quality control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices, and there must be a legally-obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the off-site or regional stormwater facility. In addition, on-site measures shall be implemented, where necessary, to protect upstream and downstream properties and drainage channels from the site to the off-site facility. A stormwater management plan must be submitted to the town which shows the adequacy of the off-site or regional facility.
(2)
To be eligible for a modification, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the town that the use of an off-site or regional facility will not result in the following impacts to upstream or downstream areas:
a.
Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and property;
b.
Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures;
c.
Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation;
d.
Degradation of in-stream biological functions or habitat; or
e.
Water quality impairment in violation of state water quality standards, and/or violation of any state or federal regulations.
(Ord. No. 485, § 1(10-164), 2-14-2006)
Sec. 105-303. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria.
The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article:
(1)
Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
a.
It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual;
b.
Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and
c.
Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the town are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices.
(2)
Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer.
b.
24-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the town for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a manmade channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream stream bank or channel integrity.
c.
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.
(3)
Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (2) of this section is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the town for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions.
(4)
Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the town for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions.
(5)
Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the town before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the town may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control.
(6)
Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (1) of this section. The applicant may, if approved by the town, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.
(7)
Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catchbasins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements:
a.
Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual;
b.
All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and
c.
Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual.
(8)
Dam design guidelines. Any land-disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.
(Ord. No. 485, § 1(6-10-5), 2-14-2006)
Sec. 105-304. - Construction inspections of post-development stormwater management system.
(a)
Inspections to ensure plan compliance during construction.
(1)
Monthly inspections or more frequently as required by the town of the stormwater management system construction shall be conducted by the applicant and certified by a professional engineer who has been approved by the town. Periodic inspections of the stormwater management system construction shall be conducted by the town staff to insure compliance during construction. Construction inspections shall utilize the approved stormwater management plan for establishing compliance. All inspections shall be documented with written reports that contain the following information:
a.
The date and location of the inspection;
b.
Whether construction is in compliance with the approved stormwater management plan;
c.
Variations from the approved construction specifications; and
d.
Any other variations or violations of the conditions of the approved stormwater management plan.
(2)
If any violations are found, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions.
(b)
Final inspection and as-built plans. Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant is responsible for certifying that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan. All applicants are required to submit actual "as-built" plans for any stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices and must be certified by a professional engineer. A final inspection by the town is required before the release of any performance securities can occur.
(Ord. No. 485, § 1(6-10-6), 2-14-2006)
Sec. 105-305. - Ongoing inspection and maintenance of stormwater facilities and practices.
(a)
Long-term maintenance inspection of stormwater facilities and practices.
(1)
Stormwater management facilities and practices included in a stormwater management plan which are subject to an inspection and maintenance agreement must undergo ongoing inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of the agreement, the plan and this article.
(2)
A stormwater management facility or practice shall be inspected on a periodic basis by the responsible person in accordance with the approved inspection and maintenance agreement. In the event that the stormwater management facility has not been maintained and/or becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the town shall notify the person responsible for carrying out the maintenance plan by registered or certified mail to the person specified in the inspection and maintenance agreement. The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the agreement and the plan and shall specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. If the responsible person fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the town may correct the violation as provided in subsection (d) of this section.
(3)
Inspection programs by the town may be established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to:
a.
Reviewing maintenance and repair records;
b.
Sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in stormwater management facilities; and
c.
Evaluating the condition of stormwater management facilities and practices.
(b)
Right-of-entry for inspection. The terms of the inspection and maintenance agreement shall provide for the town to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this article is occurring or has occurred and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this article.
(c)
Records of maintenance activities. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall provide records of all maintenance and repairs to the town.
(d)
Failure to maintain. If a responsible person fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the town, after 30 days' written notice (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24 hours' notice shall be sufficient), may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance requirements by performing the necessary work to place the facility or practice in proper working condition. The town may assess the owner of the facility for the cost of repair work which shall be a lien on the property, and may be placed on the ad valorem tax bill for such property and collected in the ordinary manner for such taxes.
(Ord. No. 485, § 1(6-10-7), 2-14-2006)
