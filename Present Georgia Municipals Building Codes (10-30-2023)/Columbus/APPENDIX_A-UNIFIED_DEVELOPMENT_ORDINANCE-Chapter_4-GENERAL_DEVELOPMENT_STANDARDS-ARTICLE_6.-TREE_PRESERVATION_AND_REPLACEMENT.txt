Section 4.6.7. - Tree Density Unit Requirements.
The calculations for determining TDU requirements are provided in this Section. Compliance with the tree density unit standards is required, whether or not a site supported trees prior to development.
A.
Achieving Tree Density Units. The TDUs required by this Article may be achieved by the following:
1.
Counting existing trees to be preserved;
2.
Planting new trees; or
3.
Combination of preservation and new plantings.
B.
Formula for Calculation of Density. The formula for determining total tree density units is indicated below:
EXPAND

Total Tree Density Units (TTDU) =
Existing Tree Density Units (ETDU) + Replacement Tree Density Units (RTDU)
  1.
Total Tree Density Units Requirements for a Site. The Total Tree Density Unit (TTDU) requirement for a site is the minimum Tree Density Units (TDU) required to be maintained on a developed site.
(A)
Calculation. This number is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by the appropriate Tree Density Unit (TDU) number for the applicable zoning classification.
(B)
Site Acreage. This number is determined by starting with the total area of the parcel of land on which the project is located.
(C)
Exclusions. Excluded from the site acreage is the area of any utility easement and pond or lake and dam over one acre in area.
2.
Existing Tree Density Units. Existing Tree Density Units ETDU is the density of existing trees to be preserved on a site.
(A)
Calculation. The ETDU is calculated by converting the diameter of individual existing trees to density factor units as indicated in Tables 4.6.1 and 4.6.2.
(B)
Exclusions. Trees that exist in any utility easements cannot be counted toward compliance with tree density requirements.

Notes. 1 All diameter measurements shall be rounded to the closest inch. Diameter is calculated by measuring the tree's circumference, in inches, at 4.5 feet above the ground and dividing by 3.1416.
2 DBH=Diameter at breast height and is typically measured at 4.5 feet above ground level.
3 Specimen trees greater than 40 inches can be calculated using the following formula: (diameter at DBH) 2 × .7854 ° 144
  3.
Replacement Tree Density Units. Replacement Tree Density Units (RTDU) is the density of new trees to be planted on a site.
(A)
Calculation. The RTDU is calculated by subtracting the ETDU from the TTDU. The density factor credit for each caliper size of replacement or new trees is shown in Table 4.6.3.
(B)
Exclusion. Trees that are replanted within any utility easement or street right-of-way cannot be counted toward meeting tree density requirements.

Figure 4.6.1
(Ord. No. 09-40, § 1, 7-14-09)
Section 4.6.16. - Alternative Compliance.
A.
Intent. The intent of this Article is to ensure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites. Occasionally, compliance with this intent cannot be attained because a project site will not support the required density of trees. When the City Arborist makes a writing finding that the project site will not bear the required density of trees, two methods of compliance are acceptable:
1.
Off-site planting at a location on public property or an appropriate conservation easement remote from the project site; or
2.
Contributing to the Columbus, Georgia Tree Replacement Fund.
B.
Standards for Alternative Compliance. The following standards have been established for administering these alternative compliance methods.
1.
Review and Approval. The City Arborist must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance within 15 day of receipt of such requests.
2.
Standards for Compliance. In no instance shall 100 percent of the required TDU be attained through alternative compliance. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question.
3.
Permit Issuance. The land disturbance permit will only be issued after the City Arborist has approved the request and received the necessary documentation or funds.
C.
Off-site Planting. If trees are to be planted at another location, the compliance with the standards listed below is required.
1.
Location. The off-site location should be in the same area of the City as the project site and will be selected by joint consultation between the developer and the City Arborist. If they are unable to agree upon a mutually acceptable site, then the Tree Board will select the site.
2.
Tree Planting Plan. A tree planting plan consistent with all applicable standards of this Article must be reviewed and approved by the City Arborist.
3.
Required Plan Note. The following note must be shown on the approved plan:
"A Tree Planting Plan addendum for this project shall be submitted to the City Arborist within 30 days from the date of this land disturbance permit. This plan shall include the species, size and location of trees to be planted off-site to meet the tree density deficit shown. Release of this project is subject to approval of this plan as well as verification of the installation of the trees."
D.
Tree Replacement Fund. As another method of alternative compliance, the City will accept donations to the City's Tree Replacement Fund. The donations shall be used for the sole purpose of planting trees on public property in the same area of the City as the project site.
1.
Calculating Contribution Amounts. Contribution calculations are based on two-inch caliper replacement trees with a value of $220.00, representing the average size and cost of materials, labor and guarantee for trees planted in the City.
2.
Minimum Contribution Formula. The formula for determining the total contribution is indicated below:
Required Contribution = Density Factor Deficit (DFD)/.5 (Unit Value) × $220.00 (Replacement Value).
Density Factor Deficit. The unit value that cannot be planted on the site.
Unit Value. The unit value of a two inch caliper replacement tree.
Replacement Value. $220.00 for trees planted in the City.
Example Calculation.
An example calculation to determine a required contribution is presented below.
A 2.2 acre site has a required total tree density units (TTDU) standard of 22.0, an existing tree density Units (ETDU) OF 11.4, and can only accommodate replacement tree density units (RTDU) of 9.0.
Determine the density unit deficit (DUD) using the formula: DUD=TTDU-ETDU-RTDU
In this example, DFD = 22.0 - 11.4 - 9.0 = 1.6
Determine the acceptable contribution amount as follows: 1.6 divided by .5 multiplied by $220.00 = $704.00
E.
Fund Administration. The Urban Forestry and Beautification Division will administer the Columbus Tree Replacement Fund. A quarterly report shall be submitted to the City Manager showing amounts collected, amount spent, and the types and locations of trees planted. The report will be made available to the Mayor and Council upon their request.
Section 4.6.17. - Inspections.
A.
Certification and Inspections.
1.
Inspections. Inspections shall be performed at any time during the development process, and from time to time, as determined by the City Arborist. The inspections shall be performed by the Arborist or designee, which may include officials of the Building Inspections and Code Division for single-family residential lots.
2.
Final Approvals. Prior to the release of the certificate of occupancy, final plat approval or final building inspection, an inspection will be performed to assure compliance with the tree protection and planting plan. The inspection and report shall be made by either the City Arborist or designee or by an individual with the qualifications as provided in Section 4.6.4.
(A)
Irrigation. Any required irrigation must be operational at this time. Hose bibs and other watering devices specified on the plans will be verified.
(B)
Plantings. All plantings and trees retained for TDU credit will be inspected.
(C)
Exception. Any certificate of occupancy or final building inspection may be granted prior to any required plantings having been fully installed if a "Request for Delay Affidavit" has been filed and approved by the Arborist.
B.
Maintenance Inspection. Any planted materials that are dead or missing at the time of a maintenance inspection must be replaced by the responsible party.
1.
City Arborist. The City Arborist shall provide the responsible party with a written evaluation of what trees need to be replaced and the time frame within which replacement is to occur.
2.
Additional Monitoring. Any trees in a state of decline will be noted and subject to monitoring at later dates. If such trees die, they will become the responsibility of the current owner to replace.
Section 4.6.18. - Variances and Appeals.
A request for variance shall be filed subject to the requirements of this Section and of Article 11 of Chapter 10.
A.
Administrative Variances.
1.
Authority of City Arborist. The City Arborist shall have the authority to grant variances not to exceed 20 percent of the minimum or maximum standards of this Article.
2.
Appeals from City Arborist Decision. Appeals of a decision made by the City Arborist shall be submitted to the Tree Board.
B.
Other Variances. Variances in excess of the amount that can be granted by the City Arborist shall be submitted to the Tree Board. Variances to this Article shall be granted under the same procedures as provided in Article 11 of Chapter 10, excluding the notification of property owners, except that the Tree Board will be acting as the appellate body on all matters under this Article rather than the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Tree Board is granted the same powers for hearing appeals and granting variances involving this Article as the Board of Zoning Appeals is granted in Chapter 10.
C.
Standards for Review. In addition to the standards for review contained in Article 11 of Chapter 10, the following standards shall be utilized for a variance from the requirements of this Article.
1.
Public Health, Safety and Welfare. The granting of the variance will not cause substantial detriment to the public health, safety or welfare; be injurious to other property; or impair the purpose and intent of this Article.
2.
Extraordinary Conditions. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question that would result in a particular hardship to the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations were carried out.
3.
Reasonable Use of Land. The strict application of this Article would deprive an applicant of reasonable use of the land, or would create an unnecessary hardship as distinguished from a mere inconvenience.
4.
Special Circumstances. Any special circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant taken subsequently to the adoption or amendment of this Article.
5.
Action or Variance Request. As applicable, the City Arborist or Tree Board may approve, modify or deny the requested adjustment or variance. The approval or modification shall be granted only if the Arborist or Board determines that approval of any adjustments would not be contrary to the intent of this Article and that literal enforcement of the above standards would be impractical and would result in unreasonable and unnecessary hardships.
6.
Timely Decisions. The City Arborist or Tree Board shall act as expeditiously as possible on all requests for variance and appeals.
(A)
City Arborist. The City Arborist shall act on all requests for variance with 15 days of receipt of the request.
(B)
Tree Board.
(1)
The Tree Board shall approve or reject any request for a variance or appeal from the decision of the City Arborist within 40 days after an application is filed.
(2)
If a meeting of the Tree Board has not been scheduled within the next 30 days of the filing of a request for variance or appeal, the Chair shall call a meeting.
(3)
The decision of the Board shall be issued within ten days following consideration of the request or appeal.
(4)
Notification of all actions on requests for variance or appeal, whether by the Arborist or Tree Board, shall be forwarded to the applicant by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and posted in a conspicuous place, or in the office of the City Arborist. The notification shall be in the form of a short, concise statement of the action taken.
(5)
Within 14 days after posting of a decision, but not thereafter, any decision of the City Arborist or Tree Board may be appealed by the applicant. The appeal of any decision by the City Arborist shall be submitted to the Tree Board and the appeal of any decision of the Tree Board shall be filed with the Clerk of Council for action by the Council of Columbus.
(6)
The appeal to the Council of Columbus is a de novo appeal and the Council may affirm, modify or reverse the ruling of the Tree Board.
