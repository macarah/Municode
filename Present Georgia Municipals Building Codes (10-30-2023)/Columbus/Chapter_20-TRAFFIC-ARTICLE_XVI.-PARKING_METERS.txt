  The following ordinances established a moratorium for specified periods of time on certain of the parking meter zones formerly enumerated in § 20-16.1:
Section 3 of Ord. No. 76-8 provided that the time limits for parking in the areas on Second Avenue, Third Avenue and Twelfth Street would be for 30 minutes. Section 4 of said ordinance provided that the method of parking, whether by ranking or parking, would remain as the method authorized after the adoption of said Ord. No. 76-8.

Sec. 20-16.2. - Spaces; marking; sizes; vehicle position.
On parts of streets designated in the preceding section hereof there shall be marked limit lines within which vehicles are to be either parked or ranked, in accordance with the provisions of said preceding section.
Where "parking" is herein provided for, such limit lines shall be marked at angles of approximately 30 degrees and marked with white lines so as to provide spaces approximately 7½ feet in width. Vehicles using such parking spaces when parked at sidewalk curbs shall be parked within such diagonal limit lines with their right front wheel against the adjacent curb, and when parked at a center parkway shall have the left front wheel against the parkway curb.
Where "ranking" is herein provided for, such limit lines shall be marked parallel with and approximately eight feet from the adjacent curb, and each space for ranking shall be divided from its contiguous space by a white line, so as to give to each ranking space a length of approximately 20 feet. Vehicles using such ranking spaces shall be ranked within such rectangular spaces with their right wheels next to the adjacent curb.
(Ord. No. 71-198, § 17, 7-20-71)
Sec. 20-16.3. - Installation; type.
Where parking meters are already in place, they shall be maintained as now located. When required by ordinance, the city manager shall have installed parking meters of the make and general type approved by the traffic division of the city.

Sec. 20-16.4. - Hours of operation; depositing coin.
From the hour of nine o'clock a.m., to the hour of six o'clock p.m. (except on Saturdays and Sundays and except as otherwise provided), in order that the police officers of the city may properly compute the time during which a vehicle is parked, it shall be unlawful for the operator to drive a vehicle into or occupy one of the parking meter spaces provided for herein without depositing in the meter at that place lawful coins of the United States in such amounts as are provided for in section 20-16.1 hereof for the period of time in which such vehicle is so parked. When depositing coins in the meter, the handle shall be turned to the right and then returned to the left, in accordance with directions to that effect appearing on the meter.

Sec. 20-16.5. - Continuous parking; limit; definition.
In order to hasten the departure of vehicle so as to help eliminate the abuse of the privilege of parking on the parts of the public streets herein designated, it shall be unlawful to permit a vehicle to remain in a parking space for a longer period continuously than the time limit applicable to such parking spaces as set forth in section 20-14.8 hereof. The word "continuously" as used herein shall be construed not only to mean leaving a vehicle stationed in a parking space, but it is the intention hereof that an operator of a vehicle shall be guilty of "continuously" occupying a parking space when he drives such vehicle from such space and then immediately reoccupies the same space.
The operator of any vehicle occupying a parking space longer than the time allowed in such space as set forth in section 20-16.1. of this Code, shall be guilty of a separate violation for each successive period of time as set forth for said space, that such vehicle occupies said space continuously.
(Ord. No. 71-198, § 17, 7-20-71)
Sec. 20-16.6. - Loading or unloading; time of free parking.
Between the hours from nine o'clock a.m. to six o'clock p.m., the operator of a vehicle while engaged in loading or unloading freight, express, parcel post mail, merchandise or other materials may occupy with such vehicle any parking space continuously for the period of 30 minutes, without the necessity of depositing any coin in such meter.
(Ord. No. 71-198, § 17, 7-20-71)
Sec. 20-16.7. - Slugs.
It shall be unlawful to deposit or cause to be deposited in any parking meter a slug device or metallic substitute for a coin of the United States.
(Ord. No. 71-198, § 17, 7-20-71)
Sec. 20-16.8. - Tampering.
It shall be unlawful to deface or tamper with, damage, open or wilfully break, destroy or impair any parking meter installed under the terms of this article.
(Ord. No. 71-198, § 17, 7-20-71)
Sec. 20-16.9. - Violations; indicator; presumptions.
When a parking meter displays the word "Violation", it shall be prima facie evidence, and presumed that the operator of the vehicle parked at such meter has violated the provisions of this article relating to the deposit of coins and the time limits for parking. When a vehicle is parked or ranked contrary to the provisions of this article, and the operator is unknown to the police officer discovering such violation, it shall be prima facie evidence, and presumed, that such operator is the same person as the owner of the automobile in whose name the vehicle is registered in the State of such owner's residence.
(Ord. No. 71-198, § 17, 7-20-71)
Sec. 20-16.10. - Notice; appearance.
When a vehicle is parked or ranked in violation of this article or in case of the violation of any other provisions hereof, and the operator of such vehicle is not present at the time such violation is discovered by a police officer of the city, such police officer shall attach to such vehicle a notice directing such operator to appear at the recorder's court at a named time; and failure of such operator to appear at such time shall constitute a violation of this article.
The notice attached to the vehicle shall have the date and hour of day when such notice was attached.
(Ord. No. 71-198, § 17, 7-20-71)
Sec. 20-16.11. - Fines; imprisonment.

If an offender proceeds to recorders court and if convicted by the recorder, offenders shall be subject to fines or imprisonment or both in the discretion of the recorder. Said fines shall apply to all parking violations contained in this chapter.
