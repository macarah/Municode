A.
Placement. To achieve a more natural appearance, plantings should not be evenly spaced or planted in a straight line, but should be staggered or grouped together. Plantings shall be distributed throughout the length of the buffer.
B.
Installation. Plantings shall be installed consistent with current nursery industry standards. See Section 4.6.15.
C.
Support. Plant materials shall be properly supported with wires, guy wires, stakes, and similar devices to ensure survival. Support devices shall not interfere with vehicular or pedestrian movement and shall be removed 12 months after installation.
D.
Topsoil. Topsoil, or appropriate substitute, shall be provided to a depth sufficient to ensure plant survival, in accordance with current nursery standards.
