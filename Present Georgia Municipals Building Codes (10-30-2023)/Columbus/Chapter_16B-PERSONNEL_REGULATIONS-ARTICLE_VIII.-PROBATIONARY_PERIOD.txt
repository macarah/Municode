ARTICLE VIII. - PROBATIONARY PERIOD

The probationary period shall be regarded as an integral part of the examination process and shall be utilized for closely observing the employee's work, for securing the most effective adjustment of a new employee to his position, and for rejecting any employee whose performance is not satisfactory.
(Ord. No. 71-213, Ch. 8, § 1, 8-17-71)
Sec. 16B-8-2. - Duration.
The probation period for general government employees shall be six months in duration which may be extended at the discretion of the appropriate department head for up to six additional months; provided however, that the probationary period for all sworn officers of the department of public safety shall be for 18 months in duration with no further extensions.

The personnel officer may, upon the request of the appointing authority made not later than 20 days before the expiration of the probationary period, extend the duration of such period and notify the employee.
