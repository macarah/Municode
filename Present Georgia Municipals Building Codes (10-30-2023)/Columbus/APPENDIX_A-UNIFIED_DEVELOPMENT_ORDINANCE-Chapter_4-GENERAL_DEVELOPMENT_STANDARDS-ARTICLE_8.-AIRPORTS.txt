ARTICLE 8. - AIRPORTS

Section 4.8.1. - Airports.
A.
Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to regulate and restrict growth, development and building height in the area adjacent to the Columbus Metropolitan Airport, including the following:
1.
Regulate and restrict the height of structures and objects of natural growth and otherwise regulate the use of property in the vicinity of the Columbus Metropolitan Airport;
2.
Regulate and restrict the use of property in the vicinity of the Columbus Metropolitan Airport to prevent development of high density residential dwellings or the concentration of large numbers of persons in those areas subject to low flying aircraft in the process of normal operations; and
3.
Protect flying aircraft by limiting the height of structures and trees.
Section 4.8.2. - Definitions.
Definitions relating to the Columbus Metropolitan Airport are provided in Chapter 13.
Section 4.8.3. - Runway Protection Zone/Airspace Drawing.
The Runway Protection Zone/Airspace Drawing, Columbus Metropolitan Airport, prepared by the LPA Group Incorporated, Aviation Consultants, dated March 1994, is adopted by reference as part of these land development regulations.
Section 4.8.4. - Airport Zones.
A.
Established. In order to carry out the provisions of this Chapter, airport zones are established which include all the land within the approach zones, transitional zones, horizontal zones, and conical zones as they apply to the City of Columbus. Individual airport zones are indicated below.
1.
Approach Zones. The inner edge of these zones coincides with the width of the primary surfaces, and the horizontal dimensions are the same as those shown on the airspace zoning map for the respective approach surfaces.
2.
Transitional Zones. These zones are hereby established as the area beneath the transitional surfaces.
(A)
Relation to Horizontal and Conical Surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and upward at 90-degree angles to the runway centerline and extend at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces.
(B)
Relation to Conical Surfaces and Centerline. Transitional zones for those portions of the precision approach zones which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach zones and at 90-degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
3.
Horizontal Zones. The horizontal zones are hereby established by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radius from the center of each end of the primary surface of Runway 5-23 and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include approach and transitional zones. This zone is the imaginary surface 150 feet above the highest point of the airport elevation.
4.
Conical Zones. The conical zones are hereby established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The conical zones do not include the precision instrument approach zones or the transitional zones.
B.
Location of Zones. The airport zones are shown on the Runway Protection Zone/Airspace Drawing, Columbus Metropolitan Airport, consisting of one sheet, prepared by the LPA Group Incorporated, Aviation Consultants, dated March 1994.
C.
Effect of Airport Zones.
1.
Additional Zoning Requirements. These airport zones shall be superimposed over existing zone districts and the special requirements of these airport zoning regulations shall apply in addition to the requirements of the use district within which a specific property is located.
2.
Multiple Zones. An area located in more than one of the following airport zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation.
Section 4.8.5. - Airport Zone Height Limitation.
A.
Height Limits. Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or be maintained in any zone created by these regulations to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for each zone.
B.
Elevation. Such height limitations are hereby established for each zone in question as the elevation of the respective imaginary surfaces shown on the airspace zoning map.
C.
Most Restrictive. Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail.
Section 4.8.6. - Use Restrictions.
A.
Interference Prohibited. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these land development regulations, one or more uses shall not be made of land or water within any zone established by these regulations in such a manner as to:
1.
Create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft;
2.
Make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others;
3.
Result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport;
4.
Impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport; or
5.
Otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
B.
Prohibited Uses. The following uses are prohibited in the first 2,500â€”foot segment of the approach zone beginning at the end of the primary surface for Runway 6-24 and the first 1,700-foot segment of the approach zone beginning at the end of the primary surface for Runway 13-31:
1.
Houses of worship, schools, lodges, clubs, theatres, and other places of public assembly;
2.
Multifamily dwellings in excess of four units per structure or in a group development;
3.
Hospitals and institutions; and
4.
Any other similar use where a concentration of people is customary.
C.
Airports. The following uses are permitted subject to conformity with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) safety standards applicable to the particular airport property:
1.
Grassed or paved runways, taxiways, landing strips and aprons;
2.
Aircraft fueling facilities;
3.
Aircraft storage, service and repair hangars;
4.
Passenger and freight terminal facilities, including any accessory use as contracted and approved by the Airport Commission;
5.
Lighting, radio and radar facilities;
6.
Accessory structures and facilities including aircraft, aviation and accessory sales.
Section 4.8.7. - Height Standards.
All buildings shall comply with Federal Aviation Agency height standards. Heights in excess of 30 feet may be permitted only upon securing a use permit from the Airport Commission.
Section 4.8.8. - Nonconforming Uses.
A.
Regulations not Retroactive. These airport regulations shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alterations of any structure or tree not conforming to these regulations as of the effective date of this chapter or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use.
B.
Marking and Lighting.
1.
Installation Required. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Columbus Metropolitan Airport Commission to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such hazards.
2.
Expense of Marking and Lighting. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the Columbus Metropolitan Airport.
C.
Termination of Nonconforming Uses.
1.
Discontinuance. The discontinuance of a nonconforming use for a period of one year shall result in loss of the nonconforming use status. In addition, the change of use to a more restrictive or to a conforming use for any period of time shall be considered evidence of intent of abandonment, and such nonconforming use shall not thereafter be revived.
2.
Partial Destruction. Any nonconforming use, building or structure that, as a result of fire, explosion, or other casualty, has 50 percent or more of its replacement value destroyed, shall thereafter be terminated, and any new construction shall be in accordance with these regulations.
3.
Expansion. Any existing nonconforming use as described in these regulations shall not be expanded by altering, replanting or otherwise enlarging it so as to increase in any way its hazard within the airspace required for flight of aircraft in landing or takeoff or to increase the potential hazard to persons assembled within a structure so located and used.
Section 4.8.9. - Variances.
Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure or permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with the regulations of this Article may apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a variance from such regulations.
Section 4.8.10. - Permits.
A.
Material Changes. A material change shall not be made in the use of land, and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted, or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted.
B.
Application. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired with sufficient information to determine whether the resulting use or structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted.
C.
Existing Use. A permit shall not be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of these regulations or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
D.
Hazard Marking and Lighting.
1.
Any permit granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of these regulations and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the Columbus Metropolitan Airport Commission, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard.
2.
Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the Columbus Metropolitan Airport.
E.
Approval Agencies. Applicants for a building permit or for variances to these regulations shall submit written approval from the City Engineer and the FAA, and other approval as required by the Chief of the Inspections and Code Enforcement Division regarding height and safety before issuance of a permit.
