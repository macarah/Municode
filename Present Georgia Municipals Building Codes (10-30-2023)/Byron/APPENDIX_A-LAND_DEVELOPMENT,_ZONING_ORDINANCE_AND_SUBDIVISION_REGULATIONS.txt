General
It shall be the duty and responsibility of the zoning enforcement officer to enforce all of the provisions contained in these regulations.
Within the jurisdiction of these regulations, no subdivision shall be constructed, platted, or recorded, nor shall any building permit be issued, unless all the requirements of these regulations have been approved in accordance with the requirements as specified in the articles for subdivision regulation.

The court of authority (magistrate court/superior court) shall, upon reasonable proof of violation of these regulations, have the duty to issue such temporary and/or permanent injunctions as the court decides as being necessary to prevent the violation of these regulations. The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part(s) thereof, as well as any architect, builder, contractor, developer, agent, or other person(s) who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation(s) may each be found guilty of a separate offense, and incur the penalties specified in this ordinance, and imposed by lawful decision of the court having jurisdiction.
Required Improvements
No subdivision shall be occupied unless all of the improvements (as required by these regulations) have been completed and approved by the zoning enforcement officer.
Erection of Buildings
No building or structure shall be located upon or erected upon any land subject to these regulations, nor shall any building permit be issued unless one of the following conditions exists:

The lot or parcel is within a subdivision for which a final plan has been approved by the planning and zoning commission, and the required improvements have been installed and accepted by the zoning enforcement officer.
b.
The lot or parcel abuts a public street or a public street through use, which has been dedicated to and opened and accepted by city council or such street is shown on a legally adopted subdivision plat.
c.
A variance has been granted by the mayor and city council.
The above subsection shall not apply to buildings and structures designed and constructed for agricultural uses.
Violations
Any persons, firm or corporation who shall violate these regulations or any part thereof, which is not allowed or permitted in any district without a variance or special exception which has been duly advertised and permitted by the commission and by city council shall be guilty of a violation of this ordinance and shall be fined not less than $25.00 nor more than $200.00 and/or imprisoned in the city jail for a period not exceeding 90 days. Upon determination of a violation, the zoning enforcement officer shall issue a "notice of violation" stating the nature of the violation and giving ten days to correct the violation or notify the zoning office of intent to appeal to the zoning board of appeals or giving adequate steps for correction and a time limit for the proposed corrections. If the violation continues more than ten days without notice of appeal or correction proposed, the zoning officer shall issue a citation to recorder's[municipal] court.

(a)
The division of land into parcels of five acres or more where no new street is involved.
(b)
The sale or exchange of parcels of land between separate or common owners of adjoining properties, provided that additional lots are not thereby created, and that the lots created are in accordance with the provisions of these regulations.

Variance. A variance is a relaxation of the terms of the zoning ordinance where such variance will not be contrary to the public interest, and where a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary and undue hardship. As used in this ordinance, a variance is authorized only for height, area, and size of structure, and size of yards and open spaces; establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited shall not be allowed by variance, nor shall a variance be granted because of the presence of nonconformities in the zoning district of use(s), in adjoining zoning district.
Yard. A yard is that portion of a lot extending open and unobstructed, except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, along the entire length of a lot line, and from the lot line for a depth or width set forth in the applicable district regulations.
Yard, front. A front yard is a yard extending along the full length of a front lot line.
Yard, side. A side yard is a yard extending along a side lot line from the required front yard to the rear yard.
Zero lot line. An approach to development of a lot whereby the exterior walls of a building are situated physically upon one or more of the lot boundary lines, without any "yards" as exemplified in the standard regulated configurations. Utilizing this type of site design increases the amount of open space remaining on the lot, and allows more flexibility in locating a building within a given lot's boundaries.
Zoning district. An area, or areas, within the limits of the city, for which regulations and requirements governing use, lot, and bulk of buildings and premises are uniform.

ARTICLE IV - PROCEDURE FOR APPLYING FOR A VARIANCE
1.
Applicant will submit to the zoning enforcement officer the completed "variance request application," and must pay the required administrative fee to the city clerk before the variance application will be considered.
The written application must prove that:
a.
Special conditions and/or circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structures, or required subdivision improvements involved, and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or required subdivision improvements; and
b.
A literal interpretation of the provisions of these regulations would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties with similar conditions; and
c.
The special conditions and/or circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; and
d.
The granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by these regulations to other lands, structures, or required subdivision improvements under similar conditions. No preexisting conditions on neighboring lands which are contrary to these regulations shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
2.
The zoning enforcement officer will review the variance application for completeness, and compliance with the rules and regulations of the zoning and subdivision regulations ordinances.
3.
The zoning enforcement officer and the chairman of the planning and zoning commission will schedule a public hearing to consider the proposed variance.
4.
At the direction of the chairman of the planning and zoning commission, the city clerk will, at least 15 days prior to the public hearing, (a) post, in city hall, a notice containing the time, place, and proposed variance action to be considered at the public hearing, and (b) post, in plain view of the public, a similar notice upon the affected property. The clerk shall send notices to every landowner of adjacent property with respect to the subject property, stating the request and the reason for the request and the time and place of the public hearing at least ten days in advance of the public hearing.
The cost of these two notification methods shall be included within the required administrative fee paid by the applicant, and shall be the same for any and all similar applications.
5.
The public hearing for the proposed variance will be held, and minutes of the meeting will be kept. Minutes of the public hearing will become part of the variance application.
6.
The zoning enforcement officer will submit his written review and recommendations, with the minutes of the public hearing, to the mayor and city council within 30 calendar days following the public hearing.
7.
The zoning review board will decide whether to grant the variance within 30 calendar days following its submission to the mayor and city council, and may grant a variance if the mayor and city council find that:
a.
The reasons set forth in the application, and the recommendations of the zoning enforcement officer, justify the granting of a variance that would enable the reasonable use of the land, buildings, or other improvements, and
b.
The variance granted is the minimum variance reasonably possible, and
c.
The granting of the variance would be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of these regulations, and will not be injurious to the surrounding territory or detrimental to the public health, welfare, and safety.
The mayor and city council, at the time of granting the variance, may prescribe reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with these regulations, which will become a part of the variance.
Under no circumstances shall the zoning review board grant a variance to allow a use in the district involved which is expressly, or by implication, prohibited by the terms of this ordinance.
8.
If granted, the applicant must exercise the variance within a period of one calendar year from the date of decision by the zoning review board. After one year's elapsed time, the variance is void, and of no further force and effect.

No lot owner shall grade his lot in such a manner as to interfere with the natural drainage of adjoining lots, or to divert the drainage of his lot onto adjoining lots, not [nor] to interfere with the natural drainage of any lot so that the drainage of such lot is diverted upon any public street or thoroughfare in such a manner, or in such amounts, as to flood a public street(s) or thoroughfare(s).
Every lot which is used for a building site shall be so graded that it will be dry and free from standing water, and the grade around the walls of every new building, at the point where the sill meets these walls, shall slope away from such walls into adequate means of drainage as may be approved by the city engineer at the request of the zoning enforcement officer.
Large Buildings
Commercial structures proposed to be constructed within the City of Byron which exceed 15,000 square feet in gross floor area, even though they meet all other requirements set forth in this ordinance, or any other ordinance, must receive separate approval of the city council after the proposed plans have been reviewed by, and recommendations received from, the planning and zoning commission, and the zoning enforcement official (either separately or in a joint communication). The planning and zoning commission, and the zoning enforcement official, shall review the proposed plans to insure that adequate provisions are made for traffic circulation, fire protection, sewage disposal, and, in general, the health and safety of the city's residents. The planning and zoning commission, and/or the zoning enforcement official, may recommend to the city council to impose certain restrictions or conditions prior to its approval and the granting of a building permit.
Parking of Commercial Vehicles
The regular or constant parking of commercial vehicles, which description shall include trucks and other vehicles, having a rated capacity of three-quarters ton or more, truck tractors having an overall length of more than 12 feet, or the storing, keeping, or maintenance of any machinery, equipment, building materials, or other material(s) is permitted only within specified districts.
Mobile Homes
No mobile home, as defined in this ordinance, shall be parked within a residential district, except where expressly permitted in the regulations for the residential type zoning districts.
Boats, Travel Trailers, and Recreational Vehicles
Boats, travel trailers, and recreational vehicles may be parked or stored entirely within a carport, garage, or other enclosed structure within a residential district. Where a partially or entirely enclosed storage structure does not exist on the residential lot, the vehicle may be parked on the rearmost portion of the lot away from streetside frontage. Boats, travel trailers, and recreational vehicles shall not be parked in a private driveway, or in the front or side yards of a residential lot for more than a period of 30 consecutive days. Under no circumstances shall any boat, travel trailer, or recreational vehicle be slept in or otherwise used for lodging or habitation purpose while parked or stored within a residential district.
Corner Lots, Through Lots, Lots of Unusual Shapes: Residential Setbacks
"Front of Lot"
For corner lots, the side having the least street frontage shall be considered the "front" for setback purposes.
Corner Lot (Other Than Reverse)
In the case of corner lots which do not have reversed frontage, the side yard toward the street shall be 15 feet or greater in depth. Accessory buildings and pools located in the rear yard of such a corner lot shall be set back 15 feet or more from the street right-of-way line.
Reverse Corner Lots
When the rear lot line of a corner lot is common with the sideline of an adjoining interior lot, the minimum rear setback for the corner lot shall be 20 feet, or a distance at least equal to the depth of the front yard setback of the abutting interior lot (measured from the street right-of-way line along the common property line). Accessory buildings and pools located in the required rear setback area of a reverse corner lot shall be set back from the street right-of-way a distance equal to the front yard depth of the adjoining interior lot. The minimum side yard setback shall be 15 feet on the remaining street side of a reverse corner lot.
Through Lots
In the case of "through lots," setbacks on all street frontages shall be at least the distance required for front yard setbacks in the particular residential district in which it is located. Where one of the front yards that would normally be required on a through lot is not in keeping with the prevailing yard pattern, the zoning enforcement official may waive the requirement for the normal front yard setback, and substitute a special yard requirement which shall not exceed the average of the yards provided on adjacent lots.
Lots of Unusual Shape
For corner lots of unusual shape, not forming part of a general rectangular lot pattern, the zoning enforcement official shall prescribe front and side yard setbacks on a case-by-case basis, subject to the following limitations:
1.
No front yard shall be required to have a greater depth than is required generally within the district.
2.
No side yard shall be required to have a greater width than the depth required generally for front yards within the same district; except the zoning enforcement officer may reduce side yards by one-half foot for each additional foot of front yard setback, but in no case shall the reduction be less than one-half of the required side yards for existing nonconforming lots of record.
Accessory Buildings in Residential Zones
No detached accessory use or structure shall be permitted in the required front yard, or the required side yards of the front half of the lot depth. On double-frontage lots (i.e., through lots), or corner lots, no detached accessory structures shall be permitted in the required yards fronting on streets.
When an accessory building is attached to a principal structure by a breezeway, roofed passage, or otherwise connected to the principal structure, the accessory structure shall comply with the dimensional requirements of the principal building.
Accessory structures for the housing of persons, such as guesthouses and garage apartments, shall not be located in any of the required yard areas of the principal residence. Other accessory structures shall not be built closer than five feet from any rear or side property line in the rear half of the lot depth.
No separate accessory building or structure shall be located within five feet of any other accessory building or structure.
The elevation of the highest point of any accessory building shall not exceed the elevation of the highest point of the main building.
The combined total ground area covered by the primary residential structure and all accessory buildings on a given lot shall not exceed 35 percent of the lot area in R-1 districts, 40 percent in R-2 districts, 55 percent of the lot area in R-3 districts. These percentages shall apply to townhouses.
No guesthouse or garage apartment shall be constructed upon a lot for occupancy before the completion of the main building(s). This shall not prohibit the erection of other accessory buildings prior to the construction of the principal building, when the accessory buildings are neither constructed nor used for dwelling purposes.
Walls and Fences
Requests for permits for the construction of walls, or erection of fences, must be accompanied by a site plan and drawings clearly showing the locations and heights for which approval is requested.
Height
In front yards, and in side yards with street frontage, walls and fences shall not exceed three feet in height above the street curb elevation or underlying ground level, whichever is lower. In the rear yard of a corner lot, fences in excess of three feet in height shall be set back from the street right-of-way the same distance as is prescribed for accessory buildings in the rear yard of corner lots, five feet. In all other side and rear yard areas, walls and fences may be a maximum of six feet in height above the ground level. Where compliance with these height limits would cause a hardship due to the natural topography of a particular lot, the zoning enforcement officer may permit portions of a fence or wall to be up to eight feet in height in areas where the normal maximum height would be six feet.
However, no wall or fence of any type (natural or manmade) shall be permitted which would in any way obstruct the visibility of automobiles at intersections and points of entry and exit to the public right-of-way.
Materials Permitted In Residential Districts
In any single-family residential district, fences in the front yard or in a side yard with street frontage shall be generally decorative in design and materials utilized. Chicken wire, barbed wire, electrically charged fences, or similar type fences shall not be erected in any residential district. Neither shall any wall, fence, or similar structure erected in any residential district contain any material(s) or substance(s) such as broken glass, spikes, nails, barbs, or any similar materials designed to inflict pain or injury upon any person or animal.
Designs and Materials Permitted in Nonresidential Districts
In any nonresidential district, barbed wire may be incorporated in or used as a fence above the level of six feet from ground level. Any utilization of barbed wire shall be placed so that it does not project outward over any street, sidewalk, public way, or adjacent property. Fences and walls within office (O-1), commercial (C-1 thru C-4), or industrial (I-1 and I-2) shall be designed and constructed so that adequate access to buildings is maintained for firefighting purposes.
Violations Affecting Public Safety
Should any person violate the part of this ordinance which prohibits hedges or plantings from obstructing visibility at intersections, and points of entry and exit to the public right-of-way (hedges and plantings in excess of 2½ feet in height), then the city may, after serving written notice upon the property owner responsible for such violation and a subsequent period of ten calendar days have elapsed, enter upon the property, where such violation is taking place, and cut and trim the hedges or plantings causing such violation to a height to conform with the provisions of this ordinance; and upon performing such labor, shall bill said property owner for the actual cost of such labor; it being determined by the city council that such hedges or plantings are in violation of this ordinance, and constitute a direct danger to vehicular traffic on streets of the city, and it being within the police power of the city to abate such danger or hazard to the public's safety.
Swimming Pool—Location, Walls and Fences
1.
All swimming pools, whether above or in ground, shall be completely enclosed by a fence or wall. Swimming pool fences and walls shall be subject to this subsection and shall not be subject to paragraph one of the subsection under walls and fences entitled "Height." The following requirements for swimming pool fences shall be as follows:
a.
Fences or walls around all swimming pools shall be not less than five feet nor more than six feet in height and have at least one access gate. All access gates shall open outwards away from the pool and shall be self-closing and have a self-latching device.
b.
Fences or rails constructed along the deck of an aboveground pool will not qualify as meeting the requirements of this subsection. A separate fence or wall meeting the requirements of this subsection will be required.
c.
Openings in fences shall not allow passage of a four-inch diameter sphere.
d.
A swimming pool enclosed within a screened structure shall not qualify as meeting the requirements of this subsection. A separate fence or wall meeting the requirements of this subsection will be required.
2.
Swimming pools shall be located a minimum of ten feet from all property lines.
Building(s) to Have Access
Every building hereafter erected or moved shall be on a lot adjacent to a public street, and all structures shall be so located on lots as to provide safe and convenient access for servicing, fire protection, other emergency vehicles, and required off-street parking.
Solid Waste Containers
Prior to the issuance of a building permit, plans for the construction of any and all commercial, office, or industrial buildings, and multiple-family residential complexes containing a total of more than ten residential units, must show the location of container(s) for solid waste disposal. The number of containers, their location, and access to them for unloading purposes, are subject to the approval of the director of public works.
Relocation or Moving a Building
Any building moved into or relocated to a new site within the city shall comply with all applicable City of Byron ordinances.

Whenever such a district is approved, it will be shown on the official map for the City of Byron.
(Ord. No. 2006-12, 9-11-2006)
Section 2 - Determining district boundaries.
The following rules shall apply when determining the exact boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the official map:
1.
Boundaries shown as following the centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys shall follow such centerlines;
2.
Boundaries shown as following platted lot lines shall follow such lines;
3.
Boundaries shown as following the city limits shall follow such limits;
4.
Boundaries shown as following railroad lines shall be midway between the main track lines;

Boundaries shown as following the banks of streams shall follow the centerlines of such streams, and in the event of a course change of such stream the centerline shall be construed as moving with the actual stream.
6.
Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map;
7.
Where physical features are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or not covered by subsections 1 through 6 above, the zoning review board shall interpret the district boundaries;
8.
When any street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applying to each lot and/or parcel of abutting property shall apply to that portion of such street or alley added to the property.
Section 3 - Application of district regulations.
The regulations established by this ordinance within each district apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land.
Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance:
1.
No building, structure, or land shall be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part(s) thereof shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or altered except in conformance with the regulations specified in this ordinance for the district in which it is located.
2.
No building or other structure shall be erected or altered:
a.
To exceed the height or bulk limitations;
b.
To accommodate or house a greater than permitted number of families;
c.
To occupy a greater than permitted percentage of lot area;
d.
To have a narrower or smaller than permitted front yard, side yards, or other open spaces; or
e.
Contrary to the provisions of this ordinance.
3.
For the purpose of complying with this ordinance, no open space shall fulfill the open space requirements of another building.
4.
Yards or lots created after the effective date of this ordinance shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this ordinance.
Section 4 - Special Structure Height Requirements.
No building or structure shall hereafter be erected, moved or altered which does not comply with the following height requirements:
1.
Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the construction of objects which, because of their height, illumination or reflectivity, electrical emissions, and/or air emissions, represent an obstruction or safety hazard to air traffic operating in and out of Robins Air Force Base.
2.
Definitions. The following definitions shall be used to interpret the requirements of this section:
a.
Conical surface. This inclined surface extends outward and upward from the outer periphery of the inner horizontal surface for a horizontal distance of 7,000 feet. The slope of the conical surface is 20:1 (one foot change in elevation for each 20 feet in distance from the starting point), with an inner elevation of 150 feet above the established airfield elevation and an outer elevation of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation.
b.
Established airfield elevation. The altitude, measured in feet above mean sea level (MSL), of the Robins Air Force Base main runway surface. This elevation is hereby declared to be 295 feet MSL.
c.
Height. The true highest altitude of a structure or natural feature (including trees, protruding rocks, or natural ground surface) as measured in feet above mean sea level.
d.
Inner horizontal surface. This surface is a plane, oval in shape, that extends 7,500 feet from the RAFB airfield runway centerline at a height of 150 feet above the established airfield elevation.
e.
Obstruction. Any structure or natural feature (including trees, protruding rocks, or natural ground surface) which exceeds the height limitation defined by the outer horizontal surface established for Robins Air Force Base.
f.
Outer horizontal surface. This surface is a horizontal plane that begins at the outer edge of the conical surface and extends for 30,000 feet at a height of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation.
g.
Structure. Any stationary or mobile object constructed or installed by man, including without limitation, buildings, towers, cranes, smokestacks, earth formations, and overhead transmission lines.
3.
Application. These regulations shall apply to all lands within the City of Byron that are overlaid by the outer horizontal surface established for Robins Air Force Base. These boundaries of these surfaces are shown on the City of Byron, Robins Air Force Base Environs, Protected Height Surfaces Map which by this reference is incorporated herein and which Map is kept on file in the office of the Zoning Enforcement Officer. All development activity within these areas shall comply with the performance standards in subsection 4 of this section in addition to the requirements of the underlying zoning district. Where conflicting standards and requirements exist, the more stringent standards and requirements shall apply.
4.
Performance standards. All development within the areas governed by these height requirements shall comply with the following performance standards:
a.
Height limitation. No structure shall be built which, by virtue of its finished height, would constitute an obstruction within the meaning of these regulations. Where the development or redevelopment of land within the areas affected by these regulations will involve substantial grading and/or site preparation, the zoning enforcement officer may require the applicant to remove any existing obstructions (either natural or manmade) on the site as a condition of development plan approval.
b.
Use restrictions. No use may be made of land or water located within the RAFB approach-departure surfaces that would:
Create or result in electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between Robins Air Force Base and aircraft operating within the affected areas;
Produce or reflect light in a sufficient intensity or manner that would make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other light sources, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the base airport, or otherwise impair visibility in the vicinity of the base. All proposed light sources that could conflict with this requirement (except structure lighting required under FAR part 77) shall be properly shielded or directed away from a pilot's field of vision;
Emit smoke or particulate matter which, in sufficient quantities or concentrations, would impair pilot visibility in the vicinity of the base or clog aircraft engines; or
Attract large flocks of birds, which would constitute a hazard to air navigation in the vicinity of the base. No solid waste disposal facility or landfill may be sited within the areas affected by these regulations.
5.
Review procedures. The standard zoning compliance process for the City of Byron shall apply to the areas affected by these regulations. However, any applicant proposing to construct a structure that is located within the Robins Air Force Base outer horizontal surface and that would exceed 200 feet in height as measured from its tallest point to the finished ground level shall comply with the following review procedures, in addition to the normal zoning compliance process.
a.
FAA Review. The applicant shall submit a copy of the application for FAA review under FAR Part 77, if applicable. A copy of the FAR Part 77 review transmittal letter and application shall be submitted to the planning and zoning commission to document compliance with this requirement. The planning and zoning commission may condition any approval upon FAA approval under FAR Part 77 review.
b.
Robins Air Force Base Civil Engineers Office Review. The City of Byron shall provide a copy of an application for building and zoning compliance within the affected areas, including the development plan and a copy of the FAR Part 77 review transmittal letter and application as required, to the staff of the Middle Georgia Regional Development Center (MGRDC), within five business days of submittal by applicant. The staff of the MGRDC will forward such information to the Robins Air Force Base Civil Engineers Office and any other affected parties for review. The MGRDC will review all comments and provide written recommendations to the zoning enforcement officer and to the planning and zoning commission within ten business days of receipt. The planning and zoning commission may condition any approval upon Robins Air Force Base recommendations.
6.
Submission requirements. An applicant shall submit a preliminary plan in accordance with the applicable requirements of these regulations for any development application that satisfies the special review requirements in subsection 5 of this section. The zoning enforcement officer may require the applicant to submit any or all of the items specified below, if the additional information is necessary to ensure compliance with the performance standards in subsection 4 of this section.
a.
Imaginary surface boundaries. The applicant may be required to delineate on the preliminary plan the boundaries of any primary surface, clear zone surface, approach-departure clearance surfaces, inner horizontal surface, or transitional surfaces, if the location of the aforementioned surface boundaries with respect to the proposed development site or proposed structure locations is in question. All maps prepared to show the location of these boundaries shall be drawn to a scale designated by the zoning enforcement officer.
b.
Location of structures. The applicant may be required to delineate the placement of all existing and proposed buildings and structures, including any existing or proposed tree stands.
c.
Specification of uses. The applicant may be required to specify the proposed uses to occur within each structure or activity area on the development site.
d.
Surface elevation benchmarks. The applicant may be required to show the surface elevation of all structures (above mean sea level) and the maximum height in feet of any structure. For residential subdivisions, the zoning enforcement officer may require the applicant to show surface elevations for the property in five-foot contours with sufficient benchmarks to verify contour elevations.
e.
Narrative description. The applicant may be required to prepare a narrative describing the location of the site, its total acreage, existing character and use; the concept of the proposed development or use, such as proposed residential density; and the relation of the proposed development plan to the comprehensive plan.
7.
Variances. Any applicant wishing to erect a new structure, increase the height of an existing structure, permit the growth of any tree, or commit the property to a use that is not in compliance with the regulations prescribed in these regulations may apply to the zoning review board for a variance. The application for variance must be submitted in the form and manner specified in these regulations, and it must be accompanied by a written determination from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Robins Air Force Base Civil Engineer's Office stating that the proposed structure will not be located within a normal aircraft flight track, that the requested height variance will not be excessive, and that all appropriate measures will be taken by the applicant to prevent any negative impacts on safe navigation within the protected airspace surrounding Robins Air Force Base. Such variances shall be issued only where it is duly determined that a literal application or enforcement of these regulations will result in unnecessary hardship, and the relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit and intent of these regulations. In addition, the zoning review board may solicit the testimony of a qualified professional, at the expense of the applicant, to evaluate the proposed development plans and issue any professional findings or opinions that would assist the board in reaching a decision regarding the variance request. The selection of a qualified professional shall be done by the zoning review board.
(Ord. No. 2003-19, § 4, 1-12-2004)
Section 5 - Nonconforming use.
Intent
Within the districts established by this ordinance, or amendments that may later be adopted, there exists:
a.
Lots,
b.
Structures,
c.
Uses of land and structures, and
d.
Characteristics of use,
which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this ordinance, or future amendment(s). It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
Nonconforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination, shall not be extended or enlarged upon in any manner after passage of this ordinance.
To avoid hardship, this ordinance shall not require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption, or amendment of, this ordinance.
Nonconforming Lots of Record
Any residential lot of record may be used to construct thereon any structure in compliance with the zone in which said lot is located. Such lots shall have a minimum width at the street of 30 feet and must be on city sewerage or have a minimum area of 10,000 square feet if on septic tank and meet all setback, side yard, and lot coverage limitations and off-street parking requirements for the district in which it is located.
Nonconforming Use of Land (or Land with Minor Structures Only)
Where at the time of adoption of this ordinance, lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Ordinance, the use may be continued [so long] as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
a.
No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended, to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
b.
No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the date of adoption of this ordinance.
c.
No such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 30 days (except when governmental action(s) impede(s) access to the premises); any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the district in which the specified land is located.
d.
No additional structure that does not conform to the requirements of this ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
Nonconforming Structures
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
a.
No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in any way, but any structure may be altered to decrease its nonconformity;
b.
Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance;
c.
Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
Nonconforming Uses of Structures or of Structures and Premises in Combination
If lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful and subject to the following provisions:
a.
No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located;
b.
Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building;
c.
If a use is superseded by a permitted use, for the district, the nonconforming use may not then be resumed;
d.
Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, the removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of that land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at the time of destruction;
e.
When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18 months during any three-year period (except when government action(s) impede(s) access to the premises), in [the] structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
Repairs and Maintenance
On any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or repair and/or replacement of nonloadbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming portion of the structure, as the case may be, provided that the cubic area content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
If a nonconforming structure, or portion of a structure, containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.

Section 10 - FH-1 district: flood hazard area.
Purpose and Intent
To restrict or prohibit uses which may be dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flood, or which may cause increased flood heights or velocities; to require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be provided with physical flood protection features at the time of initial construction; to protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes, because of flood hazards; and other public requirements to protect against floods. All plats in a designated flood hazard area must be stamped as according to a designated FEMA map.
District Boundaries
For the purpose of these regulations, floodplain information studies, as prepared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, are made a part of these regulations. The corps of engineer report shall be kept permanently in the office of the zoning enforcement officer, where said reports shall be accessible to the general public. The boundaries of the floodway district shall be synonymous with the limits of an intermediate regional flood as determined in the above said studies.
Permitted Uses
The following open-type uses are permitted in the FH flood hazard district subject to approval of the board of zoning appeals, and to such conditions the said board may specify to protect the public interest:
A.
Adjacent to agricultural and residential districts.
1.
Agricultural uses including crop, nursery stock, and tree farming, truck gardening, livestock grazing, and other agricultural uses which are of the same or a closely similar nature.
2.
Railroads, streets, bridges, and public utility wire and pipe lines for transmission and local distribution purposes.

3.
Parking lots.
4.
Railroads, streets, bridges, and utility lines.
5.
Other similar uses accessory to those permitted in the adjoining district.
D.
Required plans. No permit shall be issued for the construction of any building or structure including railroads, streets, bridges, and utility lines or for any use within the flood hazard district until the plans for such construction or use have been submitted to the zoning review board and approval is given in writing for such construction or use. In its review of plans submitted, the zoning review board shall be guided by the following standards, keeping in mind that the purpose of this district is to prevent encroachment into the floodway which will unduly increase flood heights and endanger life and property.
1.
Any structure or the filling of land permitted shall be of a type not appreciably damaged by floodwaters, provided no structures for human habitation shall be permitted.
2.
Any use permitted shall be in harmony with and not detrimental to the uses permitted in the adjoining district.
3.
Any permitted structures or the filling of land shall be designed, constructed, and placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to and effect upon the flow of water.
4.

5.
Any structure, equipment, or material permitted shall be firmly anchored to prevent it from floating away and thus damaging other structures and threatening to restrict bridge openings and other restricted sections of the stream.
6.
Where in the opinion of the said board topographic data, engineering, and other studies are needed to determine the effects of flooding on a proposed structure or fill and/or the effect of the structure or fill on the flow of water, the said board may require the applicant to submit such data or other studies prepared by competent engineers and other technical people.
7.
The granting of approval of any structure or use shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind or nature by the governing body or the board of zoning appeals or by any officer or employee thereof, or the practicality or safety of any structure or use proposed and shall create no liability upon or cause action against such public body, officer, or employee for any damage that may result pursuant thereto.
3.
[E] Warning of [and] disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as bridge openings restricted by debris. These regulations do not imply that areas outside the flood district boundaries or land uses permitted within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the government or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

ARTICLE IV - WATER RESOURCE PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICTS

[Section] 1. - Purpose.
The intent of this section [article] is to establish minimum development standards and criteria which will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout the City of Byron. It has been determined the wise management of these resources as defined in this section [article] is essential to maintaining the health, safety, general welfare and economic well-being of the public.
[Section] 2. - Establishment of water resource overlay districts.
The City of Byron's water resource overlay districts shall include the following:
Groundwater Recharge Area Overlay District
Wetlands Protection Overlay District
The boundaries of these water resource overlay districts are shown on a set of maps designated as "Water Resource Overlay Districts" and are included as part of the City of Byron's official zoning map, which is on file in the zoning enforcement officer's office located in the Municipal Complex, Moseley Road, Byron, Georgia.
[Section] 3. - Definitions.
In addition to the general definitions provided in this ordinance, the following definitions shall apply to this section [article]:
A.
Aquifer. Any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
B.
Drastic. The standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Document EPA-600-87-035 (Note: The drastic methodology is most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility).
C.
Generalized wetlands map. The current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for the City of Byron, Georgia.
D.
Jurisdictional wetland. An area that needs the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
E.
Jurisdictional wetland determination. A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended.
F.
Pollution susceptibility. The relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area.
G.
Pollution susceptibility map. The relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources using the drastic methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia.)
H.
Recharge area. Any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
I.
Regulated activity. Any activity which will or which may reasonably be expected to result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
J.
Significant recharge areas. Those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition).
K.
Water resource districts. A water resource district is a map overlay which imposes a set of requirements in addition to those of the underlying zoning district.
L.
Wetlands. Those areas inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation and hydrological conditions involving a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.
[Section] 4. - Groundwater recharge area overlay district.
4.1.
Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides, sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
4.2.
Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.
4.3.
District delineation. The groundwater recharge area overlay district is delineated according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition)." Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the "Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 edition." Said maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance.
4.4.
Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the groundwater recharge area protection overlay district. The following are additional requirements for specific uses:
(A)
New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt provided they comply with all federal requirements.
(B)
New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within:
(1)
A high pollution susceptibility area;
(2)

  Notes to tables
EXPAND
Section A. The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (three- or four-bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc., are proposed for construction or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the Peach County board of health will require larger lots to assure usable soil area.
Section B. The Peach County board of health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features.
Section C. Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively.
Section D. The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads; easements (such as power line or pipeline) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system; bodies of water; land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water; and similar limiting factors.
Section E. There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent city zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met.
Section F. The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine the square footage of the lot needed, X, use the following formula:
X = 5,000 gal/day / 1,200 gal/acre/day
= 4.17 acres
= 4.17 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre
= 181,500 ft 2 area of land needed
Likewise, for a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine the square footage of the lot needed, Y, for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula:
Y = 5,000 gal/day / 600 gal/acre/day
= 8.33 acres
= 8.33 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre
= 363,000 ft 2 area of land needed
  [Section] 5. - Wetlands protection overlay district.
5.1.
Findings of fact. The wetlands within the City of Byron are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study; and recreational opportunities.
5.2.
Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas.
5.3.
District delineation. The wetlands protection overlay district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Byron, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the "generalized wetlands map" and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this ordinance, together with all explanatory matter thereon as attached thereto.
The generalized wetlands map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City of Byron and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
5.4.
Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use except those identified in section 5.5 shall be allowed within the wetlands protection district without a development permit from the City of Byron. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary as determined by the zoning enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
5.5.
Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right within the wetland protection overlay district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging as provided herein. (These activities listed in this section are exempted from section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.)
(1)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(2)
Conservation or preservation [of] soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the State of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(3)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(4)
The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia department of agriculture.
(5)
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed, and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed.
(6)
Education, scientific research and nature trails.
5.6.
Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in a wetland overlay district:
(1)
Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants.
(2)
Hazardous or sanitary landfills.
(Ord. No. 2001-17, 12-10-2001)
APPENDIX Z-1 - REGULATIONS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING AND OFF-STREET LOADING
The off-street parking, loading, and unloading requirements shall apply to all new structures or buildings, or any existing buildings that may be substantially altered after the date of adoption of this ordinance.
1.
Change in intensity of use. Whenever a building or structure erected prior to or after the date of adoption of this ordinance undergoes any increase in number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, number of employees, or other unit of measure specified in this ordinance for required parking or loading facilities, and when such increase would result in a requirement for additional parking or loading facilities as specified in this ordinance, such additional facilities shall be provided accordingly; except, that no building or structure erected prior to the date of adoption of this ordinance shall be required to provide parking or loading facilities unless the additional facilities amount to an increase of 25 percent, in which case, parking or loading spaces shall be provided on the basis of the additional units of measurement (as mentioned in this subsection) of the new use of the altered or expanded existing use.
When a building or structure shall undergo any decrease in the number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of measurement specified in this ordinance for required parking or loading facilities, and when it would result in a requirement for fewer total parking or loading spaces as specified in this ordinance, parking or loading facilities may be reduced accordingly, provided that the remaining parking and loading facilities shall at least equal or exceed the parking or loading requirements of this ordinance as applied to the modified building or structure.
2.
Minimum distance and setbacks. Parking spaces shall not be located within the area prescribed for front yard setbacks. The zoning enforcement officer may waive this requirement, on a case-by-case basis, if the property owner, or his representative, presents a site plan showing a landscaped strip, a minimum of five feet in width, along the front property line when applying for a permit for the construction of the building and/or parking lot, and then installs the planted landscaped strip as illustrated on the site plan. The zoning enforcement officer shall withhold final inspection approval of all the improvements on the property until the landscaping is installed and complete. Such landscaping shall be continually maintained by a property owner. Any wall or fence erected in place of a landscaping strip shall observe the minimum setbacks for that zoning district.
3.
Design of parking lots. A parking lot for five or more vehicles must meet the following criteria prior to issuance of a permit for the construction of the lot:
a.
A minimum of ten percent of the parking lot area shall be landscaped; a landscaped strip, a minimum of five feet wide, must be provided on each side which is adjacent to streets. All lots shall also be effectively screened by landscaping on each side which adjoins or fronts property situated in any residential district. Such landscaped strip shall be dense enough to shield the cars. The landscaping shall be maintained in good condition by the property owner. Required setback areas shall not be paved except for those areas specifically necessary for entrance and exitways. The zoning review board may waive or reduce the landscaping requirements in cases of extreme hardship. In lieu of the landscaping requirement, a fence or wall must be provided, which must be approved by the zoning review board.
b.
No application for a building permit for a new, enlarged, or altered, structure, or improvement of use, shall be approved unless accompanied by a plot plan drawn to scale, showing the required off-street automobile parking facilities and improvements as specified in this section nor shall a permit be issued for the improvement of a parking area to serve as an accessory use to an existing building or buildings until a plot plan drawn to scale has been submitted in accordance with this section. Prior to approval, the plot plan will be reviewed and approved by a certified civil engineer for sufficient drainage, as well as entry and exit points, and by the zoning enforcement officer for landscaping and to insure compliance with all the requirements of this ordinance, including the adequacy of the parking lot to accomplish its purpose.
c.
Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking lot shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining properties. The parking lot must be graveled or paved with asphalt, concrete, brick, or other hard surface material approved by the city's agent or zoning enforcement officer.
d.
Landscaping, including trees, shall be required within the interior of parking lots (in addition to the perimeter landscaping) when the parking lot area exceeds 20,000 square feet. Periodic maintenance shall be required.
e.
Landscaping shall not obstruct the visibility of automobiles at intersections, or entry and exit points.
f.
All parking lots shall have appropriate entrance and exit signs. No advertising signs for uses conducted on the premises shall be permitted on or in conjunction with these entrance and exit signs.
4.
Certificate of occupancy or use permits. No certificate of occupancy or use permit will be issued upon completion of any building, or addition, which would require an increase in parking space or off-street loading and unloading space, unless and until all off-street parking and load space requirements, as shown on the approved plans, or which are made a part of the building permit, shall be completed and determined by the zoning enforcement official to be ready for use.
5.
Loading space. As required in this ordinance, the space supplied for such off-street loading and unloading purposes shall not be construed as supplying required off-street parking space.
6.
Location of parking space. Parking spaces provided pursuant to this section must be graveled or hard surfaced, and properly drained. The spaces shall be located on the same property as the principal building, or on a properly zoned lot within 300 feet of the building. Such distance measured from the nearest point of the parking lot to the nearest boundary of the property on which the building is located that said parking lot is required to serve. In determining automobile parking spaces, if not shown by actual site plan and count, 300 sq. ft. of gross area per parking space will be utilized in computing the number of spaces necessary.
7.
Joint, use of off-street parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent the joint use of off-street parking or off-street loading space for two or more buildings or uses if the total of such spaces, when used together, is not less than the sum of the requirements for the various individual uses computed separately in accordance with this section.
8.
Use of required off-street parking by another building. No part of an off-street parking lot required for any building or use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this ordinance shall be included as a part of an off-street parking area similarly required for another building or use, unless the type of structure indicates that the periods of usage of such structures will not be simultaneous, or, unless the size of said off-street parking lot is sufficient to comply with the provisions of this ordinance.
9.
Remote parking lots—incumbered. Where the provisions of off-street parking for a building or other use established after the adoption of this ordinance involves one or more parcels, or tracts, or lots of land that are not a part of the plot on which the principal use is situated, the applicant for a permit for the principal use shall include these tracts or lots of land as meeting their parking requirements of the principal use.
When a principal use has specified a remote parking lot in accordance with these regulations outlined herein to provide the required minimum parking spaces, the occupational license for the principal use will not be renewed by the city until the owner, and/or operator, of the principal use presents sufficient evidence to the city that the required parking spaces will be provided for the same period as the license.
The applicant shall deposit the necessary recording fee, and upon the issuance of a building permit, the zoning enforcement official shall cause said legal instrument of incumbrance to be recorded in the office of the city clerk.
10.
Accessory parking in residential areas. A lot, or lots, separated by a common boundary from an office or commercial district, but located in an R-2 or R-3 district, may be used as a free parking lot, or lots, to service the contiguous and adjoining commercial use, or uses, or as otherwise permitted by this ordinance, provided that:
a.
No advertising signs of any type are erected in the area;
b.
The setback from the front property line shall be the same as for the district in which the lot, or lots, are located;
c.
All automobile parking lots shall be effectively screened on each side which adjoins or fronts property situated in any residential or multiple-family dwelling district by a wall, fence, or densely planted hedge. Such wall, fence, or hedge shall be not less than four feet in height, and shall be maintained in good condition;
d.
No structure shall be erected in such area.
11.
Waiving of paving requirements. Where light or infrequent use of the parking lot may make it desirable to waive the paving requirement, the city council may, upon appeal of the lot owner, waive this requirement.
Should the use of this lot change appreciably such that an unpaved lot is no longer adequate, the city council may require the lot to conform with the requirements in this section.
12.
Off-street loading and unloading regulations. On the same premises with every building, structure, or part thereof, erected and occupied for the uses of manufacturing, warehouse storage, food processing or wholesale distribution plant, department store, wholesale store, market, hotel, hospital, mortuary, laundry, dry cleaning, or other uses similarly involving the receipt or distribution by vehicles, of materials or merchandise, there shall be provided and maintained on the lot adequate space for the standing, loading, and unloading services, in order to avoid undue interference with public use of the streets or alleys. Such space, unless adequately provided elsewhere on the lot, shall include a minimum of 12 by 55 feet load space, with a 14-foot minimum height clearance, for every 20,000 square feet or fraction thereof in excess of 3,000 sq. ft. of building space used for the above-mentioned purposes, or for 20,000 sq. ft., or fraction thereof, in excess of 3,000 sq. ft. of land used for the above-mentioned purposes,
APPENDIX Z-II - REGULATIONS FOR SIGNS AND ADVERTISING
The provisions of this section govern the location, size, setback, and height of signs in each of the zoning districts established in these regulations so as to insure safe construction, light, air, and open space; to reduce hazards at intersections; to prevent the accumulation of trash; and to protect property values of the entire community.

(Ord. No. 2003-11, 8-11-2003)
PART V - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
ARTICLE I -

Section 1 - General principles of design.
Suitability of Land
Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, and erosion, as determined by the city's engineer and land determined by the planning commission to be unsuitable for development shall not be platted for any uses as may continue such conditions or increase the danger to health, safety, life, or property unless steps are taken to eliminate these existing hazards.
Access
a.
Every subdivision and every lot within the subdivision shall be served by a publicly dedicated street, except as otherwise stated in these regulations.
b.
When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets.
c.
No subdivision shall be designed so as to completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land.
Conformance to the Master Comprehensive Plan
a.
All proposed subdivisions shall conform to the master comprehensive plan, zoning and subdivision regulations, and development policies in effect at the time of submission to the planning commission.
b.
In subdivisions related to or affecting any state or federally numbered highway, the approval of the state department of transportation is required by the planning commission.
c.
Where features of the comprehensive plan (other than minor streets and collector streets) such as school sites, parks, arterial streets, major thoroughfares, and other public spaces are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, or when these features have not been anticipated by the comprehensive plan and planning policy, but are considered essential by the planning commission, such features shall be reserved by the subdivider. Whenever such reserved land, or any portion thereof, is not acquired, optioned or condemned by the appropriate public agency within a one-year period from the date of recording the subdivision, the subdivider may claim the original reservation, or portion thereof, and subdivide it in a manner suitable to the provisions of these rules and regulations.
d.
The planning commission may waive the above-mentioned reservation requirements whenever the public body responsible for land acquisition executes a written release stating that such a planned feature is not being acquired.
e.
Whenever the plat proposes the dedication of land to public use and the planning commission or the appropriate agency finds that such land is not required or suitable for public use, the planning commission may either refuse to approve said plat or it may require the rearrangements of lots to include such land.
Zoning and Other Regulations
Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions as contained in these regulations and those contained in other official regulations or resolutions, the most restrictive regulations shall apply.
Modifications to Subdivision Principles and Standards of Design
a.
Modifications of the provisions contained in these rules and regulations may be recommended by the planning commission. The city council shall be the granting authority for such modifications. These modifications may be granted in specific cases when it is determined that undue hardship will result from strict compliance. This determination shall be based on the fact that unusual topographical or other exceptional conditions require such modifications. Furthermore, the granting of such modifications by the city council will not adversely affect the general public, create any public liability, or nullify the intent of these regulations; provided further that any such modifications shall not be made in instances where the hardship is a result of the actions of the subdivider.
b.
Application for any modifications must be filed in writing with necessary supporting documents with the planning commission by the subdivider and shall explain in detail the reasons and facts supporting the application. Should any modification be granted by the city, the subdivider shall be notified in writing and such notice and modification shall be made part of the subdivision plats and plans and also the records of the planning commission.
Name of Subdivision
The name of the subdivision shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision, except where the subdivision is a section or part of a larger contiguous subdivision being developed by the same subdivider in phases, sections, or stages. In this case, the name of the overall subdivision can be used for each phase, stage, or section, but the phase or section number must also be included as part of the same.
ARTICLE II -

Section 1 - Design standards.
Required Design Standards
The design standards set forth in this article shall be observed in all plats which are presented before the planning commission for approval. In addition, those standards required for the installation of subdivision improvements as stated in section 2 of this article are required when applicable.
Streets
a.
The arrangements, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the city's major thoroughfare plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
b.
Where such is not shown in the city's major thoroughfare plan the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
(1)
Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets in surrounding areas at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum width.
(2)
Conform to a plan for neighborhood streets that shall be approved or adopted by the planning commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other existing streets make it impracticable.
c.
Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
d.
Where a subdivision contains a dead-end street other than a cul-de-sac, the planning commission may require the subdivider to provide a temporary vehicle turnaround within the right-of-way, when the planning commission considers such to be necessary for effective traffic circulation.
e.
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the planning commission may require marginal access streets, double frontage lots with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property lines, deep lots with rear service drives, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through traffic and local traffic.
f.
Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or limited access highway right-of-way, the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or industrial purpose in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.

Storm drainage. A stormwater management plan shall be prepared and submitted to the city for review and approval in accordance with the City of Byron stormwater management ordinance.
An adequate storm drainage system shall be provided. Storm drainage systems include curb and gutter, storm drainage inlets, pipes, culverts, driveway pipes, headwalls and ditches. Design of the storm drainage system shall be based on the 25-year storm frequency except as otherwise noted herein, and shall have adequate capacity for stormwater generated on site by the proposed subdivision and for stormwater generated off site upstream of the proposed subdivision. Individual segments of storm drainage systems shall be designed to perform as integral parts of the overall system in conformance with the stormwater management plan.
Roadway culverts shall be designed to pass the 100-year storm event such that the maximum headwater at the culvert inlet will not exceed the elevation of the bottom of the road subgrade at the low point. Driveway culverts shall be sized to pass the 50-year storm event without overtopping the driveway at the low point.
On roads constructed with curb and gutter, a sufficient number of inlets shall be provided to remove stormwater from the roadway such that the spread of stormwater in the street does not extend further than the middle of the first travel lane during the 25-year storm event.
c.
Installation of utilities. After grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied, all of the underground utilities—water mains, sewer mains, gas mains, and all service connections related thereto—shall be installed completely and approved throughout the length of the street. All driveways for houses to be built by the subdivider shall be cut and drained. Where the utility mains are off the pavements, the subdivider may elect to omit the installation of service connections providing that at such time as these service connections are needed, they may be jacked across the street without breaking or weakening the existing pavement.
d.
Slopes and shoulder improvements. The minimum ratio for all fill and cut slopes (including drainage ditches) shall be two to one and the minimum width for all shoulders from back edge to the curb, if installed, shall be eight feet. All shoulders shall slope one-half inch to the foot. When all construction is completed, all slopes and shoulders shall be cleared of all rubbish and shall have a stand of perennial grass to prevent undue erosion, either by sprigging or seeding.
Roadway Surfacing and Paving
a.
Minimum pavement width. All minor residential streets paved after the adoption of these regulations shall have a minimum pavement width of 23 feet from inside of curb and gutter to inside of curb and gutter, or 24 feet from edge of pavement to edge of pavement if no curb and gutters are installed. The outside pavement for a cul-de-sac turnaround shall be a minimum diameter of 80 feet. All other street width pavements shall be determined by the planning commission as required by the intended or desired street function. Minimum standards are provided in charts I and II of article II.
b.
Pavement breaks for utility connections. When it is necessary for a subdivider, or any utility company, to break existing pavement for the installation of utilities, for drainage facilities, or for any other purpose, the subdivider, or utility company, shall be financially responsible for the repair of the pavement. The pavement shall be repaired in accordance with the specifications stated in these regulations for construction of streets.
c.
Curbs and gutters. Either the regular six-inch or four-inch roll-over concrete curbs and gutters with a minimum overall width of 24 inches shall be constructed on all residential class I streets. Commercial and industrial class I streets shall require the regular six-inch curb. Cement concrete valley gutter shall be permitted across minor residential streets at street intersections only when no storm sewers are available as determined by the zoning enforcement officer. Valley gutters shall be at least six feet in width. Whenever driveway openings are provided for lots abutting the street, the driveway shall be six inches thick and a minimum of ten feet in width at the sidewalk or at the street right-of-way line. The driveway shall have a five-foot radius at the curbline for low density residential uses, and a ten- to 20-foot radius for all other uses.
d.
Curb markings for utility connections. Where utilities are enter under the street pavement, a letter identifying the particular utility (W-water, S-sewer, G-gas) shall be etched into the curb. Such letter shall be approximately three inches in height.
e.
Grassed medians. No curb shall be required for a grassed median on residential streets providing such medians are designed to slope towards the outside curb of a street or contain an adequate drainage system within the median.
Installation of Utilities
a.
Water. Water mains for both domestic use and fire protection (six-inch minimum) shall be properly connected with the public water system, or with an alternate water supply approved by the county health department. The lines shall be constructed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots shown on the subdivision plat.
b.
Sewer. A publicly connected sanitary sewer system shall be installed when any portion of the subdivision is within 500 feet of an existing trunk or collector sewer line. Where lots are not connected with a sanitary sewer system, they must contain adequate area for the installation of approved septic tank and disposal fields approved by the county health department. All sewer facilities shall be installed in accordance with the standards of the environmental protection division of the State of Georgia department of natural resources.
c.
Gas. When gas mains are connected with a gas distribution system, the lines shall be installed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots shown on the subdivision plats. The gas lines shall be constructed in conformance with the technical standards as established by the planning commission which shall be in accordance with the utility owner.
Sidewalks and Street Signs
a.
Sidewalks. When provided or at the requirement of the commission and unless otherwise specified, sidewalks shall be four inches thick with a minimum width of four feet. A ten-foot grass planting strip shall be provided between the back of the curb and the sidewalk along collector and arterial streets, and a three-foot strip along minor streets. For class II streets, the sidewalk shall be located on the right-of-way line side of the drainage ditch located parallel to the street. No planting strip shall be required between marginal access roads and sidewalks. All sidewalks shall slope one-fourth inch to the foot toward the pavement.
b.
Sidewalks in subdivisions. Sidewalks shall be provided in the following types of subdivisions:
(1)
In all commercial zones;
(2)
In all subdivisions within one-half mile of a school or other facilities likely to attract pedestrian traffic at such volume that the welfare of the public requires the installation of sidewalks.
c.
Location of street signs. All streets shall be designed by name on a metal street signpost approved by the planning commission with such metal post having nameplates of metal set one above the other with a clearance of seven feet. The post shall be so located as to be visible for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. At cross-street intersections, two signposts shall be located diagonally across the intersection from each other. Only one street signpost shall be required at T-street intersections.
Administrative Procedures
The administrative procedures for installing the subdivision improvements required herein shall be as follows:
a.
When construction may begin. Construction and installation of any required public improvements as described in these regulations shall not begin until the planning commission has given preliminary plat approval for the new subdivision.
b.
Inspections and approval. During the construction and installation of the required public improvements, the zoning enforcement officer shall from time to time make field inspections and supervise the work as predetermined and agreed upon by the zoning enforcement officer and the subdivider. After completion of all the construction and installation of the required public improvements, and if the work has met the specifications as described herein, the zoning enforcement officer shall notify the subdivider in writing of the approval of said work.
c.
Official acceptance by the city. The city shall officially accept the completed work on the construction and installation of required public improvements not less than one year from the date of the written acceptance by the zoning enforcement officer, but not before approval by the planning commission of the final plat and/or any "as-built" plans which may be required.
d.
Cashier's checks. If the subdivider does not wish to construct and install any or all of the required public improvements as described herein prior to submitting the subdivision plat to the planning commission for final approval, a cashier's check shall be required, such check being equal to the estimated cost of construction. When the work has been completed satisfactorily, the city shall release 90 percent of the funds with a letter of approval to the subdivider. The remaining ten percent shall apply toward the subdivider's required maintenance bond. The cost of any corrective work required shall be deducted from the funds.
e.
Maintenance of completed work. The subdivider shall maintain his completed work until the official acceptance by the city as described above. The subdivider shall then be required to sign a maintenance agreement with the city for one year. A maintenance bond is to be posted by the subdivider in an amount equal to ten percent of the construction cost. During the maintenance period the zoning enforcement officer shall make periodic inspections and notify the subdivider of necessary corrections. At the end of the maintenance period, the zoning enforcement officer shall make a final inspection and report his findings to the city. Necessary corrections not made by the subdivider will be completed by the city. The cost of making such corrections shall be deducted from the maintenance funds and/or collected from the subdivider and the bonding company. If the work is acceptable at the end of the maintenance period, the maintenance bond shall expire and/or any remaining funds shall be released to the subdivider.

Section I. - Purposes.
This ordinance is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the City of Byron, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the City of Byron so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the City of Byron as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this ordinance shall:
(1)
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities in the City of Byron;
(2)
Protect the City of Byron's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities;
(3)
Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
(4)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennae;
(5)
Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city;
(6)
Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and
(7)
Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use.

Section VI. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities.
(1)
General requirements for all telecommunications facilities: The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance unless the governing authority reduces the standards if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby:
(a)
Building codes and safety standards: To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The result of such inspection shall be provided to the zoning official. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia.
(b)
Regulatory compliance:
1.
All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations.
2.
Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months.
3.
An applicant or owner must comply with all applicable provisions of Part IV, Article II, section 4, special structure height requirements of the Byron Zoning Ordinance and must provide to the zoning official certification from Robins Air Force Base that the telecommunications tower will not interfere with the operations of the Base, and shall comply with all other applicable sections of the Byron Zoning Ordinance.
4.
Failure to bring towers and antenna into compliance with such standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for removal of the tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia.
(c)
Security: All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. A black or nonobtrusive vinyl clad chain-link fence or wall not less than eight feet in height from finished grade shall be provided around each communication tower or antenna. Barbed wire shall not be used along the top of the fence or wall. Access to the tower or antenna shall be through a locked gate.
(d)
Lighting: Illumination of the telecommunications facilities shall be provided as required by the FCC and FAA, or other federal or state agencies having jurisdiction regarding air traffic control or other illumination requirements. Security lighting or other lighting not required by the aforementioned agencies, but acceptable to them, may require approval by the zoning enforcement officer to ensure the least disturbance possible to the surrounding uses and views.
(e)
Advertising: No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this ordinance are met.
(f)
Visual impact:
1.
Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
2.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background.
3.
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
4.
Telecommunications facilities shall not be sited where they negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
5.
Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(g)
Landscaping:
1.
Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property.
2.
Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound.
3.
Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
4.
Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the governing authority to assure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this section.
5.
The governing authority may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes; for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms; or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the governing authority.
(h)
Maintenance impacts: Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street.
(i)
Principal, accessory and joint uses:
1.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility.
2.
Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area.
(j)
Lot size and setbacks:
1.
The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities.
i.
Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any residential property line and all public rights-of-way.
2.
For antennas attached to the roof of a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot-high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact.
(k)
Change of ownership: Upon the transfer of ownership of an interest in any tower, antenna or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the tower permittee shall notify the governing authority of the transaction in writing within 30 days.
(l)
Time limit of project completion: Once a communication tower or antenna is approved, a permit shall be obtained within one year and the project shall be completed within one year of approval by the city.
