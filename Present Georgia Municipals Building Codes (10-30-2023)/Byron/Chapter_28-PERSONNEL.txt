It shall be the duty of each employee to maintain high standards of conduct, cooperation, efficiency, and economy in his/her work with the City. Whenever work habits, attitude, production, or personal conduct of any employee falls below the accepted norm for all employees, supervisors should point out those behavioral deficiencies to the employee at the time they are observed or a reasonable time thereafter. Corrections and suggestions should be presented in a constructive and helpful manner in an effort to elicit cooperation and goodwill from all employees.

Whenever possible, oral and/or written warnings shall precede formal discipline.

However, under no circumstances shall any retired participant be entitled at one time to more than one type of retirement benefit granted under the plan.
Article V, section 2. Early retirement benefit. A participant, upon retirement on participant's early retirement date, shall receive a monthly retirement benefit under which payment shall commence on the first day of the month following the participant's early retirement date and shall be payable on the first day of each month thereafter during the lifetime of the participant.
