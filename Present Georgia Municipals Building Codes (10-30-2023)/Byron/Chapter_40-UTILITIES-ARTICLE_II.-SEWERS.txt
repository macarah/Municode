Sec. 40-90. - Maintenance responsibility for sewer lines.
modified
(a)
The city has maintenance responsibility for pumping stations, sewer manholes, mainlines connecting the manholes, and service connections at the main. Unlike water lines that have meters to establish boundaries of responsibility, sewer lines do not have meters. Therefore, city responsibility for service connections is established at the mainline, and if mainlines are located under street pavement, a distance from the mainline extending to the street edge.
(b)
The homeowner/business owner has maintenance responsibility for the service line which connects the building to the city mainline. The first action to correct a sewer problem is for the owner to arrange for someone other than the city to check the fixtures within the building, then the service line up to the connection at the main, at or under the street. A sewer blockage in the service line is to be cleared by the owner or person contracted to do so. In no case will a homeowner or contractor be allowed to dig at or under the street pavement to repair a service line.
(c)
For all newly installed service connections, a cleanout port will be located at or near the street edge to facilitate future maintenance of the service line connection at the main sewer line.
(d)
Repair of defective customer services lines.
(1)
The director of public works, or his or her designated representatives, are hereby empowered at their discretion to search out, locate, and ascertain the existence of any "customer service line" which, due to its condition, is allowing the infiltration of ground water, surface water, or other undesirable infiltrates into the sewage system of the city.
(2)
Upon identifying any such line, the director of public works or his or her designated representatives shall ascertain the owner of said lines and also the customer utilizing said line, if different from said customer, and shall immediately notify the customer, of the defects in said line and shall make demand, pursuant to the terms of this section that said defects be corrected within 30 days of actual delivery of the written demand. The director of public works shall advise the owner and the said customer, if different from the owner, that if said corrective action is not taken within the 30-day period of time, that sewer service through said line shall be terminated.
(3)
If, after the expiration of the aforesaid time, it is determined that appropriate corrective action has not been taken, then the director of public works shall cause the service through said defective line to be terminated by closing the same at its connection with the lines of the city, except that no such termination of service shall be done or effectuated until prior notice thereof has been given to the owner, customer, and occupants of the facilities served.
(4)
If, due to economic hardship, act of God, providential cause, or unavailability of material or any other legitimate reason, the affected parties are unable to effectuate the necessary repairs within the time above allotted, then and in that event the director of public works or his or her representatives shall grant to any such person, upon the request of such person, an extension of 30 days, and if said conditions continue, the said director of public works, or his or her representatives shall be empowered to grant an additional extension for 30 more days; however, extensions beyond the aforesaid cumulative extension period of 90 days shall not be granted unless the facts and circumstances are brought before the city council of the city at one of its regular meetings and such additional extension is granted by the city council by appropriate resolution.

(3)
Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5 or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment and personnel of the sewage works.

Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste- or odor-producing substances, in concentrations exceeding limits which may be established by the director of public works as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal or other agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.
(7)
Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the director of public works in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.

(a)
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewer, which waters or wastes contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection 40-111(b) and which, in the judgement of the director of public works, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the director of public works may:
(1)
Reject the wastes;
(2)
Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;
(3)
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
(4)
Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of section 40-119.

modified
When required by the director of public works, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole, together with necessary meters and other appurtenances, in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the director of public works. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at such owner's expense and shall be maintained by such owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.

The city shall have the right to take such samples of waters and wastes and to make such tests, measurements and analyses as are necessary to enforce this division.
(b)
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this division shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided pursuant to section 40-116 or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.
