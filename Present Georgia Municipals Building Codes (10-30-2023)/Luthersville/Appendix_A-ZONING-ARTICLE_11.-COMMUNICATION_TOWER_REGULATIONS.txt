(Ord. No. 2001-07, § 11.1, 4-10-2001)
Sec. 11.2. - Purpose.
The purpose of this appendix is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this appendix are to:
1.
Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the City of Luthersville;
2.
Encourage strongly the joint use of existing tower sites;
3.
Encourage builders of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the city is minimal;
4.
Encourage builders of towers and antennas to configure them in a way to minimize the adverse visual impact to the city;
5.
Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the city quickly, effectively and efficiently.
(Ord. No. 2001-07, § 11.2, 4-10-2001)
Sec. 11.3. - Aesthetics.
The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the installation of all towers and of all antennas governed by this appendix.
1.
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
2.
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping which will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
3.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color or colors that is identical to, or is closely comparable with, the supporting structure and/or surrounding area so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
4.
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the City Council of Luthersville may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design which would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
(Ord. No. 2001-07, § 11.3, 4-10-2001)
Sec. 11.4. - General.
1.
Height limitations. The height limitations set forth in this section of the zoning ordinance as applicable to buildings and structures shall not apply to towers and antenna. Towers and antenna shall be governed by the special use permit procedures set forth herein.
2.
Tower height threshold. These standards shall only be applicable to antenna and towers in excess of 35 feet in height.
3.
The city council may consider for approval a site plan specific request which is in substantial conformance with the requirements listed herein.
(Ord. No. 2001-07, § 11.4, 4-10-2001)
Sec. 11.5. - Special use permit.
Special land use permit shall be required for all television, land mobile, communication, microwave, radio transmission antennas and towers. All such structures shall be located only on property which is zoned General Industry (GI), provided that a special use permit is issued by the city in accordance with this article.
Federally licensed amateur radio antennas under 70 feet in height are exempt from special use permit requirements.
(Ord. No. 2001-07, § 11.5, 4-10-2001)
Sec. 11.6. - Requirements.
1.
All towers and antennas in excess of 70 feet located in an industrial zone shall be set back according to front yard requirements stated in Table 5.1. Towers with trigger links shall be set back one-half the distance of the length of the tower when located in areas zoned general commercial and set back the full height of the tower if located in any residential or rural development zoned district.
2.
At the time of filing the applicants for a tower, the applicant shall provide a site plan and information regarding topography, coverage zone, and tower height requirements.
3.
Shared usage of towers and antennas facilities is encouraged, and towers shall be designed to accommodate such uses.
4.
Accessory structures shall be limited to usages associated with operation of the antennas or towers and shall be appropriate in scale and intensity.
5.
All towers and antennas shall be equipped with an anti-climbing device, such as a six-foot wall, fence or other appropriate devices to prevent unauthorized access.
6.
All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Communications Commission or such governing agency guidelines as may be established by named agencies. All towers and antennas must be updated and brought into conformity with such standards and regulations within six months of their adoption. The failure to comply with this provision shall be grounds for the city to require removal or re-permitting of the antennas or tower at the owner's expense.
7.
At the time of application for building permit, the plans for tower or antenna construction shall be certified by an independent registered structural engineer as meeting all current safety and design standards of all applicable codes. Cost of engineering evaluation shall be the responsibility of the individual or corporation applying for the building permit.
8.
Applicants are required to explore and fully utilize existing tower and antenna space and are required to bear an equitable share of capital, operating and other expenses in connection with such shared usage.
9.
Nonresidential sites are encouraged for tower location where possible land use of platted lots in existing subdivisions are discouraged.
10.
In addition, all such towers and antennas shall be designed to minimize visual and scenic impact when located on slopes greater than 15 percent or on top of such slopes.
11.
Any tower approved under the provisions of this appendix which is not utilized by any communications service provider for any communications related purpose for a period of 12 consecutive months shall lose any privilege of special use previously granted by the City Council of Luthersville and must therefore be re-submitted for approval prior to use for any purpose not permitted by the existing zoning.
