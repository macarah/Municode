For every subsequent preventable false alarm that occurs at the same premises within a period of 30 consecutive days, a fine shall be assessed in the amount of up to $250.00. If the responsible person for the property at which an alarm occurs fails to provide one or more current key holders, a fine of up to $100.00 will be assessed against the person responsible for the property. If a key holder refuses to respond when requested by the police department, a fine of up to $250.00 will be assessed against the person responsible for the property, and the responsible person for the property is liable for any damages and costs of incidents or emergencies that may occur within or to his property, and/or to any other impacted property.

The police chief or police officer on duty is authorized to issue the appropriate citations.

The false alarm violations set forth herein shall not apply if the false alarms were caused by severe weather, lightning strikes, power surges, or any other potential sources for which the responsible party has no control. The police officer in charge shall have the responsibility to determine if a false alarm was due to foreseeable and preventable conditions or if it was due to extraordinary reasons beyond the control of the responsible party. Additionally, if the property or alarm monitoring company from which an alarm is received provides appropriate information to verify that the alarm is false prior to the arrival of the first responding police unit, the on-scene officer will confirm the accuracy of the information and the cause of the incident. Absent other infractions, the first two such alarms will be documented but no citation will be issued in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.
