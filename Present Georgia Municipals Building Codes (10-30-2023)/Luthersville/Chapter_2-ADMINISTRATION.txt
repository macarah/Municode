The purpose of this statement of financial policy of the city is to serve as a foundation for long- and short-term planning, facilitate decision-making, and provide direction to the city council and operational staff for handling the city's day-to-day financial business. Because of the diverse nature of the city's departments and committees, having written defined financial policies minimizes the risk of developing conflicting or inconsistent goals and objectives which could have a negative impact on the overall financial condition of the city.

(d)
All state or federal funds received by the city are hereby continually appropriated in the exact amounts and for the purposes authorized and directed by the state or federal government making the grant.

(b)
The budget ordinance shall make appropriations in such sums as the city council may deem enough, whether or not those sums are the same as those presented in the mayor's proposed budget.

(c)
The city council may adopt supplementary appropriations as set forth in this division.
(1)
In addition to the appropriations made by the municipal appropriations ordinance and amendments thereto, the city council may make additional appropriations by an affirmative vote in favor of an ordinance making such a change.

Sec. 2-139. - Municipal fund balance.
(a)
The city shall maintain a prudent level of financial resources to protect against financial disruptions of the city and to provide services in the case of temporary revenue shortfalls, unpredicted one-time expenditures, natural disasters or emergencies and to maintain sufficient working capital and cash flow to meet current financial needs at all times.
(b)
The city's definition of fund balance for its governmental fund types will conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as applicable to governments, including all relevant Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) requirements. For the purposes of this division, and in accordance with GASB 54, the following terms shall be defined as follows:
Assigned means financial resources of which use is restricted by management based on the intended use of those resources per the city council of the city.
Committed means financial resources of which use is restricted by action of the city council which will remain binding unless removed in the same matter creating the restriction.
Non-spendable means financial resources that will never convert to cash, that will not convert to cash soon enough to affect the current period, or that must be maintained intact pursuant to legal or contractual requirements.
Restricted means financial resources that are subject to externally enforceable legal restrictions, such as debt covenants, federal or state grant requirements, private donors/contributors, or other governmental entities.
Unassigned means any residual net resources available after consideration of designation of the non-spendable, restricted, committed or assigned fund balance.
(c)
The city's general fund may maintain all five components of the fund balance.
(d)
The lowest level of fund balance classification for the city's special revenue funds will be committed fund balance. Committed fund balance will be used first when paying expenses, unless the expense is for purchases which were listed as being used from restricted fund balance classification.
(e)
The lowest level of fund balance classification for the city's capital project funds will be assigned fund balance for the funding of specific projects. An assigned fund balance will be spent first, unless the expenditure is tied to a restricted fund balance amount. Once a project is completed, any fund balance remaining will be transferred back to the fund which was the original funding source.
(f)
Debt service funds will only classify fund balances as non-spendable or restricted. When debt expenses are paid, the city will use restricted fund balance first. All debt services funds will maintain a fund balance at a level to retire the debt. Once all debt is retired, or the fund balance is enough to retire all remaining debt, any remaining fund balance will be transferred to other city funds or projects as directed by the governing body.
(g)
During the transition period, the city will maintain a balanced budget, and thereafter, it shall maintain as an ending unassigned fund balance for its general fund at least 2½ months of its prior fiscal year's actual amounts of budgetary basis operating expenditures of its general fund as reflected in the city's most recent annual audit report's statement of "Budgetary Comparison Schedule - General Fund." If governmental accounting standards change which eliminate the inclusion of the "Budgetary Comparison Schedule - General Fund," a statement of similar nature should be used in its place.
(1)
If the general fund's unassigned fund balance falls below the minimum targeted level as defined in this policy, the city council shall approve and adopt a plan to restore the general fund's unassigned fund balance to its target level within a 24-month period. If, due to severe financial hardship of the city, the general fund's unassigned fund balance cannot be restored within this period, the city council shall establish a different time period.
(2)
Any general fund's unassigned fund balances which exceed the minimum level established by this policy may be appropriated by the city council for non-recurring capital projects, equipment or other operating uses.
(3)
The city council shall avoid the appropriation of general fund's unassigned fund balance for recurring operating or capital expenditures unless there is some extraordinary, non-recurring event which would require the appropriation in order to meet the needs of the citizenry or an emergency.
(h)
The city shall classify its enterprise funds' net assets as restricted, unrestricted or invested in capital assets. The city's unrestricted net assets of all of its enterprise funds should be sufficient to cover operating expenses and infrastructure replacements. Unrestricted net assets will be spent first, unless the expense was for a restricted asset.

ARTICLE VI. - PERSONNEL REGULATIONS

Sec. 2-212. - Probation period.
(a)
All employees placed in new full-time and part-time positions must serve a minimum six-month period of probation. All department heads must serve a minimum 12-month period of probation. This applies to new hires, rehires, promotions and transfers. The probation period shall conclude upon the assignment of a full-time position by the mayor, with the approval of the city council. Probationary periods may be extended beyond the minimum time periods set forth herein.
(b)
The probation period is designed to give the employee time to learn the position and to give the supervisor time to evaluate the employee's potential and performance. During the established probationary period, the city reserves the right to terminate the probationary employee's service with or without reasonable cause.
(c)
If an employee is unable to perform the work, the person must be terminated as early as possible. Early termination saves the city a time and dollar investment and saves the employee possible embarrassment and frustration. Rejected probationers shall be notified of such action in writing by the department head at any time during the probationary period and a copy of said notification shall be retained in the personnel files.
(d)
It is expected that informal evaluations will be conducted during the course of the probation period to assess performance and to advise employees of expectations regarding performance. Significant job deficiencies shall be documented in the employee's personnel file. These evaluations provide the necessary justification for retention of the person as a regular employee.
(e)
The probationary period may be extended, but in no event shall such period extend beyond 12 months for regular employees, or beyond 18 months for department heads. This is only after an evaluation of the situation, the employee's abilities, and demonstrated potential. Probation extension is done only upon recommendation of the supervisor or mayor and approved in writing by the city council.
(f)
If the employee successfully completes the probation period, he shall be informed in writing that he is now a regular employee. This will be accomplished by the mayor's office with the approval of the appropriate department head via the personnel action form. Until such written notification from the mayor, the probation period shall continue in effect even under such circumstances as the period extending beyond six months for regular employees or beyond 12 months for department heads.
(g)
When an employee first becomes a regular full-time employee, he becomes eligible for vacation and other appropriate leaves retroactive to the person's beginning date of employment, but will not be able to take vacation leave until after he has successfully completed the probationary period and promoted to regular employer status. In calculating the retroactive amount of leave, said leave shall be deemed to have commenced accruing in the first month in which such individual has worked at least 51 percent of the days of work in such month.
(h)
If an individual has been transferred or promoted, he remains eligible for all fringe benefits included with the previous position during the probation period for the transfer or promotion. If the position to which an employee has been transferred or promoted carries benefits different from those of the previous position, the person becomes eligible for the benefits of the new position upon the satisfactory completion of the probation period retroactive to the date of the transfer or promotion.
(i)
If an emergency arises during an employee's probationary period which requires a leave of absence, such time off, if granted, will not be considered as time worked.

(b)
Harassment defined.
(1)
The city prohibits any verbal, physical or visual conduct which could offend, intimidate or create a hostile working environment for any individual on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, disability or any other characteristics protected by federal, state or local law. The city also specifically prohibits sexual harassment, which is defined in this section as sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.
(2)
The conduct prohibited by subsection (b)(1) of this section will not be tolerated under any circumstances, including cases where the conduct is unwelcome, and/or:

Submission to the conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;
b.
Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the individual;
c.
The conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the individual's performance or of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
(3)
The types of behaviors that may constitute prohibited harassment include, but are not limited to: derogatory, vulgar, or graphic written or oral statements or jokes regarding race, color, religion, national origin, disability, gender, sexuality, sexual experience or any other characteristics protected by federal, state or local law; unnecessary touching or physical assault; sexual compliments, flirtations, advances, propositions, innuendoes, suggestions or jokes; or the display of offensive or sexually suggestive pictures or objects.

(c)
Responsibility. It shall be the joint responsibility of managers and supervisors to ensure adherence to this section.

(2)
If an employee believes that he has been harassed, he should immediately report the incident to the city clerk. If he is uncomfortable with reporting the harassment to this person or if he believes that his complaint was not properly addressed, or if the complaint pertains to the city clerk, the employee should report the incident to the mayor or the city attorney.
(3)
Any complaint will be thoroughly investigated in a professional manner. Employees will be notified of a decision or of the status of the investigation as soon as possible. There will be no discrimination or retaliation against any individual who files a good faith harassment complaint, even if the investigation produces insufficient evidence to support the complaint, and even if the charges cannot be proven.
(4)
There will also be no discrimination or retaliation against any other individual who participates in the investigation of a harassment complaint. If the investigation substantiates the complaint, appropriate corrective and/or disciplinary action (up to discharge) will be pursued. Actions taken internally to investigate and resolve harassment complaints will be conducted confidentially to the extent practicable and appropriate, and consistent with the Georgia Open Records Act, O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq., in order to protect the privacy of persons involved.
(e)
General provisions.
(1)
If a harassment complaint is directed against the city clerk or chief of police, the functions assigned to those persons by these procedures will be transferred to a superior as designated by the mayor.
(2)
Retaliatory action of any kind taken as a result of any individual or any employee seeking redress under these procedures is prohibited, and shall be regarded as a separate and distinct cause for complaint and discipline under these procedures.

Sec. 2-215. - Computer systems and electronic mail use policy.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
The purpose of this section is to establish standards for use of the intranet, extranet, local area networks, computers and associated peripherals, personal digital assistants (PDAs), data-enabled communications devices, and services accessed through Internet and electronic mail (referred to herein as the city computer systems) by city employees, volunteers, and elected officials who use city-provided resources, regardless of the user's location when accessing the network.
(2)
It is the intent of this section to:
a.
Ensure that the use of city-provided city computer systems are related to, or for the benefit of, city government.
b.
Inform users that documents created and received on the city computer systems are subject to the same laws, regulations, policies, and other requirements as information communicated in other written forms and formats.
c.
Minimize disruptions to city government activities from inappropriate use of city computer systems.
d.
Provide users with guidelines describing their personal responsibilities regarding confidentiality, privacy, records retention, and acceptable use of city computer systems as defined by this section.
e.
Protect the city from liability related to personal uses of city resources.
(3)
While the city makes every effort to redact information protected under the Georgia Open Records Act, the city assumes no liability for ensuring the privacy of personal, financial, or medical information an employee has voluntarily entered into the city's computer system utilizing e-mail or online services.
(b)
Policy.
(1)
As with any city resource, the use of city computer systems should be used primarily for legitimate city business and is governed by rules of conduct similar to those applicable to the use of other information technology (e.g., telephone, fax, etc.) resources, including the Open Meetings/Records Act of Georgia.
(2)
E-mail created or received by an employee or official in connection with official city business, which perpetuates, communicates or formalizes knowledge, is subject to the Georgia Open Records Act and open for inspection. E-mail created or received by an employee that is not in connection with official city business is still subject to the Georgia Open Records Act if the e-mail was created or received with city-provided resources and is retained in the system.
(3)
Employees and city officials will not use the city computer systems in any manner that would constitute a quorum of any official public body to conduct official city business. No employee or city official shall communicate via the city computer systems with a quorum of any official public body to specifically request a reply for anything other than transitional information. This does not affect the communication between any two members of any official public body via the Internet and this does not affect the ability of employees or city officials from sending information to a quorum of any official public body. All documents and communications created on the city computer systems shall be retained in accordance with the city's records retention policy.
(4)
When e-mail is used to send enduring messages, the message shall be retained in the e-mail archival system in accordance with the city's records retention policy. For the purposes of this CAR, any e-mail sent or received by any elected official shall be kept electronically in accordance with the Georgia Open Records Act. E-mail messages from elected officials to city staff that would otherwise be considered enduring messages shall be printed by city staff.
(5)
Employees shall not use the city computer systems to disseminate or print copyrighted materials (including articles and software) in violation of copyright laws and license agreements. Employees shall not use an Internet, electronic mail or online service account or signature line other than their own unless management provides expressed written permission for a specific purpose.
(6)
Employees shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent the inadvertent dissemination of anyone else's information via the Internet, electronic mail or online services.
(7)
City computer systems usage is subject to limitations as imposed by management to prevent excessive or improper use. The city strongly discourages the occasional use of city computer systems for non-business-related purposes. As with other communication devices available in modern offices, a small amount of personal use of computer usage may be allowed by management. This personal use of city computer systems will not interfere with work duties and will not be excessive as per management's discretion. Personal online transactions, including, but not limited to, paying personal bills, checking online financial services, purchasing goods and services for personal needs online by city employees or elected officials should not be considered secure on the city computer systems due to monitoring, and are discouraged. Utilizing social networking sites (e.g., myspace.com, facebook.com, match.com, personal dating sites, etc.) for non-work-related purposes by city employees or elected officials is not permitted on the city computer systems.
(8)
All software loaded and messages distributed via the city computer systems, unless otherwise restricted, are the city's property. It is not permitted for city employees or city officials to load or otherwise install software unless written permission has been given by the city.
(9)
Use of the city computer systems is a privilege, which imposes certain responsibilities and obligations on its users and is subject to city policies and local, state, and federal laws. Acceptable use must be legal, ethical, reflect honesty, and show restraint in the consumption of shared resources.
(10)
Use of city computer systems in a manner that could reasonably be construed as sexually explicit, scandalous, defamatory, libelous, immoral, offensive or discriminatory based on race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability or religious beliefs is not permitted.
(11)
Abuse of city computer systems privileges may be considered misuse of government property.
(c)
Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Electronic mail or e-mail means a method of sending messages between computers using a computer network or over a modem connected to a telecommunications line. E-mail is intended to expedite communications, reduce paperwork and automate routine office tasks, thereby increasing productivity and reducing costs. E-mail consists primarily of messages, but may also include attachments, such as calendars, directories, distribution lists, word processing documents, spreadsheets and other electronic documents. E-mail is stored in a digital format rather than on paper and is retrievable at a future date. Due to format, e-mail permits instant communication and transmittal of up-to-date information similar to the telephone, and unlike current telephone features, e-mail creates a record of the information that is being transmitted.
Employees means and includes all personnel paid by the city, regular and contracted, full-time and part-time. This policy also applies to any agents, contractors, or appointed officials of the city performing work on the city computer systems in the course of city business.
Management, in the context of this CAR, means the city manager and the city, working in concert to respond to issues of appropriateness of content as well as technical ramifications of the city computer systems.
Volunteers means and includes members of the general public who use city computer systems assisting a city department in the function of city business. Examples of volunteers include volunteer firefighters, members of the police auxiliary, library volunteers, interns, members of boards and commissions directly supported by a city department. This section is not applicable to library patrons or citizens using the publicly-advertised wireless access points in the city as they are subject to other requirements.
(d)
Public records and disclosure.
(1)
A message sent or received by the city computer systems in the conduct of public business with city- provided resources is subject to the Georgia Open Records Act and is considered a public record. Transitory e-mails may be deleted in accordance with the city's records retention schedule. E-mails stored and accessible are still public records and must be produced upon request.
(2)
The city clerk will coordinate with the city for the gathering of the public record city computer systems documents in response to an open records request following all applicable state laws.
(e)
No presumption of privacy.
(1)
Employees should keep in mind that city computer systems usage is not private. Electronically transmitted information travels through many networks and many different computer connections. Information sent across the Internet or through external networks has the potential to be viewed by parties not intended. All information that is created, stored and/or transmitted via the city's computer systems can be reviewed by management at any time. Since e-mail messages may be retained at different locations or levels of the system, users must remember that their communication can be retrieved during formal discovery processes. Discretion, therefore, is an important consideration when using this or any other new technology to send, record, retain or review information.
(2)
Officials and employees are advised of the risk involved in using e-mail to deal with confidential issues, and must be aware of all applicable statutory or regulatory requirements that would prohibit the disclosure of certain information in any format. Of special concern is the confidentiality of individual health and personnel information.
(3)
Abuse of the city computer systems may be considered misuse of government property.
(f)
Monitoring of city computer systems. The city utilizes software to monitor the activities of all computers used by employees, volunteers, and elected officials in the city. The city will provide information and data from any computer activity reports generated in accordance with all open records requests and as management requests. Additionally, the city will perform regular, random searches of computer activity data and report results to the city manager to ensure compliance with these regulations by all users of the city computer networks. It is vitally important for all users of the city's computer networks to ensure that activities on city computers are for legitimate city business. Use of city computer systems by employees, volunteers, or elected officials for reasons other than as outlined in this section is prohibited unless written authorization is made by the city, the requestor's director/supervisor and the city clerk or mayor.
(g)
Risks. Although the city computer systems can provide a significant business benefit for city departments, it is important to point out that use of the Internet and external networks exposes the city and users to related risks. The Internet is not one administrative entity, but rather is an interlocking network of systems from educational institutions, government agencies, and various commercial and nonprofit organizations. It is a shared information utility for individuals, business and governments. Even with the extensive effort to minimize risks, there is no known way to protect the city from all related risks. There are significant legal, security, and productivity issues associated with how the Internet is used. Examples of such issues are the potential:
(1)
To receive computer viruses and malicious code and programming from the downloading and use of programs and/or files from Internet sources;
(2)
For someone to eavesdrop on transmissions, which might include passwords, sensitive data or correspondence;
(3)
For users to be induced by the vast social and informational forums of the Internet into spending significant work time on non-city business-related activities;
(4)
To consume limited disk storage on city servers and on user PCs with information which has been downloaded from the Internet; and
(5)
For breaches of data security, confidentiality and intellectual property rights from unwanted intrusion into the agency network by hackers.
(h)
Responsibilities. Because of the various security, legal, and productivity issues referenced in this section, each user has the following responsibilities:
(1)
By participating in the use of networks and systems provided by the city, users agree to comply with policies governing their usage.
(2)
The content of any electronic correspondence exchanged (sent and/or received) via the city computer systems must be appropriate and consistent with city policy, subject to the same restrictions as any other correspondence.
(3)
E-mail is city correspondence and should be treated as such. The electronic format is irrelevant, and e-mail correspondence should be preserved based upon the subject matter in accordance with the city's records retention policy.
(4)
E-mail communications and attachments, if allowed to accumulate on a server, can quickly consume the server's disk space and may cause system problems. The deleted items folder should be regularly emptied of non-business messages. Users should not store messages in the deleted items folder.
a.
E-mail messages relating to city business should be treated as general correspondence (unless it meets another definition per the state retention schedule) and archived and retained electronically in accordance with the city's records retention policy utilizing the procedures established by the information technology department.
b.
Internal e-mail (sent between employees using the city's e-mail system) can result in duplicate copies on the system, and the sender shall be the primary retainer; recipients may retain e-mails relating to policy and assignments as needed for reference.
c.
External e-mail received from outside agencies or members of the public should be retained by the recipient.
d.
Messages of a non-city business-related nature, including, but not limited to, chain letters, forwarded jokes and stories, should be removed immediately after the user receives and reviews the message, and the recipient of that message should inform the sender of the city's policies regarding city computer systems use and advise that non-city business-related messages should not be sent in the future.
e.
Examples.
1.
Widely broadcast meeting agendas, minutes, reminders, etc. The recipient retains for useful life (probably once the meeting is over, or has been added to the calendar); the sender retains per the retention schedule.
2.
Assignments or requests from a supervisor. The recipient retains for useful life; the supervisor retains per the retention schedule.
3.
Citizen request for information or service. The recipient retains per the retention schedule.
4.
Employee response to citizen request. The sender retains per the retention schedule.
5.
Employee e-mails a state agency about a requirement. The sender retains per the retention schedule.
6.
State agency responds to employee request for information. The recipient retains per the retention schedule.
(5)
Comply with city policies, procedures, and standards.
(6)
Be courteous and protect others' privacy and confidentiality.
(7)
Be responsible for the protection and use of the logins, accounts and computer hardware and software allocated to them.
(8)
Use information technology resources efficiently and productively.
(i)
Acceptable use of city computer systems. Acceptable city computer systems activities are those that generally do not impede the purpose, goals, and mission of the city and each user's job duties and responsibilities. The following list includes, but is not limited to, examples of acceptable uses:
(1)
Communications, including information exchange, for professional development or to maintain job knowledge or skills;

(6)
Any personal use of city computer resources while on or off duty shall be kept to a minimum, as determined by management;
(7)
All users must ensure compliance with all other provisions of this CAR, especially subsection (j) of this section.
(j)
Unacceptable use of city computer systems.
(1)
Unacceptable use can be defined generally as activities that generally impede the purpose, goals and mission of the city and each user's job duties and responsibilities. Any city computer systems usage in which acceptable use is questionable should be avoided. When in doubt, an employee should seek policy clarification from his supervisor prior to pursuing the activity.
(2)
The following list, although not all-inclusive, provides some examples of unacceptable uses:
a.
Non-city business activities. This includes Internet use for private purposes, such as marketing or business transactions and private advertising of products or services.
b.
Use for, or in support of, unlawful/prohibited activities as defined by federal, state, and local laws or regulations. Illegal activities relating to Internet and network access include, but are not limited to:
1.
Tampering with or installing computer hardware or software;
2.
Willful vandalism or destruction of computer files;
3.
Transmission or generation of threatening, obscene, offensive or harassing materials;
4.
Attempts to access a remote site/computer without proper authorization;
5.
Use of the Internet to try to access data that is protected and not intended for public access;
6.
Violation of federal and state laws dealing with copyrighted materials or materials protected by a trade secret;
7.
Accessing or modifying contents of files, other data, or passwords of other users, unless explicitly authorized to do so by those users or management;
8.
Attempts to subvert network security, to impair functionality of the network, or to bypass restrictions set by the network administrators. Assisting others in violating these rules by sharing information or passwords is also unacceptable behavior;
9.
Deliberate interference or disruption of another user's work or system. The user must avoid any actions that cause interference to the network or cause interference with the work of others on the network. Users are prohibited from performing any activity that will cause the loss or corruption of data, the abnormal use of computing resources (degradation of system/network performance), or the introduction of computer viruses by any means (use of programs with the potential of damaging or destroying programs and data). To that end, any software downloaded from the Internet, with the exception of a list of approved software downloads maintained by the information technology department and published on the city's intranet, must be approved in writing by both the city and the division director/chief prior to download. Employees and officials are not permitted to load personal software on the city computer systems;
10.
Use of fee-for-service providers on the Internet, unless the necessary approvals and funding have been obtained in advance. Any individual who obligates the city to pay for services without prior approval is personally liable for these costs;
11.
Solicitation for religious and political causes;
12.
Use to gain access to any other Internet or external network service which requires membership if the user does not have proper membership, rights, and privileges in the other service;
13.
Accessing sites or information that could be interpreted as demonstrating poor ethical conduct, unless required as part of their official city duties (i.e., administrative or official investigations). These types of sites or information include, but are not limited to, those containing derogatory racial content, sexual content, derogatory religious content, offensive language, improper humor, material that could negatively reflect upon the city, or material prohibited by law.
(k)
Written acknowledgement required. Users having access to the city computer systems are advised that all such activity is the property of the city, and, therefore, they should not consider any activity to be private. By use of the city computer systems, all users acknowledge acceptance of and intention to comply with this section. To that end, all employees, volunteers, and elected officials will acknowledge their understanding of this section at the start of their employment with the city, with any substantive change to these regulations, or as otherwise needed to demonstrate acknowledgement of the policies. Copies of this section should be posted on all employee bulletin boards as well as distributed to all employees and officials by the division director/supervisor. Failure to acknowledge and follow this section may subject employees and officials to appropriate disciplinary action.
