ARTICLE 13. - SIGNS

Sec. 13.1. - Purposes.
The purposes of these sign regulations are: to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety; to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions. This sign ordinance is adopted under the zoning authority of the city in furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in the zoning ordinance.
(Ord. No. 2001-07, ยง 13.1, 4-10-2001)
Sec. 13.2. - Applicability; effect.
A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained in the city only in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this appendix. The effect of this appendix, as more specifically set forth herein, is:
1.
To establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial and industrial zones, and a limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this appendix;
2.
To allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive, and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this appendix, but without a requirement for permits;
3.
To provide for temporary signs without commercial messages in limited circumstances in the public right-of-way;
4.
To regulate signs so as to prevent the degradation of the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of tourism, visitation, and permanent economic growth;
5.
To prevent the proliferation of signs which may result in roadside clutter that would impede the flow of information from businesses to consumers thereby harming the economic health of the community, and that would impede the flow of information from traffic signs and signal and therefore create hazards to drivers and pedestrians;
6.
To lessen hazardous conditions, confusion and visual clutter caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs that compete for the attention of pedestrians and vehicular traffic, and impede vision of traffic, traffic control signs and devices;
7.
To prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this appendix; and
8.
To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this appendix.

(Ord. No. 2001-07, ยง 13.3, 4-10-2001)
Sec. 13.4. - Computations.
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height:
1.
Computation of area.
(a)
Freestanding signs. The area of a freestanding sign shall mean and shall be computed as the entire area within a continuous perimeter enclosing the limits of writing, representation, emblem, or any figure or similar character, with any frame, other material, open space, or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate such signs from the background upon which it is placed. The supports or structure upon which a freestanding sign is supported shall not be included in determining the sign area unless such supports are designed in such a manner as to form an integral part of the display; provided, however, that the surface area of the frame that is parallel to the display of the sign is no greater than 20 percent of the area of the sign displayed; and provided that the freestanding sign is no higher than six feet.
(b)
Monument signs. The area of a monument sign shall mean and shall be computed as the entire area within a continuous perimeter enclosing the limits of writing, representation, emblem, or any figure or similar character, with any frame, other material, open space, or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate such signs from the background upon which it is placed. The supports or structure upon which a monument sign shall be included in determining the sign area whenever such supports are designed in such a manner as to form an integral part of the display; provided, however, that the area of the frame shall not be included in computing the area of the sign when the frame is composed of stone or brick; and provided the frame contains or has attached no copy, words, writing, letters, or advertisement, although one trademark, insignia, coat of arms, or other similar identifying mark may be affixed to the frame, but may not be internally illuminated; and provided that the surface area of the frame that is parallel to the display of the sign is no greater than 100 percent of the area of the sign displayed; and provided that the monument sign is no higher than six feet.
(c)
Other signs. The area of a sign other than a freestanding or monument sign shall mean and shall be computed as the entire area within a continuous perimeter enclosing the limits of writing, representation, emblem, or any figure or similar character, with any frame, other material, open space, or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate such signs from the background upon which it is placed. The supports or structure upon which any sign other than a freestanding or monument sign is supported shall be included in determining the sign area whenever such supports are designed in such a manner as to form an integral part of the display; provided, however, that the area of the frame shall not be included in computing the area of the sign when the frame is composed of stone or brick; and provided the frame contains or has attached no copy, words, writing, letters, or advertisement, although one trademark, insignia, coat of arms, or other similar identifying mark may be affixed to the frame, but may not be internally illuminated; and provided that the surface area of the frame that is parallel to the display of the sign is no greater than 100 percent of the area of the sign displayed.
2.
Computation of area of multifaced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back-to-back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 24 inches apart from any point of the sign and the angle of separation does not exceed ten degrees, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
3.
Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zoned lot, whichever is lower.
4.
Computation of maximum total permitted sign area for a zoned lot. The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a zoned lot shall be computed by applying the standards contained in section 13.18 for the zoning district in which the lot is located. Lots fronting on two or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage, but signage cannot be accumulated and used on one street in excess of that allowed for lots with only one street frontage.

If the letter "S" appears for a sign type in a column, such sign is allowed only with prior permit approval in the zoning districts represented by that column. Special conditions may apply in some cases.
