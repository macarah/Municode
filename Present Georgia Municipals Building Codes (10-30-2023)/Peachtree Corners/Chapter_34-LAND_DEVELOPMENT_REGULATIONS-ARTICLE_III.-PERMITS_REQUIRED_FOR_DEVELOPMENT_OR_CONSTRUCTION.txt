ARTICLE III. - PERMITS REQUIRED FOR DEVELOPMENT OR CONSTRUCTION

Sec. 34-57. - Authorization required for land disturbance or development activities.
(a)
Permit required; exemptions. No disturbance of the land, including clearing, grubbing, or grading activities, shall commence or proceed except in accordance with the provisions of these development regulations, unless the activity is exempt as an agricultural activity in the RA-200 zoning district, or is for the construction of an individual single-family detached or duplex residence on a buildable lot of record.
(b)
Plan review and approval. Any developer of land within incorporated Peachtree Corners shall first submit to the department such plans, plats, or construction drawings as may be required by these regulations and shall have been granted a permit consistent with these regulations and approved by the department prior to the initiation of development activities. Approval of plans by the city officials or employees shall not imply nor transfer acceptance of responsibility for the application of the principles of engineering, architecture, landscape architecture, or any other profession, from the professional corporation or individual under whose hand or supervision the plans were prepared and sealed. Article IX of this chapter details the elements of the required plans.
(c)
Chattahoochee River Corridor certificate. If any portion of a property included within a proposed project is located within 2,000 feet of the bank of the Chattahoochee River, the project shall first obtain a certificate authorizing the development under the provisions of the Metropolitan River Protection Act before any clearing, grading, or construction activity may be granted a permit by the department or any other agency. All permits issued by the city pursuant to such authorization shall be consistent with the requirements and provisions of the certificate. Any violation of the provisions of the Metropolitan River Protection Act Certificate shall be considered as though a violation of these development regulations, and shall be subject to the enforcement and penalty provisions hereunder.
(d)
Interdepartmental review and approval. The department shall not issue a permit for any development activities until the plans, plats, or construction drawings, as applicable, have been approved by such other departments or agencies as may have authority or jurisdiction over said activities in whole or in part.
(e)
Activities limited to permit authorization. Development activities shall be limited to those as authorized by the applicable permit and as may be further restricted by conditions of approval pertaining thereto attached by the department or other department or agency as may have authority or jurisdiction over said activities in whole or in part.
(f)
Developer's responsibility for compliance. No permit shall be interpreted to relieve any developer or subdivider of the responsibility of maintaining full compliance with all codes, ordinances, and other regulations of the city except as amended by an approved waiver, variance, or other relief granted through applicable formal appeal procedures for a specific property or application. Any permit issued in error or in contradiction to the provisions of an adopted code, ordinance, or regulation of the city shall be considered to have been null and void upon its issuance.

Sec. 34-58. - Land disturbance permits.
(a)
Clearing permit, clearing and grubbing permit, and grading permit. The following permits covering portions of the land development process may be issued in accordance with the requirements of these regulations and the provisions of any Metropolitan River Protection Act Certificate, if applicable:
(1)
Clearing permit.
a.
A permit limited to clearing only with no grubbing or other land disturbance except for such activities necessary to install and maintain erosion and sediment control practices (as defined in the Georgia Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Act) may be issued upon identification of the property, the limits of the area to be cleared and the type of activities to be undertaken, an erosion and sediment control plan unless exempt under the soil erosion and sediment control ordinance, a hydrology study if an erosion and sediment control is required, and approval of a tree preservation/replacement plan as may be required under the buffer, landscape, and tree ordinance. All clearing activities are to be consistent with the provisions of these regulations, the soil erosion and sediment control ordinance, the zoning resolution and any conditions of zoning approval.
b.
A clearing permit shall expire unless activities are commenced within 60 consecutive calendar days of issuance of the permit or if activities lapse and are abandoned for a period exceeding 30 consecutive calendar days.
c.
A clearing permit shall not be construed as approval of or authorization to construct any improvements, buildings, or other structures on the property.
(2)
Clearing and grubbing permit.
a.
A clearing and grubbing permit may be approved based on approval of a concept plan and tree preservation and/or replacement plan (if required) for the development, Erosion and sediment control plan, and hydrology study. Appropriate soil erosion and sedimentation controls and tree protection measures shall be placed and maintained as required.
b.
A permit for clearing and grubbing shall expire unless activities are commenced within 60 consecutive calendar days of issuance of the permit or if activities lapse and the project is abandoned for a period exceeding 30 consecutive calendar days.
c.
A clearing and grubbing permit shall be limited to the removal of vegetation and stumps and the placement of required tree protection measures and soil erosion and sedimentation facilities, and may authorize the removal of existing structures on the property at the option of the developer. No grading or construction activities may be started under a clearing and grubbing permit except for such activities necessary to install and maintain erosion and sediment control practices. The approval of a clearing and grubbing permit shall not imply the approval of or authorization to construct any improvements, buildings, or other structures on the property.
(3)
Grading permit.
a.
A grading permit, which may include clearing and grubbing, may be issued prior to approval of a development permit, as provided under article IX of this chapter. A grading permit may also be issued for earth borrow or storage, where no development or construction is proposed or imminent, based on approval of a grading plan, soil erosion and sediment control plan, and hydrology study, consistent with the requirements of the buffer, landscape, and tree ordinance, the zoning category of the site, and the provisions of the comprehensive plan (as applicable).
b.
A permit authorizing, but not limited to, grading (and clearing and grubbing) shall expire unless activities are commenced within 60 consecutive calendar days of issuance of the permit or if activities lapse and the project is abandoned for a period exceeding 30 consecutive calendar days. Any site for which the grading permit expires shall immediately be stabilized to prevent erosion.
c.
A grading permit shall be limited in its authorization to land grading activities along with associated tree protection, clearing and grubbing, and demolition activities, and may authorize the construction of storm drainage improvements and soil erosion and sedimentation facilities as allowed by the permit itself.
(b)
Development permit.
(1)
Development activities authorized. A development permit shall be issued to authorize all activities associated with the land development process, including clearing and grubbing, grading, and the construction of such improvements as streets, surface parking areas and drives, sewer systems, stormwater drainage facilities, sidewalks, or other structures permanently placed on or in the property except for buildings or other structures requiring the issuance of a building permit. Water system improvements shall be authorized solely by the public utilities department.
(2)
Development permit approval. A development permit (which may include grading, clearing, and grubbing) shall be issued at the developer's request following approval of a Metropolitan River Protection Act Certificate, if applicable, and upon approval of a preliminary plat for a subdivision or a site plan for a non-subdivision project, along with approval of all other development plans and documents required to be submitted under article IV of this chapter. All plans approved for a development permit shall expire after six months if no permit is issued within said time period.
(3)
Expiration of development permits. A development permit shall expire 12 consecutive calendar months after issuance unless development activity as authorized by the permit is initiated within the 12-month period or if such authorized activities lapse and the project is abandoned for a period exceeding 60 consecutive calendar days. The director may approve one extension not exceeding three consecutive calendar months within which time development activity must commence or the permit shall expire. Said extension shall be applied for within the first 12 consecutive calendar months after the permit's issuance.
(4)
Lapse in construction activity. For the purposes of these regulations, a lapse in or suspension of development activity as authorized by a development permit, as a direct result of action or inaction on the part of the city completely beyond the control of the developer, shall not be considered as a lapse in activity causing the development permit to expire. The 12 months within which development activity must begin shall exclude any such time period during which the activity is prohibited or has been caused to lapse by said city action or inaction.
