Such appeal shall be by written petition, filed in the office of the city within 15 days after the final order or action of the city manager or the county chief of police and, in order to defray administrative costs, must be accompanied by a filing fee of $50.00. The city mayor and council or the county chief of police, at their discretion, may waive or reduce the filing fee amount if it is determined the fee would create a hardship on the business filing such appeal.

A hearing shall be conducted on each appeal within 30 days of the date of filing with the city or the county chief of police or his designee unless a continuance of such date is agreed to by the appellant and the city manager or his designee or the county chief of police or his designee. The appellant at such hearing shall have the right to be represented by an attorney, at the expense of the appellant, and to present evidence and cross examine witnesses. Should the applicant desire an official transcript of the appeal proceedings, then such request must be made at least three days prior to such hearing. The appellant shall have the burden of proof on any such appeal. Before hearing an appeal, the city mayor and council shall sign an affidavit to be part of the record that they are not related to or personal friends with any owner of the establishment in question in the appeal. Should any member be unable to sign such an affidavit, that member of city council shall not serve on that appeal and the case shall be heard by the other members of city council.
(3)
The findings of the city mayor and council shall be forwarded to the county chief of police within 15 days after the conclusion of the hearing, and it shall be the duty of the county chief of police or his designee to notify the appellant of the action of the city mayor and council.

Unsupported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole; or
