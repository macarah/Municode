--- (5) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2019-12-158, adopted December 17, 2019, added provisions intended for use as §§ 18-214—18-224. To allow room for future expansion, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as §§ 18-230—18-240.

Sec. 18-230. - Description.
Litter found throughout our community often finds its way into our streams, rivers and lakes and detracts from our quality of life. Pollutants carried into our streams, rivers, and lakes by litter, diminish the quality of our water and its aquatic resources. Litter control ordinances provide a prohibition against littering and provide an enforcement mechanism with penalties for dealing with those found littering.
This article is modeled on the "Georgia Litter Control Law" (O.C.G.A. § 16-7-40 et seq.) and adoption of this article is authorized by O.C.G.A. § 16-7-48.
