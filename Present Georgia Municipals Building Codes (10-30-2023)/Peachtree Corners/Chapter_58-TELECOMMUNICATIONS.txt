Sec. 58-32. - Inventory of existing sites.
(a)
The county department of planning and development shall maintain an inventory of all towers or alternative tower structures, active and inactive, which are present in the city. This inventory shall include specific information about the location (latitude and longitude coordinates), height, design, tower type and general suitability for antenna co-location of each tower, and other pertinent information as may be decided by the department.
(b)
To facilitate the co-location of antennas, each applicant seeking to locate a new tower, alternative tower structure or antenna, or modify any such existing structure, shall provide to the department an affidavit setting forth an inventory of its existing towers or alternative tower structures as provided for below. The applicant shall specifically identify its towers or alternative structures, active or inactive, which are present in the city. Applicants seeking to erect an amateur radio tower or antenna shall be exempt from this provision.
(c)
The applicant's affidavit shall include all of its structures that are within the jurisdiction, in whole or in part, of the city, or within one mile of the border of the city, and shall include specific information about the location (latitude and longitude coordinates), height, design, tower type and general suitability for antenna co-location of each tower, and other pertinent information as may be required by the department. The department may share such information with other applicants for a tall structure permit under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate towers or antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that the department shall not, by sharing such information, in any way be deemed to have represented or warranted that such sites are available or suitable.
(d)
An application for a tall structure permit shall not be considered complete without this affidavit of inventory.
(Ord. of 7-1-2012, § 108-52)
Sec. 58-33. - Co-location; design requirements.
In addition to all applicable building and safety codes, all towers, except amateur radio towers, shall be designed to accommodate the co-location of cellular telecommunication antennas according to the following:
(1)
For towers up to 125 feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least two providers; and

(Ord. of 7-1-2012, § 108-53)
Sec. 58-34. - Co-location; availability of suitable existing structures.
(a)
No new tower, except amateur radio towers, shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department and the mayor, city council or a designee thereof that no existing tower or existing alternative tower structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts and shall consist of more than mere conclusory statements that no existing tower is suitable. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of one or more of the following:
(1)
That no existing towers or suitable alternative tower structures are located within the geographic antenna placement area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
(2)
That existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's antenna and related equipment.
(3)
That the applicant's proposed antennas would cause electromagnetic interference with the antennas on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
(4)
That the cost or contractual provisions required by the tower owner to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable.
(5)
That the applicant adequately demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
(b)
For each of the above, the applicant must submit an affidavit listing the existing towers which were considered, and ultimately rejected, by the applicant and provide a detailed explanation of why the existing towers are not usable.
