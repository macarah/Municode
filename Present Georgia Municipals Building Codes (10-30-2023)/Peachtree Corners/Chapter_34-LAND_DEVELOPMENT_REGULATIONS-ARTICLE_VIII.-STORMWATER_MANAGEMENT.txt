Availability of feasible locations for detention facilities;
(8)
Existing flows generated off-site which pass through the project site; and
(9)
The nature of the receiving watercourse.
(Ord. No. 2020-10-181, 11-17-2020)
Sec. 34-194. - Design and construction guidelines.
(a)
Detention design criteria, general.
(1)
Stormwater detention facilities shall be constructed in accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the department and shall be in place and inspected prior to the initiation of other improvements. If the detention facility is planned to be a lake, temporary detention facilities shall be provided and shall remain in place until such time as the lake has become effective in providing stormwater management. The construction shall be in accordance with the GSMM and chapter 18, article VI of this Code.
(2)
All stormwater detention facilities shall be designed to detain the one-year storm runoff, for the area draining to the pond, for 24 hours. For the project, this volume called the channel protection volume shall be equal to or greater than the one-year storm runoff volume from the project. In addition, these facilities shall control the peak flow rates associated with storms having one-year, two-year, five-year, ten-year, 25-year, and 50-year return frequencies so that flows from the developed site do not exceed those associated with pre-development conditions at the project boundary nor increase the peak flows downstream from the project to the point in the drainage basin where the project area is ten percent of the total basin.
(3)
Where adverse impacts occur during the 100-year storm, the 100-year storm shall also be regulated. The hydrologic methodology used for any given project shall conform to the Georgia Stormwater Management (GSMM) and chapter 18, article VI of this Code. Runoff coefficients and runoff curve numbers used for pre- and post-development conditions shall be consistent with those shown in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.
(4)
The USGS Method shall be used, where applicable, to check the magnitude of peak flows when other hydrologic methods recommended in the manual are used.
(5)
Calculations shall be provided showing how all times of concentration or lag times were computed, both for pre- and post-developed conditions. Likewise, adequate support must be provided for all composite runoff coefficients or curve numbers used.
(b)
Best management practice location criteria.
(1)
A detention facility consists of the area within the maximum design ponding limits, the dam (if one), embankment slopes and wall footings (if applicable), primary and emergency outlet works, any drainage/access easements, and any energy dissipation devices. The extent of the facility is defined to allow flooding, access and maintenance.
(2)
Detention facilities, to the greatest extent feasible, shall be located so as to minimize the amount of flow generated on the project site that bypasses the facility.
(3)
No portion of any detention facility shall disturb any required (as opposed to voluntary) buffer, landscape strip, or tree protection area, except that natural bottom detention ponds and its appurtenant structures, which require no grading and removal of trees, may encroach into a required construction buffer.
(4)
The 100-year ponding limits of a detention facility shall not encroach upon a public right-of-way.
(5)
Detention facilities may be located within utility easements or rights-of-way, or encroach upon utility easements or rights-of-way, upon receipt by the department of written permission from both the property and utility owners.
(6)
Detention facilities may be constructed within recreation areas required under section 34-85, if the following criteria are met:
a.
Ownership of the area will be held by a qualified property owner's association, homeowner's association, or other private parties.
b.
Permanent structures, such as buildings and swimming pools, will not be constructed within the boundaries of the detention facility.
c.
Detention facilities within recreation areas will be approved only if the design of the area includes recreation amenities, such as ball fields, tennis courts, grassed open areas or other similar improvements. The intent is to provide recreation facilities with detention as a secondary feature.
d.
Permanent detention features shall not interfere with the intended uses of the recreation amenity (i.e. a ditch or large swale shall not traverse a ball field, an inlet structure shall not be in a tennis court, etc.).
(7)
If a residential subdivision is provided with an on-site detention facility not located within a recreation area, a mandatory property owner's association shall be established for its ownership and maintenance. The facility shall be located on a single lot within the development and owned by the property owner's association. The lot shall have a minimum of 30 feet of public road frontage and a minimum lot width of 30 feet. Access to the facility shall be located on this lot. If the project is provided with an off-site detention facility, a mandatory property owner's association shall be established for its maintenance. The association bylaws shall be recorded concurrently with the recording of a final subdivision plat. The association bylaws shall include the same provisions as specified in subsection 34-85(b)(2).
(8)
A nonresidential subdivision is not required to locate an on-site detention facility on a separate lot. The property owners served by a detention facility that provides detention for more than one property owner or is located off site shall enter into a maintenance agreement acceptable to the city for the facility's maintenance. However, if desired by the developer, the facility may be located on a separate lot if it is owned and maintained by a mandatory property owner's association.
(9)
Parking lot detention facilities.
a.
Parking lot detention facilities shall generally be of one of the two following types:
1.
Depressed areas of pavement at drop inlet locations; and
2.
Ponding areas along sections of raised curbing. The curbing in these areas is usually higher than a standard curbed section.
b.
The detention methodology utilized for all parking lot detention facility design shall conform to the stormwater design manual.
c.
Parking lot detention areas shall be located so as to restrict ponding to areas other than parking spaces near buildings, and to not encroach upon entrance drives.
d.
The maximum depth of detention ponding in a parking lot, except at a flow control structure, shall be six inches for a ten-year storm, and nine inches for a 100-year storm. The maximum depth of ponding at a flow control structure shall be 12 inches for a 100-year storm.
e.
In truck parking areas, the maximum depth of ponding shall be 12 inches for the ten-year storm.
f.
Detention ponding areas are to be drained within 30 minutes after the peak inflow occurs.
g.
Parking lot detention areas shall have a minimum surface slope of one percent, and a maximum slope of five percent.
(10)
Underground and rooftop detention facilities. The design of underground or rooftop detention facilities shall be in accordance with current engineering standard practice, and shall conform to the general spirit and intent of this article. In the case of rooftop detention, permissible structural loads and weatherproofing shall be governed by the state building code as may be amended by the city.
(11)
Sediment basins.
a.
Stormwater management and sediment trapping functions should be separated whenever possible. Every erosion control design should seek to: first, prevent erosion from occurring; second, trap sediments as close to their sources as possible, and third, provide a second-tier or backup line of defense against sediments leaving the project site. This backup defense will usually consist of check dams/and or sediment basins.
b.
Whenever a sediment basin and a detention facility are both required on the same watercourse, the sediment basin should be located immediately upstream of the detention facility.
c.
In unusual cases where a normally dry detention basin is planned to be used to trap sediment as well as provide stormwater control, the basin may be undercut to accommodate the sediment so that the required detention characteristics, particularly volume, will be maintained.
d.
The design of sediment basins shall be in accordance with Appendix C of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia.
(12)
Ponds and lakes not used for detention. In such cases where a pond or lake is provided as part of a development, but is not planned to function as a stormwater detention facility, the same general and specific criteria contained in these regulations shall apply, but may be modified in instance where a specific requirement is clearly detention-oriented rather than safety-based.
(c)
Detention facility and water quality easement requirements.
(1)
In both nonresidential and residential subdivisions or projects, an easement at least 20 feet in width shall be required so as to provide access to all detention and water quality facilities from a public street.
(2)
Every normally dry detention basin, lake, water quality facility or parking lot detention facility shall be completely enclosed within a drainage easement. The drainage easement shall extend at least ten feet beyond the 100-year flooding limits of the detention facility.
(3)
Access easement.
a.
Access easements may be combined with drainage easements containing an open channel; however, the combined easement shall be a minimum of 30 feet in width and shall be wide enough for the drainage channel and the drive.
b.
A drive to the bottom of the pond shall be provided when the facility is over ten feet deep from the bench elevation or the facility is wider than 50 feet as measured from bench to bench.
c.
The access easement shall be cleared, grubbed and graded so that it can be utilized by rubber-tired construction vehicles.
d.
The minimum drive width shall be 15 feet.
e.
The drive shall be grassed or paved.
f.
The maximum slope shall be 20 percent (5H:1V).
(d)
Dam design and construction criteria.
(1)
Detention facilities which take the form of normally dry basins, ponds, or lakes usually are created by damming a drainage way or watercourse. Such dams can take a variety of different forms, the most common being earthen embankments and reinforced concrete walls. Each type of dam has different characteristics, and the selection of the most appropriate type for a particular site should be made by an authorized registered professional and based on the physical features of the dam site, the purpose of the dam, the type of impoundment, safety, and maintenance requirements.
(2)
For purposes of these regulations, dams will be addressed separately for each of the three most frequently encountered types of detention facilities: normally dry basins, ponds, and lakes. A normally dry basin is one designed to impound stormwater runoff for only a brief period of time following a storm event. The vast majority of the time the basin will be completely dry except for any normal stream flows which pass through unimpeded. Lakes and ponds, on the other hand, are designed to impound a body of water at least several feet in depth on a more-or-less permanent basis. Lakes and ponds vary from one another only in terms of magnitude. The magnitude of a lake is determined primarily from the height of its dam, the size of its contributing drainage area, and the volume of water it is capable of impounding. For purposes of these regulations, a pond is any lake having a dam height of less than nine feet and which is incapable of impounding more than 20 acre-feet of water.
(3)
All dam design shall be certified by a professional engineer currently registered in the state.
(4)
Dams for normally dry detention basins shall conform to the following:
a.
Dams for normally dry detention basins may be constructed of earth, reinforced concrete, mortared rubble, or other suitable materials.
b.
The design of any concrete or rubble wall over five feet in height shall be certified by a structural engineer currently registered as a professional engineer in the state, and the structural design shall be based on soil tests certified by a professional engineer.
c.
Any non-earthen structure shall be designed to prevent piping failure through its subgrade and abutments.
d.
The construction of walls over five feet in height shall be monitored and approved by a qualified materials testing company.
e.
Earthen dams for normally dry detention basins shall have a top width of no less than eight feet.
f.
For earthen dams for normally dry detention basins, there shall be at least 1.5 feet of vertical separation between the 100-year ponding elevation in the basin and the low point on the top of the dam. One foot of this distance is to provide a margin of safety against overtopping of the dam and the other six inches is to allow for settlement. Separation is not required for a non-earthen dam if it has been designed to overtop safely.
g.
More stringent design and construction criteria shall be used for dams for normally dry detention basins whenever the probable consequences of dam failure are severe.
(5)
Dams for normally dry ponds shall conform to the following: any professional engineer responsible for the design of a dam for a pond is expected to be knowledgeable of the criteria contained within the Georgia Safe Dams Act, state department of natural resources "Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60 "Earth Dams and Reservoirs." The provisions of each are to be applied wherever applicable. Applicability shall be determined based upon site-specific constraints and downstream conditions. Consultation with appropriate department personnel, both prior to and throughout the design process, is encouraged.
(6)
Dams for lakes shall conform to the following: any professional engineer responsible for the design of a dam for a lake is expected to be thoroughly familiar with the criteria contained within the Georgia Safe Dams Act, state department of natural resources "Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60 "Earth Dams and Reservoirs." All design is to be in accordance with the applicable requirements contained in each of the above referenced publications.
(e)
Detention facility outlet devices.
(1)
Because of the variables that may be associated with the choice of an outlet device for any given condition, the design consultant is responsible for the selection of the device, subject to the review and approval of the department.
(2)
The department will include in its consideration the ease of maintenance, longevity of the system, and freedom from congestion, practicality, and aesthetics in its review of the outlet device. The consultant should be guided by the departmental preference of vertical weir designs since they have proven to generally meet most of the considerations expressed herein.
(3)
An orifice smaller than 15 inches in diameter shall be protected by a trash rack. A trash rack protecting an orifice shall have surface area of at least ten square feet. Design shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual. No opening in the trash rack shall have an area more than one-half the size of the area of the orifice being protected. Two-stage trash racks or screens having progressively smaller openings placed in series, are suggested. To facilitate outlet operation, curved or inclined trash racks designed to allow debris to rise with the water level are preferred. In all cases, trash racks shall be either hinged or removable to facilitate maintenance operations.
(4)
If the primary detention facility outlet is a conduit through a dam, and there is not an orifice, weir-box, or other flow-control device affixed to the upstream end, then the conduit shall be analyzed for both inlet and outlet control conditions. If an orifice or weir-box is affixed, then the conduit shall be analyzed to determine if any flows will occur for which outlet control conditions in the conduit, rather than the hydraulic characteristics of the flow-control structure, will determine the total flows occurring. In any case where the conduit through the dam is less than 15 inches in diameter, the trash rack provisions of subsection (c)(3) of this section shall be followed.
(5)
Unless the 100-year maximum flow velocity in a conduit through a dam forming a pond or a lake is less than ten feet per second, and the hydraulic grade line for the 100-year condition is at or below the crown of the conduit for at least 90 percent of its length, the conduit must be equal or superior to Class V reinforced concrete pipe in its structural characteristics.
(f)
Emergency overflow requirements.
(1)
For every type of detention facility, a planned safe flow path must be provided for conveyance of flows of water in excess of those for which the detention facility was designed. In many instances, this function can be provided through installation of an emergency spillway. Emergency spillways are usually excavated open channels, either vegetated or paved with reinforced concrete.
(2)
Every earthen dam shall be provided with an open-channel emergency spillway, unless all of the following apply:
a.
The principal spillway is a closed conduit having a cross-sectional area that can pass 125 percent of the 100-year storm routed peak discharge.
b.
The principal spillway is a closed conduit having a cross-sectional area of at least one square foot per each three acres of drainage area, or a maximum of 20 square feet of surface area, whichever is less.
c.
The principal spillway capacity is at least equal to the capacity required for an open channel emergency spillway.
d.
The low point of the dam crest is not in a fill section except for roadway embankments.
e.
A trash rack or other debris protection is provided on the outlet control.
(3)
Any portion of any emergency spillway excavated into a dam embankment or other fill section must be paved. Pavement material shall be either reinforced concrete or asphalt, as dictated by the design life of the dam and the potential consequences of its failure. Any portion of any emergency spillway excavated into natural ground shall be vegetated in accordance with the practices described in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia.
(4)
In determining the necessary dimensions of an open-channel spillway for a normally dry basin, a pond, or a lake, the methodology contained in the Earth Emergency Spillway Design Data section of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia should be used.
(5)
Emergency spillway capacity for dams shall be as follows:
a.
For normally dry detention basins, ponds, and lakes, having a dam height of less than nine feet and which are incapable of impounding more than 20 acre-feet of water, and for which the probable sequences of dam failure are not severe, an emergency spillway should be provided. Its capacity should be at least equal to the routed 100-year peak flow out of the detention facility assuming the principal spillway is blocked.
b.
For normally dry detention basins, ponds, and lakes, having a dam height of nine feet or more and which are capable of impounding 20 acre-feet or more of water, an emergency spillway should be provided. Its capacity should be at least equal to the greater of either the routed 100-year peak flow rate out of the facility assuming the principal spillway is blocked, or the routed one-fourth PMF hydrograph out of the facility. In cases when state or federal regulations may require greater spillway capacity, those more stringent regulations shall govern.
(6)
Emergency overflow for non-earthen dams may take the form of planned structure overtopping. In such cases, however, care must be taken to prevent flows from eroding supporting soils along the toe of or immediately downstream from the dam so as the cause it to be undermined. The profile of the top of the dam shall be so designed as to prevent flows along the ends of the structure that might result in abutment erosion.
(g)
Culverts and pipe collection system guidelines.
(1)
Culverts.
a.
Single barrel or single cell culvert structures are less prone to clogging and require less maintenance than multi-barrel or multi-cell installations and should therefore be used whenever feasible.
b.
The maximum velocity in a corrugated metal culvert for the 100-year flow shall be 15 fps (feet per second). Velocities over ten fps in a pipe of any material shall be considered a special design with particular attention required to pipe or structure invert protection and to fill slope, stream bed, and stream bank stability.
c.
The minimum allowable slope shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual.
(2)
Pipe collection systems.
a.
The maximum velocity in a corrugated metal pipe system for the design flow shall be 15 fps. Velocities over ten fps in a pipe of any material shall be considered a special design with particular attention required to pipe invert protection and the ability of the receiving waterway or detention facility to accept the flow without damage.
b.
The minimum allowable slope shall be in accordance with the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.
c.
The maximum allowable slope for a concrete storm drainage pipe shall be ten percent, for a corrugated metal pipe shall be 14 percent, and for a HDPE pipe shall be 14 percent. Greater slopes may be approved if installation is in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. In cases where the slope is in excess often percent, anchor collars may be required.
d.
A minimum pipe cover of one foot shall be required.
(3)
Outlet location; culverts and pipe systems.
a.
Outlet structures, such as headwalls, shall not be located closer to the project site's property line with an adjoining property than the greater of the distance necessary to construct any velocity protection or a flow distance equal to six pipe diameters. For non-circular conduits, this distance shall be six times the rise dimension of the conduit.
b.
The invert elevation of a culvert or pipe outlet shall be no more than two feet above the elevation of the bottom of the receiving watercourse at the outlet.
(4)
Energy dissipation. The maximum developed condition flow velocity at the project site's downstream property line with an adjoining tract shall not exceed the maximum pre-developed condition velocity. Calculations may be required to support this velocity standard on a case-by-case basis.
(5)
Discharge of concentrated flows.
a.
The discharge of concentrated flows of stormwater into public roadways shall be avoided. In no case shall such concentrated flows, including flows from swales, ditches, draws, driveways, or piped systems, exceed the allowable peak flow rates in Table 9-G, below.
EXPAND
Table 9-G
Maximum Flows into Streets
Street
classification Allowable peak flow rate for a two-year storm
Local 2.0 cfs
Minor collector 1.0 cfs
Other 0.5 cfs
  b.
In residential subdivisions, the drainage area contributing to the peak flow along any property line between lots within 50 feet of the building setback line for either lot shall not exceed two acres, unless contained within a piped drainage system or maintained in a natural watercourse. The stormwater conveyance shall be in a drainage easement.

Sec. 34-195. - Project close-out.
(a)
Detention facility as-builts, engineer's certification, and record drawings.
(1)
When a new facility is constructed in a development, a certified record survey of each detention facility shall be prepared by an authorized registered professional currently registered in the state. A certified record drawing of the facility shall be prepared based upon this survey. Based on the actual parameters established on the record drawing, an addendum to the stormwater management report shall be prepared which demonstrates that the facility, as constructed, complies with the requirements of these regulations. The amended stormwater management report shall be certified by the authorized registered professional. The survey shall be performed after substantial completion and stabilization of the project has occurred. The record drawing and addendum to the stormwater management report shall be submitted to the city at least one week prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval (as appropriate to the project).
(2)
When a development uses an existing facility without an existing stormwater maintenance bond, the facility shall be cleaned out, if necessary, and a new record survey, drawing and certification showing that the outlet structure exists as approved and the flood storage and water quality volume of the facility is equal to or greater than the volume required when the facility was approved. As an alternative, a new record survey, drawing, study and certification showing that the facility meets the development requirements that were in effect when the facility was approved shall be submitted. The survey shall be performed after substantial completion and stabilization of the project has occurred. The certification and supporting data shall be submitted to the city at least one week prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy of final plat approval (as appropriate to the project).
(3)
Prior to or concurrent with the recording of a final plat for a subdivision, or issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a non-subdivision project, the developer shall provide acceptable surety, such as a bond or letter of credit, providing for the maintenance of the facility for a period of not less than 18 months. The amount of the surety shall be the greater of 50 percent of construction costs of the facility or 100 percent of the cost to clean out the facility. At the end of 18 months, the city may require the surety to be renewed due to anticipated maintenance caused by such concerns as future construction activity in the basin draining to the facility. A renewed surety may be required up to a total maximum of ten years. The surety for a facility shall be renewed during the ten years until:
a.
The surface water drainage area within the project has undergone final stabilization and all planned construction activity has been completed;
b.
All stormwater runoff in the surface water drainage area within the project is coming from undisturbed or stabilized areas;
c.
At least 90 percent of the lots in that surface water drainage area within the project have been sold to an unrelated party, permanent structures completed and final stabilization achieved;
d.
The accumulation of acreage of undeveloped lots, lots with no completed permanent structure and no final stabilization within the surface water drainage area within the project is less than five acres or ten percent of the total area of the common development draining to the facility, whichever is greater; and
e.
Within two months of surety release, the facility shall be cleaned out, if necessary, and a new record survey, drawing and certification showing that the volume of the facility is equal to or greater than the volume shown in the record survey, drawing and certification when the facility was approved. As an alternative, a new record survey, drawing and certification showing that the facility complies with these regulations as specified in Chapter 18, Article VI Post-Construction Stormwater Management for New Development and Redevelopment, shall be submitted.
(b)
Detention facility maintenance.
(1)
The detention storage capacity or function of any detention basin, pond or other impoundment, whether natural or manmade, shall not be removed or diminished without the express approval of the department.
(2)
In a residential subdivision, it shall be the responsibility of the mandatory property owner's association to maintain the operational characteristics of any facility constructed on their property for stormwater detention pursuant to city requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris.
(3)
In a nonresidential subdivision or project served by a detention facility that provides detention for more than one property or by an off-site facility, the property owners shall enter into a maintenance agreement with the city for maintenance of the operational characteristics of the facility pursuant to city requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris.
(4)
In a nonresidential project with an on-site detention facility which serves only that project, the property owner shall be responsible to maintain the operational characteristics of the facility pursuant to city requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris.
(5)
Where no maintenance agreement has been recorded, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain the operational characteristics of any facility constructed on their property for stormwater management pursuant to city requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris.
(6)
Prior to the issuance of a development permit, the owner shall submit a detailed schedule of long-term maintenance and inspection activities. This schedule of activities shall be incorporated into a maintenance agreement to be entered into between the city and the owner. The schedule shall describe all maintenance and inspection activities and the parties responsible. The maintenance agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the city and shall be recorded in the deed records of the clerk of superior court of the city.
