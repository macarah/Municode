Such dead-end streets shall be designed so as to allow their reasonable extension, and shall be located so as to be reasonably incorporated into a street design for the neighboring property. The stub street requirement may be waived by the director, provided the directors of the departments of public safety and public utilities concur.
(2)
Dead-end streets on abutting property shall be extended into a proposed subdivision and incorporated into the street design of the development. This requirement may be modified by the director in cases of serious topographical hardship or dissimilar zoning which would create unacceptable land use conflicts between the two developments. This modification may conflict between the two developments. This modification may be conditioned on the provision of easements necessary for the extension of public utilities, the provision of cul-de-sac or other permanent turnaround on the dead end street, or the removal of the dead end street back to its nearest intersection.
(3)
Where a dead-end street (other than a cul-de-sac) serves more than three lots, the developer shall be required to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround within the right-of-way. This requirement may be waived if extension of the dead end street is approved and under construction prior to its inclusion in a final plat.

(g)
Reserve strips. Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way which could control or are intended to control access to streets, alleys, or public lands shall not be permitted unless their control is given to the city under ownership, dedication, or easement conditions approved by the city attorney or acceptable to the director. No development shall be designed so as to deny access to abutting properties.
(h)
Alleys. Alleys shall not be provided except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the director of the need for same. In the event the director approves a design which proposes alleys, the alley shall be constructed as though it were a local street pursuant to the standards contained in these regulations.
(i)
Street jogs.
(1)
Street jogs shall either directly align or have offsets of a minimum of 125 feet for residential subdivision streets and a minimum of 200 feet for nonresidential subdivision streets, as measured between centerlines of said streets.

Maintenance surety. Maintenance surety provided to the city shall include the cost of sidewalk construction in an amount acceptable to the city.
e.
Escrow alternative. The cost of sidewalk installation may be set aside in escrow with the department of transportation if proposed road improvements by the city may impact the location of a sidewalk.
f.
Pursuant to a finding by the public works director that a sidewalk at a specific location would not provide a public benefit, funds may be contributed to the sidewalk bank in lieu of the sidewalk construction.
(2)
Sidewalk design and construction standards. Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of this section. The director is authorized to grant modifications upon specific application due to topographic or drainage difficulty as well as alternative design proposals after receiving a recommendation from the department of transportation.
a.
Width. Sidewalks shall be at least four feet wide on new internal subdivision streets, except sidewalks shall be at least five feet wide on new internal streets or drives within the Senior Oriented Residence District (R-SR). Sidewalks shall be at least five feet wide on abutting external streets.
