ARTICLE XIX. - APPENDIX OF INACTIVE ZONING DISTRICTS

Sec. 1900. - Purpose.
This appendix is provided as a reference for projects developed under prior to adoption of current regulations. No new zoning applications will be accepted for the following zoning districts.
(Ord. No. 2016-02-69, Exh. A, 2-28-2016)
Sec. 1901. - R-TH Single Family Residence Townhouse District.
(Prior to January 2005). This zoning district is intended primarily for rowhouse or townhouse attached or detached single-family dwelling units. Such dwelling units may be held in the condominium form of ownership, or in fee simple. It is not the intention of City of Peachtree Corners or of this ordinance to determine or dictate which form of ownership is most desirable.
Within the R-TH Single Family Residence Townhouse District, the following requirements shall be met:
a.
All dedicated street rights-of-way shall be a minimum of fifty (50) feet.
b.
Front and rear yard setbacks shall total a minimum of 75 feet with a minimum of 20 feet for a yard which faces on an interior street. If the subject property abuts property zoned R-60, R-75, R-100, or property developed as same, the rear yard setback shall be 40 feet at the point of abutment.
c.
Side yards shall be a minimum of 20 feet to any exterior property line. Side yards between individual units, groups of units or rows of units shall be determined based upon individual site plan review.
d.
Densities shall not exceed eight (8) units per gross acre.
A minimum of two (2) off-street parking spaces per unit shall be provided.
e.
A minimum of a two-(2)-hour rated firewall shall be required between each attached dwelling unit. A four-(4)-hour rated firewall shall be required between every fourth attached dwelling unit. Firewalls shall be constructed in accordance with applicable building codes of City of Peachtree Corners.
The specific requirements set forth above are not necessarily exhaustive of all requirements or conditions which the City Council may require prior to approval of any rezoning application under this district. This enactment specifically reserves, in the favor of the City Council, the discretion to deny any individual rezoning application submitted hereunder, if after review of the site plan and other materials submitted therewith and a careful consideration of all of the facts and circumstances relating to the proposed development, the City Council deems the proposed development not to be in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the present and future citizens of Peachtree Corners.
(Ord. No. 2016-02-69, Exh. A, 2-28-2016)
Sec. 1902. - R-ZT Single Family Residence Zero Lot Line/Townhouse District.
(Prior to January 2005). This district is intended to provide areas for the development of moderate density residential uses and structures in moderately spacious surroundings. It is intended that these districts be located in the urban and suburban portions of City of Peachtree Corners where a protected environment suitable for moderate-density residential use can be provided, as well as in established moderate-density residential areas as a means to ensure their continuance. The use of this district is also appropriate on a smaller scale in the suburban portions of the City as a transitional zone between low-density residential districts and commercial districts, industrial districts, or major transportation arteries, or other uses that are not compatible with a low-density residential environment. In fulfilling the intent of this district, the townhouse or rowhouse concept may be used which permits the construction of single-family dwellings immediately adjacent to one another without side yards between the individual units and which units may or may not be structurally connected. The intent of this district may also be fulfilled by the use of the Zero Lot Line concept, which permits the construction of detached single-family dwellings on lots without a side yard requirement on one side of the lot. This concept permits better use of the entire lot by compacting the usual front, rear and side yards into one or more internal gardens which may be completely walled in or screened.
A.
Within the R-ZT Single Family Residence Zero Lot Line/Townhouse District, the following uses are permitted:
1.
Zero Lot Line Single Family Detached Dwellings.
2.
Townhouses.
3.
Single Family Detached Dwellings.
4.
Customary Home Occupations (provided the building lot is a minimum of 60 feet in width and 7,200 square feet in area).
B.
Within the R-ZT Single Family Residence Zero Lot Lot/Townhouse District, the following requirements shall be met:
1.
Maximum density shall not exceed eight (8) units per acre for attached dwelling units and six (6) units per acre for detached dwelling units.
2.
Minimum lot width for Zero Lot Line or single family detached units - 40 feet. Minimum lot width for townhouse attached units - 22 feet. Zero Lot Line or single family detached lots shall maintain a minimum road frontage of 20 feet. Townhouse lots shall maintain a minimum road frontage of 15 feet.
3.
Minimum front yard depth shall be 20 feet.
4.
Minimum side yard depth - None for townhouses except that on corner lots the minimum side yard of the corner side shall be 20 feet. Zero lot line lots shall have a zero (0) foot side yard on one (1) side and a minimum of ten (10) feet on the opposite side. Single family detached units shall have a minimum five (5) foot side yard on each side.
5.
Minimum rear yard depth - When abutting an R-75 or R-100 district, the rear yard shall be equal to the required buffer plus an additional five (5) feet. However, the rear yard setback shall not be less than 25 feet.
6.
Maximum height - 35 feet or two and one-half (2Â½)stories.
7.
Provide two (2) or more off-street parking spaces per dwelling unit.
8.
Provide sidewalks adjacent to interior streets, excluding cul-de-sac turnarounds.
9.
Provide a minimum 40-foot building setback adjacent to exterior streets. The setback may be reduced to 30 feet if a berm, landscaping, fence or wall is provided adjacent to the exterior street(s).
10.
A maximum of eight (8) dwelling units shall be allowed in each row of townhouses. When an end unit of a townhouse row does not side on a street, an open space or court of at least twenty (20) feet in width shall be provided between it and the adjacent row of townhouses, and this open space shall be divided between the two (2) immediately adjacent townhouse lots as to property or lot lines.
11.
Where townhouse lots and dwelling units are designed to face upon an open or common access court rather than upon a street, this open court shall be a minimum of forty (40) feet in width and said court shall not include vehicular drives or parking areas.
12.
Townhouses shall be constructed up to side lot lines without side yards, and no windows, doors, or other opening shall face a side lot line except that that the outside wall of end units may contain such openings.
13.
Zero Lot Line dwellings shall be constructed against the lot line on one (1) side of a lot, and no windows, doors, or other openings shall be permitted on this side. The access for exterior maintenance shall be assured through a perpetual wall maintenance easement of five (5) feet in width, as necessary.
14.
A minimum of a two-(2)-hour rated firewall shall be required between each attached dwelling unit. A four-(4)-hour rated firewall shall be required between every fourth attached dwelling unit. Firewalls shall be constructed in accordance with applicable building codes of City of Peachtree Corners.
(Ord. No. 2016-02-69, Exh. A, 2-28-2016)
Sec. 1902.1. - All R-ZT Amendments to be Conditional Zoning Amendments.
All R-ZT Single Family Residence Zero Lot Line/Townhouse amendments to the Official Zoning Map shall be conditional amendments.

(Ord. No. 2016-02-69, Exh. A, 2-28-2016)
Sec. 1902.2. - Concept Plan Review.

Sec. 1904. - Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection: Stream Buffer Zones Required.
This section of the Zoning Resolution is adopted pursuant to the requirements of O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-453.
(Ord. No. 2016-02-69, Exh. A, 2-28-2016)
Sec. 1904.1. - Findings and Purposes.
The City of Peachtree Corners City Council finds that:
1.
The Chattahoochee River provides multiple benefits, which include use of the river as the primary water supply for metropolitan Atlanta.
2.
The water quality of the Chattahoochee River depends upon the water quality of the flowing streams tributary to the river.
3.
Sediment and other polluting materials and conditions, including, but not limited to, pesticides, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, toxic materials, and elevations in water temperatures, are harmful to the water quality of the river and its tributaries.
4.
The riparian vegetation along these watercourses helps preserve water quality. Dense tree growth helps to prevent stream bank erosion and streamside vegetation reduces the amount of sediment and other polluting materials that would otherwise wash into streams. Riparian trees, by shading, help maintain cooler water temperatures and thus enhance water quality.
Purposes are:
1.
Promote health, safety and general welfare; to minimize public and private losses due to erosion siltation and water pollution.
2.
Create vegetation buffer areas adjacent to tributary streams in the drainage basin of the Chattahoochee River.
(Ord. No. 2016-02-69, Exh. A, 2-28-2016)
Sec. 1904.2. - Stream Buffer Zone.
This protection area means the stream channel and the land area extending outward thirty-five (35) horizontal feet from the banks on either side of all flowing streams in the drainage basins of all tributaries of the Chattahoochee River located in [the] City of Peachtree Corners. A flowing stream is defined for the purpose of this section as any stream that is portrayed on the most current United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute quadrangle as a perennial stream Fifteen (15) feet adjacent to the stream bank of said area will be left as a natural buffer and 35-foot minimum will be left as an accessory building setback. (This is not a change in the minimum rear yard setback nor permission to build in the floodplain.) Stream buffer zone (i.e., 15 feet from bank) must be shown on final subdivision plats, commercial and industrial site plans and multi-family residential site plans.
(Ord. No. 2016-02-69, Exh. A, 2-28-2016)
Sec. 1904.3. - Permit Required.
No person shall engage in any land disturbing activity within the area without having obtained a development permit or building permit from the Department of Planning and Development.
No permit will be issued for any land disturbing activity within the protection area unless the land disturbing activity is for the purpose of constructing one (1) of the following:
1.
A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route, or a public utility including sanitary sewer lines.
2.
The construction of public utilities including sanitary sewer lines.
3.
A dam and/or impoundment, a detention, retention, or sediment control pond or facility.
(Ord. No. 2016-02-69, Exh. A, 2-28-2016)
Sec. 1904.4. - Exception.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
1.
Any public agency or its contractor.
2.
Any person performing work within a right-of-way of any public agency pursuant to a permit issued by such public agency.
3.
Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property provided a written factual report is presented to the Director of Planning and Development within ten (10) days.
4.
Any development which has received a development permit prior to the adoption of this Section.
5.
