Where flaggers are deemed necessary by the chief of police, they shall be furnished by the permittee at its own expense. Through traffic shall be maintained without the aid of detours, if possible. In instances in which this would not be feasible, the public works supervisor will designate detours. The city shall maintain roadway surfaces of existing highways designated as detours without expense to the permittee, but, in case there are not existing highways, the permittee shall construct all detours at its expense and in conformity with the specifications of the public works supervisor.

No utility owned by the city shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work be borne by the permittee. The cost of moving privately owned utilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with the person owning the utility. The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain, and protect them under, over, along, or across the work.

The permittee shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences, or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property or highways resulting from its failure to properly protect and carry out the work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any lawn area, the sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been backfilled. All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as near as possible to that which existed before such work began. The permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any trees or shrubs which exist in parking strip areas or easements across private property without first having notified and obtained the consent of the property owner, or in the case of public property, the public works supervisor.

Upon failure to do so within 24 hours after having been notified to do so by the public works supervisor, the work may be done by the city, and the cost thereof charged to the permittee.

ARTICLE V. - PEDESTRIAN EVENTS[3]

Footnotes:
--- (3) ---
Editor's note— An ordinance of January 19, 2022, amended the Code by, in effect, repealing former art. V, §§ 32-158—32-165, and adding a new art. V. Former art. V pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from an ordinance of October 18, 2017.

Sec. 32-158. - Purpose.
(a)
Requests to use public property. Groups have from time to time sought to use public property and roads in the city. Such may have included parades, demonstrations, marches, assembly, TV, movie, or ad filming, road closings and other. The city has reviewed the adverse impact events have on city services and residents.
(b)
Private uses of public property should not interfere with safety. It is in the public interest that the uses described not interfere with the rights of citizens not participating, nor endanger public safety, nor obstruct orderly flow of traffic. Thus it is proper for security, welfare, health and safety of citizens and for preservation of peace and order that rules be established. The Supreme Court held that government, to regulate competing uses of public forums, may impose a permit requirement on those wishing to hold a march, parade, or rally, and such must meet requirements. It may not delegate overly broad licensing discretion to a government official nor be based on the message. It must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and leave open ample alternatives for communication. The standards for the fee must use narrowly drawn, reasonable and definite standards.
(Ord. of 1-19-2022 )
Sec. 32-159. - Definitions.
(a)
Manager. The manager shall be the administrator for receipt and processing of applications for a permit for a parade, demonstration, march, rally, assembly, TV, movie or ad filming, road closing, or other use of public property and roads.
(b)
Organization or group. This shall apply to any entity or group of more than five individuals or their representatives.
(c)
Private purpose event.
