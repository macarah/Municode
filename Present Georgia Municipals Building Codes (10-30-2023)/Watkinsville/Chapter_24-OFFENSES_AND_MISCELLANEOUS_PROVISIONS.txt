Secs. 24-34—24-55. - Reserved.
ARTICLE III. - OFFENSES AGAINST PUBLIC SAFETY

Sec. 24-56. - Loitering or prowling.
(a)
A person commits loitering or prowling when such person is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.
(b)
Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is if the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify oneself, or endeavors to conceal oneself or any object. Unless flight or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to arrest, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or concern by requesting the person to identify oneself and explain such person's presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with this procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation was true and would have dispelled the alarm or concern.
(c)
A person committing the offense of loitering or prowling shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
(Ord. of 12-16-2020, § 26-47)
State Law reference— Similar provisions, O.C.G.A. § 16-11-36; ordinances proscribing loitering for purpose of procuring others to engage in sexual acts for hire, O.C.G.A. § 16-6-24.
Sec. 24-57. - Curfew for minors.
(a)
Findings. Law enforcement indicates that over time there has been an increase in juvenile crime; that persons under the age of 18 years are susceptible, by lack of maturity and experience, to participate in unlawful activity; that criminal activity from other areas appears to be infiltrating the county; and that there have been crimes such as substance abuse, entering autos, burglaries, damage to property, fighting, and other incidents.
(b)
Intent. The city desires to protect minors, seeks enforcement of parental control over and responsibility for minors, strives for protection of the public, and implements this provision for reduction of criminal activities not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances.
(c)
Prohibited. It is a violation when a juvenile wanders or loiters about the streets of the city or in or about any highway or any public place between 12:00 midnight and 5:00 a.m.
(d)
Police requests. The city council recognizes that in Mwangi v. State, 316 Ga. App. 52 (2012) the court held: "Even when officers have no basis for suspecting a particular individual, they may generally ask questions of that individual, ask to examine the individual's identification, and request consent to search, as long as police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required." The city council recognizes when an apparent juvenile declines to answer questions, provide identification or be searched, law enforcement sometimes needs additional tools to effectively police the community.
(e)
Parental control. The council has determined a curfew for those under the age of 18 years will help attain the foregoing objectives and diminish the undesirable impact of such conduct, and promote the public good, safety and welfare. Parental responsibility for whereabouts of minors is the accepted norm, and legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have demonstrated effectiveness in many cities. Law enforcement has reported the effectiveness of curfews in other counties such as Spalding, Clayton, Fayette, Cherokee, Chatham, Murray, Coffee, and Gwinnett. The city council has determined a curfew will increase parental responsibility for minors, decrease minor delinquency including criminal activity, and decrease truancy and tardiness.
(f)

Purpose. O.C.G.A. §§ 17-15A-2 and 17-15A-3 are followed and enforced by the city. O.C.G.A. § 17-15A-3 notes that criminal gang activity is a serious public safety concern; criminal trespass and criminal damage to property caused by graffiti on private property are crimes frequently associated with gang activity; and it is in the public interest to combat gang activity and contribute to general public welfare by improving the aesthetics of public views, and to compensate private property owners who are victims of such by using inmate labor to remove or obliterate graffiti visible from public roads or public property. Per O.C.G.A. § 17-15A-4, the city authorizes inmate labor to remove or obliterate such graffiti. Graffiti promotes blight and must be abated to avoid detrimental impact and prevent further spread of graffiti. Without prompt removal, other properties become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable to live and work.

Occupant means any person or sub-lessee, successor or assignee that has control over property.
Owner means any person, agent or entity having a legal or equitable interest in a property.
Permit means knowingly allowing graffiti or any failure, refusal or neglect to remove.
Property means any real or personal property and that which is affixed incidental or appurtenant to real property but not limited to any premises, house, building, fence, structure or any separate part thereof, whether permanent or not.
(d)

(e)
Notice of removal. The city may serve a written notice directing the owner/occupant to remove such graffiti and advising of the appeal procedure. The notice may be served in person or by U.S. mail, return receipt requested. If the owner/occupant cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting in a conspicuous place on the property for three days.
(f)
Abatement of nuisance. It shall be unlawful for the owner/occupant to fail to remove the graffiti within five days of notice.

If the city determines graffiti must be removed, such must be accomplished within five days of the hearing.
(h)
Removal. If the graffiti is not completely removed by the owner/occupant in five days, the city and/or its private contractor or inmates may enter such premises to remove graffiti. If the owner/occupant applied the graffiti, such owner/occupant shall be liable to the city for all such expenses. The city shall record the expenses incurred in abating graffiti and shall provide a statement of such costs to the owner/occupant. If any expenses remain unpaid after 30 days, the city may sue to recover all expenses incurred by the city in removing the graffiti, including attorney fees and court costs associated therewith.
(i)
Penalty. Any person violating this section may be punished by a fine up to $500.00 per instance, plus such person may be required to reimburse the city for expenses to remove the graffiti. The court may suspend or probate a portion or its entire sentence upon such conditions to include the restoring of the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed, or other remedial action.
(j)
Alternate enforcement. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from commencing any other available civil or criminal proceedings to abate a public nuisance under state law or city ordinance as an alternative, or in addition to, this section.

Sexually explicit nudity means a state of undress as to expose the human genitals or pubic area with less than a full opaque covering or the depiction of covered or uncovered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state which, to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value and predominantly appeals to the prurient interest, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity or sex.
(b)
No adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, or adult movie houses shall be located within 1,000 feet of any school building, school grounds, library, public park, playground, college campus, public place of worship, or area primarily for residential purposes.

Sec. 24-183. - Nudity generally; nude dancing.
(a)
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, relevant to the problems faced by the city, the city council notes the conditions and occurrences generally associated with adult entertainment establishments. The city council finds that adult entertainment establishments result in an increase in criminal behavior and create undesirable community conditions. An increase in disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, public indecency, public solicitation, violent crime, prostitution, exploitation of young women, drug use, drug trafficking, and loitering of individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other counties and municipalities that permit adult entertainment. Conditions in other counties and municipalities are depression of property values in neighborhoods surrounding adult entertainment, community blight, an increased burden on and expenditure for law enforcement, and an increase in the criminal case load due to the crime problems.
(b)
The city council recognizes that lawful adult entertainment implicates First Amendment protection, and it has no desire to censor or control protected speech. The city council has neither any animosity toward nude entertainment nor any desire to chill protected expression. The city council and police chief have had opportunity to review relevant portions of documentation available from the Georgia Municipal Association, including information from the 1994 St. Cloud Adult Use Regulation Report; report from Dr. Richard McCleary in the 2005 case involving Starship Enterprise of Atlanta, Inc., versus Fulton County; report from Dr. Richard McCleary in a 2005 case involving Reliable Consultants, Inc., versus City of Kennedale, Texas; relevant portions of a 2003 report from Dr. Richard McCleary to the Greensboro, North Carolina, city attorney; and a report from appraiser Peter Malin to the Dallas city attorney. This documentation is incorporated by reference and is officially made a part of the record. Additionally, the city council relies on such mayor's and council's own wisdom and common sense. The city council reasonably relies on the evidentiary foundation in City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S.Ct. 1382 (2000) and in Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 106 S.Ct. 925 to the effect that secondary effects are caused by the presence of even one adult entertainment establishment in a neighborhood.
(c)
The city council has a substantial interest in guarding against these undesirable secondary effects; in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare; and in preserving and protecting the quality of life in the city. The city council also wishes to guard against public indecency, which is a crime per O.C.G.A. § 16-6-8, and to guard against certain sexual contact provided for money, which is a crime per O.C.G.A. § 16-6-16.
(d)
The city council wishes to protect against neighborhood blight and downgrade of surrounding neighborhoods due to the problems and undesirable behavior associated with adult entertainment establishments. The city council finds the above-stated undesirable secondary effects will result in the city unless these regulations are imposed to limit such adverse effects. These regulations are meant to minimize the adverse effects, to preserve quality of life; to protect the public health, safety, welfare, and morals; and to maintain the integrity of this community, especially in residential areas and areas which have a church, school, day care center, governmental building, library, civic center, public park, or playground. These regulations are meant to promote these legitimate public and governmental interests in a way that will not infringe on the constitutional right of freedom of expression. The city council is not trying to preclude adult entertainment, but just attempting to regulate adult entertainment establishments to protect the public from the negative secondary effects. The city council has narrowly tailored these regulations to combat the negative secondary effects and protect the public health, safety, and welfare and to allow reasonable avenues of protected First Amendment communication. The city council has found no less restrictive alternative to these regulations that would adequately protect the public health, safety, and welfare. The restrictions posed by these regulations are no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the government interest above.
(e)
