Sec. 18-20. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
The city council finds that:
(1)
Studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy non-smokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer.
(2)
Tobacco use in the proximity of children and adults engaging in or watching recreational activities at city owned or operated facilities is detrimental to such children's and adults' health, and can be offensive to those using such facilities.
(3)
Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to the elderly, people with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer.
(4)
Cigarette butts are often discarded on the ground requiring maintenance expenses, diminish the beauty of the city's recreational facilities, and pose a risk to toddlers due to ingestion.
(5)
The CDC warns that nicotine is highly addictive, and e-cigarettes may contain other harmful substances. Nicotine can harm adolescent brain development, and young people who use e-cigarettes may be more likely to smoke cigarettes in the future, according to the CDC.
(6)
Atlanta, Alpharetta, Chamblee, Decatur, DeKalb County, Doraville, Douglasville, Duluth, Gainesville, Kennesaw, Marietta, Norcross, and Roswell voted to ban smoking in public parks.
(b)
Accordingly, the city council finds and declares that the purposes of this article are:
(1)
To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public parks;
(2)
To guarantee the right of non-smokers to breathe smoke-free air; and
(3)
To recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

The city council finds:

The Atlanta Journal Constitution and other news outlets have reported: "More than 500 people have been diagnosed with vaping-related breathing illnesses. An eighth death was reported this week," and "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 530 confirmed and probable cases have been reported in 38 states and one U.S. territory, up from 380 a week ago," and "Two-thirds of the cases involved 18- to 34-year-olds."

CNBC recently reported: "Senators Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, introduced a bill Thursday that would ban flavored e-cigarettes and apply cigarette taxes to the devices, among other measures aimed at curbing teen vaping. Called the Ending New Nicotine Dependencies (ENND) Act, the legislation would ban e-cigarette flavors other than tobacco, specify e-cigarette design standards, monitor the public health risks of using tobacco products, apply existing cigarette taxes to e-cigarettes and direct the Department of Health and Human Services to educate the public about health implications of using e-cigarettes. 'Vaping companies have hooked millions of our children on nicotine using e-cigarette flavors like "gummy bear," "Scooby snacks," and "strawberries and cream." This means massive health consequences for the next generation, and we have to end this addiction crisis,' Merkley said in a statement. 'We need to get these flavors off the market.'"
(4)
The CDC warns that nicotine is highly addictive, and e-cigarettes may contain other harmful substances. Nicotine can harm adolescent brain development, and young people who use e-cigarettes may be more likely to smoke cigarettes in the future, according to the CDC.

Additionally, in 2018, over a quarter of high schoolers (27.4 percent) were e-cigarette users, up 160 percent from 2014."
