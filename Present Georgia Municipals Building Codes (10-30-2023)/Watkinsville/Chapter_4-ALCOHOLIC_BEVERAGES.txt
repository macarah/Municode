Sec. 4-104. - New restaurant; temporary licenses.
(a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a person may apply as a qualified restaurant even though the establishment has not yet been in operation for the previous 12 months. Because it is not possible to determine if such restaurant has annual food sales which are 65 percent or more of its total gross sales and it is not possible to determine if such restaurant has annual food sales in excess of $150,000.00, the city may in its reasonable discretion consider the size and seating capacity of the restaurant, the size and seating capacity of any lounge in the restaurant, the size and type of kitchen facilities and all other relevant factors to determine if it appears substantially likely that the restaurant will qualify for a license under this article. If the city anticipates that the establishment will qualify for a license, it may vote to award the applicant a temporary license not to exceed 90 days. At or before the conclusion of the 90-day period, the city shall use a pro rata analysis to determine if the applicant is operating a qualified restaurant. If the city has determined that the restaurant is qualified under this article, the applicant may make application for a license under section 4-67.
(b)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, a nonprofit organization which has at least 75 members regularly paying monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual dues and has received and has maintained approval from the IRS as a 501(c)(3) organization, may apply for a temporary three-day special event license for consumption of malt beverages and wine (not distilled spirits, except one single day event, one time per year, upon approval of the city council, using as criteria all applicable standards and requirements; the applicant shall then comply with all applicable liquor serving requirements).
