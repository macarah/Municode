Sec. 3.1. - General procedure.
1.
No land disturbing activity of any kind shall begin on any land subject to these regulations without prior approval of the preliminary plat and construction plans as described hereinbelow, and in the zoning ordinance.
2.
Before any land is subdivided the owner of the property proposed, or his authorized agency, shall apply for and secure approval per the following procedures:
i.
Sketch plat and conceptual layout.
ii.
Preliminary plat.
iii.
Development permit approving the construction plans.
iv.
Final subdivision plat.
Multi-family, commercial and industrial subdivisions shall comply with these regulations.
The sketch plat and conceptual layout requirements are as follows: 24-inch by 36-inch sketch plat and concept plans for review by the mayor and council are required prior to formal initiation of the preliminary plat process. The sketch plat and conceptual layout shall be prepared per accepted professional standards. The mayor and council shall review the sketch plat and conceptual layout within 30 days of submission by the developer. The developer will be notified at least seven days in advance of the date and time of the mayor and council's review of these items.
The developer shall attend the meeting and be prepared to discuss the sketch plat and conceptual layout with the mayor and council. The purpose thereof is to save time and expense in reaching general agreement as to the form of the plat and the substance and parameters of the construction plans and the objectives of these regulations.
Items to be addressed in the preliminary plat and the construction plans include as follows: Compliance with zoning and subdivision and tree regulations, lot footprint and layout, building size, building layout and design (including design details that may help increase marketability and conformity with nearby structures), facade type (for example, masonry construction), building height, flood prevention, paving, curb and sidewalk, utilities, temporary structures, greenspace, recreational amenities, front entrance construction, maximum number and/or density of units, water and sewer lines and water and sewer connections, tree protection, stormwater detention, owners association and restrictive covenants, street lights, street signs, fencing, and vegetative buffer.
Promises and representations made by the developer in the sketch plat and conceptual layout are binding on the developer. The mayor and council shall approve, approve with conditions, or reject the sketch plat and conceptual layout, utilizing the standards and criteria of the subdivision regulations and of the city zoning ordinance. The sketch plat and concept plans shall establish the parameters for the preliminary plat, construction plans and final plat, and the developer shall not depart from these parameters. Approval of the sketch plat and conceptual layout does not constitute approval of the preliminary plat, construction plans or final plat. Nor does it establish any vested rights.
Sec. 3.2. - Responsible parties for application processing, summary table.
The following table summarizes the departments, directors, and others responsible for receiving, administering, reviewing, approving, and permitting various city applications. This chart is not a substitute for the actual text of these regulations, and in the event of any conflict, the actual text of these regulations shall govern.

  Sec. 3.3. - Impact analysis.
A traffic study, hydrology study and other studies of the impact of the subdivision are required prior to preliminary plat approval unless unnecessary for adequate consideration and a fully informed decision. The studies shall be prepared under the direction of the city engineer at the applicant's expense.
Every proposed subdivision capable of generating 1,000 average daily vehicle trips or more than 100 vehicle trip ends during a single hour, or more shall be accompanied by a traffic analysis prepared under guidelines available from the city engineer. Provided, however, if the location of the development warrants a lower threshold, in the judgment of the city engineer, a 500 ADT threshold may be utilized. Anticipated vehicle trips may be based upon the latest edition of trip generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. Negative impacts on area roads and intersections must be minimized in the design of the project. If the traffic analysis shall demonstrate that, following completion of the development, the surrounding roads and affected intersections included in the traffic analysis will operate at an unacceptable level of service during peak traffic flow, considering both projected traffic demand/capacity on the existing system and improvements proposed by the developer, this may be grounds for denial of approval.
Sec. 3.4. - Preliminary plat.
Before preparing the preliminary plat, the applicant shall schedule an appointment and meet with the city engineer and the city manager to discuss the procedure and the requirements. The city manager or his/her designee may advise the applicant to discuss the subdivision with officials who must eventually approve aspects of the subdivision. The preliminary plat shall be prepared by a licensed land surveyor, registered professional engineer or licensed landscape architect.

Existing streets that adjoin a subdivision boundary shall be deemed a part of the subdivision. The proposed street system within a subdivision shall have the right-of-way of existing streets extended no less than the required minimum width. Subdivisions that adjoin only one side of an existing street shall dedicate one-half of the additional right-of-way needed to meet the minimum width requirement for the street as a project improvement. If any part of the subdivision includes both sides of an existing street, all of the required additional right-of-way shall be dedicated.
g.
All right-of-way required for off-site improvements related directly to the subdivision, such as acceleration or deceleration lanes, shall be acquired by the developer at no expense to the city.
h.
Where, in the opinion of the city manager and the city engineer, it is necessary to provide for interparcel access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication of right-of-way to the boundary of such property and existing streets through the development.
(1)
Where an existing street on the adjoining property terminates at the boundary of the development or subdivision, the street shall be extended into the subdivision.
(2)
Where no street exists on the adjoining property, a temporary turnaround shall be provided at the boundary of the development or subdivision at an appropriate location.
3.
Street classifications. Streets, roads and highways are classified as local, minor collector, major collector, or arterials. The classification of each street is maintained in the public works department.
a.
Designation.
(1)
Streets shall be classified into a street hierarchy system as shown herein. Street design standards shall be based on road function and projected average daily traffic (ADT), calculated with trip generation rates published in the most recent edition of Trip Generation Manual by the Institute of Transportation Engineers.
(2)
For residential lots, this will generally be ten to 12 trips per day per family.
(3)
Trip generation rates from other sources may be used if applicant demonstrates these better reflect local conditions at the discretion of the city manager and city engineer.
(4)
Each street shall be classified and designed to that classification for its entire length. The applicant shall demonstrate that the distribution of traffic to the proposed street system shall not exceed the ADT thresholds for any of the proposed street classifications.
b.
Private streets.
(1)
If and when a plat indicates the construction of streets and utilities on private property, the owner shall indicate plans for the maintenance of such.
(2)
The construction specifications for such streets shall be the same as for public streets and access shall be provided over such streets to an existing public street having a right-of-way of not less than 50 feet.
(3)
The owner shall state, through an agreement prepared or approved by the city attorney, that the city shall have no responsibility for maintenance.
c.
Traffic impact studies.
(1)
To prevent/reduce traffic congestion and hazards and to ensure the safety and welfare of the traveling public, the developer shall provide traffic impact studies when the projected traffic exceeds 1,000 ADT combined for all entrances. Provided, however, if the location of the development warrants a lower threshold, in the judgment of the city engineer, a 500 ADT threshold may be utilized.
(2)
The traffic projection shall be based on the developer's most intense use allowed by the zoning on the property.
(3)
The scope of the traffic impact study will be based on the nature of the development, existing background traffic volumes and patterns, and future development along the adjoining corridors. The intent of the impact study is to identify the impacts to capacity, level of service, and safety to existing corridors and the actions required to mitigate these impacts.
(4)
The determination of the requirement for traffic impact studies shall be made by the city engineer using the above criteria. The design professional of record shall determine the scope of the impact study and obtain concurrence of the city engineer.
(5)
The traffic impact study and proposed mitigation measures will be provided and considered as part of the approval process for the preliminary plat.

(2)
Immediately following the spreading of the coarse aggregate, all material placed shall be compacted to the full width by rolling with a smooth wheel power roller of adequate size and weight to achieve compaction.
(3)
Any irregularities, areas of segregation, or depressions that develop under such rolling shall be corrected by loosening the material at these places and adding or removing material until the surface is smooth and uniform. The application of water, applied uniformly over the base course, may be required to achieve adequate compaction. Shaping and rolling shall be performed alternately as required to maintain a uniform compacted base until a surface or treatment has been applied to the base. Along curbs, headers and walls and at all places not accessible to the roller, the base course material shall be tamped thoroughly with mechanical tampers or approved hand tampers.
(4)
Graded aggregate base shall meet the requirements of Georgia DOT specifications for graded aggregate. Graded aggregate base compaction test shall be taken at an interval not exceeding one per 1,500 linear feet. No graded aggregated base shall be placed on muddy or frozen subgrade. The moisture content of the graded aggregate base shall be uniformly distributed and shall be adequate to allow compaction to the specified density. After the material placed has been shaped to line, grade and cross section, it shall be rolled until the course has been uniformly compacted to at least 100 percent of the maximum dry density when Group 2 aggregate is used, or to at least 98 percent of maximum dry density when Group 1 aggregate is used. The theoretical maximum dry density shall be established using the appropriate test methods of the Georgia DOT Sampling, Testing and Inspection Manual. Moisture content shall be within +/- 3 percent of the optimum content. Compaction test results shall be reported to the city engineer immediately after results are obtained.
(5)
After the base course has been installed and inspected, and before any surface is applied, all residential streets shall be primed with suitable asphaltic materials as per Georgia DOT Specification 412 unless asphalt paving commences within two weeks from acceptance of the certification from the period March 1 to December 1 or within 24 hours during the period December 1 to March 1.

If paving will not be completed within two weeks after the base course is completed during the period March 1 to December 1, then, the base will need to be primed in accordance with GDOT Standards with the roadway being barricaded thereafter. The above will be required within 24 hours during the period of December 1 through March 1.
(5)
One asphaltic concrete extraction test per type mix shall be taken per subdivision. Extraction test results shall be reported to the city immediately after results are obtained.
(6)
Asphaltic concrete compaction test for each type mix shall be taken at an interval not exceeding one per 1,000 linear feet per one lane of roadway. All asphalt courses shall be compacted to no less than 95.5 percent of the target density. Compaction ranges of 95.4 percent to 93.4 percent will require a specific and separate three-year maintenance bond in the amount of 20 percent of the paving costs for the street affected. Compaction less than 93.4 percent will be cause for rejection and rework of the street section affected. The maximum pavement mean air voids will not exceed 7.8 percent in any instance. Compaction testing shall be accomplished in accordance with the appropriate standardized protocols for the GDOT Sampling, Testing, and Inspection Manual. Compaction test results shall be reported to the city immediately after results are obtained.
(7)
Where a binder course is provided on streets, a tack coat shall be applied to all prepared road surfaces as provided in Georgia DOT Specifications.
(8)
On streets where a binder course is provided, the final layer of asphalt shall be placed no later than one year after the binder course is laid or when 80 percent of the project is built-out whichever comes first.
(9)
The city engineer shall require that all work meet or exceed the above requirements.
(10)
It is the design professional's duty to inspect that the roadway asphaltic concrete construction specifications have been met. The developer will provide to the city a statement of inspection completed by a registered professional engineer, licensed by the state, that all construction requirements have been met for roadway asphaltic concrete construction. Upon presentation and approval of such documentation by the city, roadway construction will be considered as complete for the purpose of final plat.
e.
Base, asphalt and compaction testing.
(1)
Depth testing. The city engineer reserves the right to require depth checks on base materials and asphalt cores shall be taken at random locations at 500-foot intervals along each road at the discretion of the city engineer or the code compliance officer. Any area found deficient shall be brought up to the required thickness prior to placing any additional layer of material. All asphalt core holes shall be filled with hot mix asphalt of similar grade prior to final acceptance.
(2)
Additional testing requirements/coordination. All testing shall be scheduled with the city engineer and the code compliance officer, or his/her duly appointed representative no less than 24 hours in advance. Compaction testing shall not be performed until the surface/material is to the lines and grades shown on the plans. Once an embankment, subgrade, or base course has been certified then that material shall not be disturbed or additional testing will be required. All areas or sections of the subgrade and base course, which do not pass compaction testing, shall be corrected. Once the developer makes all necessary corrections, it shall be his/her responsibility to schedule any and all subsequent test. The city engineer and the code compliance officer may require that in addition to the compaction testing required, a roll test be performed in accordance with these regulations. All certifications provided shall contain all test data and results to support certification.
f.
Seasonal limits. No roadway construction material shall be deposited or shaped when the subgrade is frozen at any depth or thawing at any depth or during unfavorable weather conditions including rain of any intensity. Paving material installation shall be subject to temperature and weather conditions as contained in Georgia DOT construction standards. The time period from December 1 to March 1 will require special construction procedures unique to the individual sites and weather conditions. The contractor/developer shall consult with the city engineer and the code compliance officer during a supplemental pre-construction conference prior to beginning or continuing any roadway construction work during this period. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to schedule this conference.
