ARTICLE V. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION

Sec. 10-124. - Description.
(a)
An illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to a municipal or county separate storm sewer system (stormwater drainage system) that is not composed entirely of stormwater runoff (except for discharges allowed under an NPDES permit or non-polluting flows). These non-stormwater discharges occur due to illegal dumping or illegal connections to the stormwater drainage system. This article provides the City with the authority to deal with illicit discharges and establishes enforcement actions for those persons or entities found to be in noncompliance or that refuse to allow access to their facilities.
(b)
Introduction. It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Discharges to the City separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
(2)
These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the City separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments;
(3)
These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters;
(4)
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
(5)
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the City separate storm sewer system;
(6)
Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the City separate storm sewer system.
Therefore, the City adopts the ordinance from which this article is derived to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the City separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the City separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
