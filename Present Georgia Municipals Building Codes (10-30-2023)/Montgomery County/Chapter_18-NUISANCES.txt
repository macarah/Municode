State Law reference— Nuisances, O.C.G.A. § 41-1-1 et seq.; jurisdiction of municipal court or magistrate court to abate nuisance, O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5; power of municipality to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise without limitation or impairment by provisions of state law, O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9.

Sec. 18-1. - Purpose.
It is important for a county to appear clean, well kept, and generally clear of public nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy conditions. The appearance of a county weighs heavily in the decisions of prospective residents and businesses in locating to a particular area. A clean, safe, and well-kept county can stabilize or increase property values, provide a healthy environment, and make citizens proud of the area in which they live. Accordingly, a county needs a set of regulations to keep the area clean, remove unsightly conditions, and prevent unhealthy and unsafe situations from occurring. It is therefore the purpose and intent of this chapter to encourage a clean, healthy, and satisfying environment; one free of nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy, unsafe, or devaluating conditions. To this end, this chapter seeks to regulate and protect the health, safety, welfare, values, and aesthetics of properties.
