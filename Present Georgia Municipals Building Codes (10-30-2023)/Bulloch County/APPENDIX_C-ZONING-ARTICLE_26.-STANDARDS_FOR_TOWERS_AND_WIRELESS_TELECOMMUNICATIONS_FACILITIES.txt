(Ord. of 6-4-02(2))
Section 2604. - Zoning districts.
(a)
Permitted uses. Subject to the requirements of this article, the following types of uses shall be permitted as a principal or accessory use in all zoning districts:
(1)
The attachment of antennas and related equipment or appurtenances to an existing tower or suitable alternative tower structure shall be permitted as an accessory use in all zoning districts.
(2)
Lattice towers, monopole towers, guyed towers, and antennas and related equipment or appurtenances shall be permitted as a principal or accessory use on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the county's governing authority or other public body corporate and politic in all zoning districts, provided a written license or lease authorizing such use has been approved by the county's governing authority or other public body corporate and politic. Towers on such publicly owned or controlled property shall be required to meet all the development standards of section 2605 with the exception of minimum lot size and minimum setback requirements.
(b)
Conditional uses. Subject to the requirements of this article, the following types of uses shall be permitted as conditional uses upon approval of a conditional use permit by the board of commissioners:

(Ord. of 6-4-02(2); Amd. Of 3-6-07)
Section 2605. - Development standards.
(a)
Minimum lot size. The minimum lot size requirements for zoning districts shall not apply to towers. However, the site or parcel on which the tower is located shall be of sufficient size to meet the minimum setback requirements in this article.
(b)
Minimum setback requirements. All towers shall be set back a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the right-of-way of Interstate 16 and a minimum of a distance equal to the height of the tower from other public rights-of-way, existing nonresidential structures designed or intended for human occupancy. With the exception of exterior property lines in the AG-5 district as provided herein, all towers shall be set back a minimum of a distance equal to the height of the tower from property lines of any adjacent property. For purposes of this provision, the boundaries of a leased parcel shall be considered the property lines of adjacent property. In HC, GC, LI and HI zoning districts, monopole towers shall be set back a minimum distance equal to the height of the tower from any existing residential structure on the property under consideration and two times the height of the tower from any residential zoning district, while guyed towers and lattice towers shall be set back a minimum distance equal to three times the height of the tower or 500 feet, whichever is greater, from any existing residential structure and/or residential zoning district. In AG-5 zoning districts, all towers must be set back a minimum distance equal to the height of the tower from any existing residential structure on the property under consideration and three times the height of the tower or 500 feet, whichever is greater, from exterior property lines. For purposes of this provision, the term "exterior property line" means the boundary of any parcel of property that is contiguous to and owned by a different owner than the parcel of property on which the tower is proposed to be located. Minimum setback distances shall not apply to residential structures locating in proximity to any existing guyed tower or any existing lattice tower; provided, however, that residential structures and nonresidential structures designed or intended for human occupancy shall not be allowed to locate any closer than the height of the tower to any existing tower. The setback and distance requirements in this provision shall not apply to any building related to the operation or maintenance of the tower. In the case of guyed towers the closest ground anchor shall be used for purposes of calculating setbacks from the right-of-way of Interstate 16. In all other cases the closest point of the base of the tower shall be used for purposes of calculating setbacks.
(c)
Structural design. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is designed, constructed, and maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) and the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), as amended from time to time. A tower must have the structural capacity to accommodate at least two other users with comparable loading requirements as the initial user.
(d)
Maximum height. The maximum height of towers in the AG-5 district and in all residential districts shall be 199 feet, unless the applicant sufficiently proves that a higher tower is necessary to provide required coverage. The mere fact that more towers less than 200 feet in height would be required to provide the same coverage as a single tower 200 feet or greater in height shall not be sufficient, in and of itself, to prove the necessity of the higher tower. In all zoning districts in which towers are permitted as a conditional use, the height of towers may be limited to minimize visual obtrusions in granting the conditional use permit. If at any time it is determined by the FAA or any successor agency that a tower or antenna is interfering with the operation of the Statesboro Municipal Airport or with the Statesboro Municipal Airport's ability to upgrade its status (such as to an instrument landing system facility), such tower or antenna shall immediately be modified to eliminate such interference. If the tower or antenna cannot be modified to eliminate the interference, then the tower or antenna shall immediately be removed by the owner. If the owner fails to remove such tower or antenna, then the governing authority may remove the tower or antenna at the owner's expense and the cost of removal shall constitute a lien upon the property on which the tower or antenna was located.
(e)
Illumination. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the zoning administrator, planning and zoning commission, or board of commissioners may review the available lighting alternatives approved by the FAA or any successor agency and require the alternative that would cause the least disturbance to surrounding property. In the absence of any special conditions or requirements imposed by the zoning administrator, planning and zoning commission, or board of commissioners, towers that require lighting shall utilize an FAA-approved dual lighting system with a Fresnel lens and/or a physical reflector mounted beneath the light to minimize the visual impact of the lighting on surrounding property at ground level.
(f)
Color and markings. Unless otherwise required by the FAA or other applicable authority, all towers shall be unmarked and shall have either a galvanized finished or be painted a dull blue, gray, or black finish. Where FAA marking is required, unless expressly prohibited by the FAA, the tower shall be lit with medium intensity strobe lights during the day in lieu of painting. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the zoning administrator may require the antenna and related equipment or appurtenances to be of a neutral color that is compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment or appurtenances as visually unobtrusive as possible. Camouflaged towers and those designed to look like trees shall be exempt from the requirements of this subsection.
(g)
Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices. Access to the tower shall be through a locked gate. For guyed towers, each ground anchor shall also be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height with the fence line set back at least ten feet from the ground anchor.
(h)
Landscaping. The visual impact of towers shall be mitigated through landscaping or other screening materials at the base of the tower and ancillary structures as follows:
(1)
A landscaped buffer area a minimum of ten feet in width shall be maintained around the exterior of the security fencing.
(2)
The landscaped buffer area shall consist of materials of the evergreen variety sufficient to provide screening that will minimize the visual impact of the tower.
(3)
All required landscaping shall be properly maintained to ensure good health and vitality.
(4)
The use of existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and may be credited as appropriate toward meeting landscaping requirements.
(5)
Camouflaged towers and those designed to look like trees shall be exempt from the requirements of this subsection.
(6)
Applicants may submit for approval alternative landscaping plans that meet the purposes of this subsection to limit the visual impact of towers. In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether.
(i)
No Advertising. Neither the tower nor the tower site shall be used for advertising purposes and shall not contain any signs for the purpose of advertising. Name plates and FCC tower registration numbers for the purpose of self-identification shall not be considered advertising.
(j)
Federal and state requirements. All towers and antennas must meet or exceed then-current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal or state governments with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations as mandated by the controlling federal or state agency.
(k)
Pre-existing towers/non-conforming uses. All towers operative on the effective date of this ordinance shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a non-conforming use or structure in accordance with section 403 of this appendix. Provided, however, that no later than January 1, 2003, the owners of any such pre-existing towers that are lighted shall install an FAA-approved Fresnel lens and/or a physical reflector mounted beneath the light to minimize the visual impact of the lighting on surrounding property at ground level. Additional antennas and related equipment or appurtenances may be co-located on or around pre-existing towers, provided that a permit for such co-location is obtained in accordance with this article.
(Ord. of 6-4-02(2); Amd. of 1-3-06; Amd. Of 3-6-07)
Section 2606. - Application procedures.
(a)

(1)
Erect, construct in place, re-erect, or replace, any tower;
(2)
Locate or co-locate any telecommunications facilities on or around a pre-existing tower for which a permit has not been obtained in accordance with this article;
(3)
Locate any telecommunications facilities on an alternative tower structure; or
(4)
Modify any existing tower (or any alternative tower structure that currently serves the function of a tower) by increasing the height thereof.
Applications for building permits and informational submittals under this article shall be submitted to the zoning administrator or his designee and shall be accompanied by the appropriate fee as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the clerk of the board of commissioners.
(b)
Submittals. A complete application shall contain the following:
(1)
A site plan or plans to scale specifying the proposed location and dimensions of the tower; if lighting is required, the proposed lighting system and alternative lighting systems that would meet FAA approval; size of accessory buildings or uses; access; parking; fences; landscaping plans; existing and adjacent land uses; proposed distance of the tower from existing structures, buildings, overhead utility lines, public rights-of-way, and adjacent property lines; and utilities inventory indicating the locations of all drainage, power lines and any other items as impacting the proposed tower site. The site plan shall show all public views and all features which screen public views and adjacent property views from the proposed tower.
(2)
Visual simulations of the proposed tower or alternative tower structure illustrating the potential visual impact. The applicant shall submit visual simulations of the proposed tower or alternative tower structure that are to scale and that include all initial and future co-location antennas (including proposed coaxial cable runs for each proposed antenna). The visual simulations can consist of photo simulations or other means which accurately depict the proposed structure as it would be seen from adjacent properties and the public view, including but not necessarily limited to the nearest public roadway and the public roadway from where the structure would be most visible, if that point is not the nearest public roadway. Such visual simulations shall be accomplished by utilizing a balloon test and/or GPS coordinates in order to accurately depict the visual impact of the tower or alternative tower structure from these various locations. The applicant shall seek to obtain the consent of all adjacent property owners for purposes of going onto their property in order to accurately create the visual simulations. If such consent is granted, the applicant shall create visual simulations from the location where the proposed tower would be most visible from each habitable existing structure on the adjacent property, and up to two additional locations if specifically requested by the property owner and, if no such locations are requested, from the location from which the proposed tower or alternative tower structure would be most clearly visible. The applicant shall exercise due diligence and good faith in attempting to obtain the consent of adjacent property owners and must provide a detailed explanation of its efforts to do so if such consent is denied.
(3)
A report from a licensed professional engineer, documenting the following:
(A)
Tower height and design, including structural and technical engineering, and other pertinent factors governing the proposed tower design. A cross-section of the tower structure shall be included.
(B)
Total anticipated structural capacity of the tower, including number and types of antennas which can be accommodated.
(C)
Evidence of structural integrity of the tower.
(D)
Failure characteristics of the tower and demonstration that the site, setbacks and separation from other uses are of adequate size or distance.
(E)
If the application is for an antenna or antennas and related equipment or appurtenances to be located or co-located on a pre-existing tower or located on an alternative tower structure, the engineer's report shall document that the pre-existing tower or alternative tower structure has the structural capacity to support the additional antenna or antennas and related equipment or appurtenances and that the additional antenna or antennas and related equipment or appurtenances will not overstress the pre-existing tower or alternative tower structure.
(4)
Certification from a qualified radio frequency engineer that the tower and/or antenna(s) and related equipment or appurtenances:
(A)
Comply with all current regulations of the FCC, with specific reference to FCC regulations and guidelines governing nonionizing electromagnetic radiation (NIER).
(B)
Are not expected to result in harmful interference to any existing or previously proposed Public Safety Telecommunications service.
(5)
Written documentation from the FAA that the FAA has determined that the tower and/or antenna(s) and related equipment or appurtenances is not identified as an obstruction and would not be a hazard to air navigation.
(6)
Identification of the geographic service area to be served by the subject installation, including accurately scaled color radio frequency (RF) plotted maps showing coverage from all sites providing service within the county from the applicant's existing network and including the proposed site. Where the proposed site does not result in continuous coverage within the county, when coupled with other existing sites providing service, the maps shall also depict the nearest associated telecommunications facility site(s) within the network. RF maps shall also be provided which depict the proposed coverage, comparing coverage of the proposed facility with coverage from all potential co-location sites within a one-mile radius of the proposed site and containing sufficient engineering data to show that said sites would not be feasible to fill significant, required service gaps.
(7)
If the application is for a new tower or towers, the applicant must identify all existing towers, all alternative tower structures, and all towers for which applications are currently pending which are located within the applicant's search area. This shall include, as it relates to the applicant's proposed site, a description of the distance and location of all such towers and alternative tower structures, both within and outside the applicant's network. The applicant must provide specific, detailed evidence with regard to each identified tower or alternative tower structure that it cannot accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna(s) and related equipment or appurtenances and that co-location is therefore not possible. Such evidence may consist of the following:
(A)
No existing towers or alternative tower structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
(B)
Existing towers or alternative tower structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
(C)
Existing towers or alternative tower structures do not have sufficient structural capacity to support applicant's proposed antenna(s) and related equipment or appurtenances.
(D)
The applicant's proposed antenna(s) would cause harmful electrical interference with the antenna(s) on or near the existing towers or alternative tower structures, or the antenna(s) on or near the existing towers or alternative tower structures would cause harmful electrical interference with the applicant's proposed antenna(s).
(E)
The addition of the applicant's proposed antennas would cause the existing tower to exceed FCC guidelines for RF exposure at or beyond the site fence.
(F)
The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to utilize an existing tower or alternative tower structure or to adapt an existing tower or alternative tower structure for utilization are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable.
(G)
The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and alternative tower structures infeasible.
(8)
If the application is for a new tower, the applicant must submit a letter of intent committing the tower owner and his or her successors to allow the shared use of the tower if an additional user agrees in writing to meet reasonable terms and conditions for shared use.
(9)
The applicant shall submit a site inventory and future facilities plan to include the following:
(A)
An inventory of all of the applicant's existing and proposed telecommunications facility sites within the county and within one mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower, and the current users and remaining capacity of each existing tower.
(B)
Where the RF coverage maps required by section 2606(b)(6) depict areas within the county which, with the addition of the proposed telecommunications facility remain unserved, the applicant shall include an affirmative statement that it does not intend to serve such areas or shall set forth the timeframe in which such additional area is intended to be served and the number and approximate location of proposed telecommunications site(s) that will be needed to provide service to the unserved area(s).
(C)
Where an applicant proposes to add a telecommunications site in an area that, in a prior submission to the county had been shown as receiving service, the applicant shall fully explain why the previously depicted coverage was not obtained or proved inadequate. The applicant shall also include an affirmative statement as to what steps have been taken to ensure that the RF maps submitted with the instant proposal are of higher accuracy and shall explain, in detail, what steps have been taken to increase the accuracy of the current coverage map over the previously submitted map.
(c)
Informational submittals. Any person or entity co-locating an antenna or antennas and related equipment or appurtenances or replacing existing antenna(s) on or around a tower for which a permit has already been issued shall submit the following for information only:
(1)
The name of the person or entity co-locating on the tower.
(2)
The name of the owner of the tower.
(3)
The tower's permit number.
(4)
The location of the tower.
(5)
Certification from a licensed professional engineer that the tower has sufficient structural capacity to accommodate the proposed additional loading without becoming over stressed.
(6)
Certification that the antenna(s) and related equipment or appurtenances comply with all current regulations of the FCC, with specific reference to FCC regulations and guidelines governing non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation (NIER).
(d)
Independent expert review. In addition to any permit fees for a new tower or increase in height to an existing tower, the applicant shall be required to pay to Bulloch County an independent expert review fee as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges per application at the time the application is filed. If the actual cost to Bulloch County for independent expert review of the application is greater than this initial fee, the applicant shall be billed for the difference and payment shall be made prior to the hearing before the board of commissioners.
(e)
Forms. The zoning administrator is authorized to develop application forms to assist in providing the required information and facilitate the application process.
