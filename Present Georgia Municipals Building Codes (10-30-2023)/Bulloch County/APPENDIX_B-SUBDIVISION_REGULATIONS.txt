ARTICLE IV. - PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL

4.1. - Four-step review.
The procedure for review, consideration, and approval of a subdivision plat consists of four separate steps. These are:
(a)
Review of sketch plans by the building and zoning official, county engineer, county planner and public safety director;
(b)
Consideration and approval of sketch plan by planning and zoning commission;
(c)
Review of preliminary plat (unless no new streets are involved and all lots are larger than three acres) by the building and zoning official, county engineer and public safety director; and
(d)
Review of final plat by the building and zoning official and engineer.
Approval at steps (a), (c) and (d) is contingent upon full compliance with requirements of this ordinance. Approval at step (b) is discretionary. Steps (a), (b) and (c) shall be completed prior to making any street improvement or installing any utilities. Step (d) shall be completed prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision.
4.2. - Review procedure.
The following procedure shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats:
4.2.1. Sketch plan review procedures. At least 25 days prior to the regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the planning and zoning commission, the subdivider shall submit to the building and zoning official and the planning and zoning commission or its representative ten copies of a sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. If phase development is contemplated, then a sketch plan for each phase will be required simultaneously. Included with the sketch plan must be a sketch map which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning necessary for the preparation of the preliminary plat and to enable the subdivider to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. Utilizing the comprehensive plan and zoning ordinance, the building and zoning official and the planning and zoning commission shall review and approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the sketch plan within 45 days from the meeting at which it is considered. Pertinent comments and recommendations shall be noted in the minutes of the planning and zoning commission meeting. Failure of a subdivider to submit a preliminary plat within 18 months from the approval of the sketch plan will require resubmittal of the sketch plan to the planning and zoning commission for reconsideration.
4.2.2. Preliminary plat procedures.
(a)
Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the building and zoning office after approval of the sketch plan. The plat of the subdivision shall be submitted in four blue line prints and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained herein. Any preliminary plat submitted to the building and zoning office shall contain the name, phone number, and address of the subdivider (or subdivider's designee); and no preliminary plat shall be approved by the building and zoning office without full compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. Actions by the building and zoning official may be appealed to the planning and zoning commission. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the subdivider or designee to the address listed on the plat not less than five days before the hearing date fixed. Appeals from a decision of the planning and zoning commission shall be heard by the governing authority, with the same notice of hearing provided. All appeals must be filed within 30 days of the date on which the action being appealed was taken.
(b)
Additional copies of the plat and supplemental information may be requested by the building and zoning official. The above-mentioned copies shall be distributed as required by section 5.2.4 of this ordinance and additionally as deemed necessary by the building and zoning official. The person or agency to which a copy of the preliminary plat is directed shall indicate any desired changes or comments on the plat and submit the plat to the building and zoning office prior to formal approval of the preliminary plat.
(c)
The building and zoning official shall act on the preliminary plat within 30 days after formal submission, and, if approved, shall indicate in writing, stating the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express in writing his disapproval and the reasons therefor. Failure of the building and zoning official to act within 30 days after formal submission of the preliminary plat shall be deemed to constitute approval and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the building and zoning official on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period.
(d)
Preliminary approval of the subdivision plat shall be noted on the plat and certified by the building and zoning official. Also noted shall be the date on which the building and zoning official granted preliminary approval and the date of written notification to the subdivider or subdivider's authorized agent. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within 18 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require resubmittal of a sketch plan to the planning and zoning commission for approval, unless an extension is requested by the subdivider and approved by the planning and zoning commission.
(e)
Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets and the dimensions and shapes of lots subject to the final approval of the county health department. Application for approval of the final record plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified herein have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the building and zoning official, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat.
4.2.3. Final plat procedure. Application for final approval of the subdivision plat shall be submitted to the building and zoning official after approval of the preliminary plat (where applicable). Six copies of the final plat are required. The building and zoning official shall examine the final plat to determine if it meets all requirements of these regulations, conforms to the approved preliminary plat, and whether streets and easements qualify for dedication. If roads are to be built, subdivider will indicate such subdivider's proposal for a bond or bank letter of credit to the governing authority to assure their proper and timely construction. The building and zoning official shall grant approval or require the subdivider to make necessary modifications to conform to the standards required by the final plat. Actions of the building and zoning official and decisions of the planning and zoning commission may be appealed under the same procedure as outlined in section 4.2.2. If approved, a plat can be recorded in the clerk's office of the Bulloch County Superior Court upon authentication by the building and zoning official. For purposes hereof, authentication shall be in the following form, to wit: Approved for recording on the _____ day of _______, 20___, by the Bulloch County building and zoning official.
(Amend. of 10-3-06)
4.3. - Reserved.
4.4. - Federal Housing Administration approval.
In the event the subdivider plans to secure approval of the subdivision design by the Federal Housing Administration, it is suggested that such approval be secured after submission to and approval of a preliminary plat by the building and zoning official.
4.5. - Approval of subdivision in flood prone area.
No portion of a subdivision which is subject to inundation by a flood of 100-year frequency or less shall be approved unless it conforms to the Bulloch County Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance and other local, state, and federal laws and regulations. All subdivisions must be designed to minimize flood damage; all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems shall be located, elevated and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; adequate drainage must be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; adequate drainage must be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharges from the system into the floodwaters; on-site waste disposal systems must be located so as to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during flooding.

5.3.2. Permanent reference points. Prior to the approval of the final plat, all of the subdivision's permanent reference points shall have been placed in accordance with the following requirements:
(a)
Subdivision corner tie. At least one corner of the subdivision shall be designated by course and distance (tie) from a readily discernible reference marker. If a corner is within 2,000 feet of a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Station, U.S. Geological Survey, or Georgia Grid System coordinated monument, then this corner shall be marked with a monument so designated by computed X and Y coordinates which shall appear on the map with a statement identifying this station or monument to an accuracy of 1:10,000. When such a monument or station is not available, the tie shall be made to some permanent and readily recognizable landmark or identifiable point, physical object or structure. In subdivisions of more than ten lots, the information for this corner tie shall include elevation above sea level making it in effect a benchmark which can be used to determine if individual lots are in a flood prone area.
(b)
Monuments.
(1)
Monuments shall be located in the ground at all angles in the boundaries of the subdivision; at the intersection lines of streets and at the intersection of the lines of streets with boundaries of the plat and at the intersection of alleys with the boundaries of the subdivision; at all points of curvature, points in the side lines of streets and alleys; and at all angles of an intermediate traverse line.
(2)
It is not intended or required that monuments be placed within the traveled portion of a street to mark angles in the boundary of the subdivision if the angle points can be readily reestablished by reference to monuments along the side lines of the streets.
(3)
All required monuments shall be placed flush with the ground where practicable.
(4)
If the required location of a monument is in an inaccessible place, or where the location of a monument would be clearly impracticable, it is sufficient to place a reference monument nearby and the precise location thereof shall be clearly indicated on the plat and referenced to the true point.
(5)
All monuments used shall be made of a minimum of solid iron or steel bars at least one-half inch in diameter and 24 inches long.
(6)
If a point required to be monumented is on a bedrock outcropping, a steel rod at least one-half inch in diameter shall be drilled and grouted into solid rock to a depth of at least eight inches.
(c)
Control corners. Within each block of a subdivision at least two monuments designed and designated as control corners shall be installed. All control corners shall be constructed of concrete and shall be at least four inches in diameter or square and not less than three feet in length. Each monument shall have imbedded in its top or attached by a suitable means, a metal plate of noncorrosive materials and marked plainly with the point, the surveyor's registration number, the month and year it was installed and the words "control corner."
(d)
Property markers. A steel or wrought iron pipe or the equivalent not less than one-half inch in diameter and at least 24 inches in length shall set all corners, except those located by monuments.
(e)
Accuracy. Land surveys, both within the limits of incorporated areas and beyond shall be at an accuracy of at least 1:7,500.
(Amend. of 10-3-06)
ARTICLE VI. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS

6.1. - Number of lots versus improvement standards.
By permitting varying numbers of lots and varying levels of improvements, regulations enable the small developer to provide for growth in the rural, more slowly developing area of the county characterized by a lower lot absorption rate. Less restrictive development standards are imposed according to quantity of lots to allow for flexibility in subdivision sizes.
EXPAND
Subdivision Type Number of lots Required Improvements
Minor subdivision 10 or less Site grading for adequate drainage; street signs; paved streets
Intermediate subdivision 11 to 49 Site grading for adequate drainage; community water supply and distribution system (unless all lots are five acres or larger); street signs; paved streets.
Major subdivision 50 or more Paved streets; community water supply and distribution system (unless all lots are five acres or larger); sewage system if soil is unable to support the required number of on-site sewage disposal units; storm drainage system.
Planned residential development (as defined in section 203 of appendix C, zoning) N/A Paved streets; community water supply and distribution system; sewage system; storm drainage system.
  (Ord. of 2-6-01; Amd. of 12-2-03)
6.2. - Required improvements.
A well-designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat.
6.2.1. Natural gas. Gas lines will not be allowed in a right-of-way.
6.2.2. Water supply. When a required water system is installed, water mains shall provide a minimum flow of water of 500 gallons per minute for four minutes or 250 gallons per minute for two hours at the furthermost point from the tank. Fire hydrants shall be provided at distances not greater than 1,000 feet apart. The water main may be located in the right-of-way but may not be located under the pavement. Water lines three-fourths-inch in size shall be stubbed-out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced. When connection to a municipal or county water system is not available, the governing authority may make an exception to this rule. The water system shall be a permitted community water system as required by the State of Georgia Safe Water Drinking Act. An approved, signed copy from EPD (environmental protection division) of the water system plans must be submitted prior to final plat approval. Well sites should be of sufficient size to accommodate and adequately maintain the well and storage tank; provided, however, that the well shall be located no closer than 50 feet to any exterior property line of the subdivision.
6.2.3. Sanitary sewage. If a sanitary sewer is installed in a subdivision, sanitary sewers shall be installed to the plans and specifications approved by and in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county health department. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed-out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street.
6.2.4. Sewage disposal systems. Prior to the construction of any community sewage disposal system, such as private septic tanks, an oxidation pond or other facility, the location, size, plans and specifications of such a facility shall be approved by and be in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the governing authority and the county health department.
6.2.5. Curb and gutters. If concrete curbs or paved valley type gutters are required, they shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by an engineer, registered surveyor or architect, and approved by the county engineer or the local governing authority or its designee.
6.2.6. Street grading and surfacing. Street grading, base preparation, and surfacing shall be carried out by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the county and the Georgia Department of Transportation.
6.2.7. Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the county engineer.
6.2.8. Street name signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections within a subdivision. The location and design shall be approved by the governing authority or its designee.
6.2.9. Topsoil. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover on the lots and at least four inches of cover between sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting.
6.2.10. Paving. In all subdivisions, regardless of size, if the minimum lot size is less than 20,000 square feet or the minimum lot width is less than 100 feet, paving will be required for all streets, including private streets, within the subdivision.
6.2.11. Reserved.
6.2.12. Subdivision entrances. At the sketch plan stage, the planning and zoning commission may limit the number of entrances, driveways, or "curb cuts." At the preliminary and final plat stages, the building and zoning official shall coordinate with the county manager, county engineer, and public safety director with respect to entrances, driveways, or "curb cuts." Design standards on county or state roads shall be consistent with all state, federal, and local laws and applicable ordinances, including the Georgia Department of Transportation Rules and all amendments or revisions in effect as of the date of the preliminary plat approval. At the sketch plan stage, the planning and zoning commission may consider safety as well as require available alternatives for reducing the number of entrances, driveways or "curb cuts."
(Ord. of 2-6-01; Amd. of 3-4-03; Amd. of 2-3-05)
6.3. - Final plat revisions.
If it should become necessary to revise a final plat due to a dimensional error, a revised plat shall be submitted to the county clerk of court for final recording after the building and zoning official has approved and signed the revised plat.
6.4. - Performance bonds or bank letters of credit.
In lieu of the installation and completion of required improvements prior to the final approval of a plat, the governing authority or its designee may accept a bond or bank letter of credit, in an amount and with a surety or bank and containing conditions and terms satisfactory to it, providing for and securing to the county a period specified by the governing authority or its designee and expressed in the bond or bank letter of credit; and the county is hereby granted the power to enforce such bonds or bank letters of credit by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies. The form of performance bond or bank letter of credit is subject to approval by the governing authority or its designee.
6.5. - Acceptance of streets by the county.
The county shall not accept title to or assume responsibility for maintaining any street until at least one year after the street has been paved and until at least 50 percent of the lots have been built upon.
6.6. - Private streets.
A street which is not accepted as a public street shall have the status of "private street." Private streets may be approved for development only when they are eligible for categorization as a local street. Said street shall be designed so as to prohibit through traffic. To allow for installation of utilities, there will be a 60-foot easement indicated on the plat. Any private street shall be developed to present county standards. For subdivisions having five or fewer tracts or lots, a private street shall be exempted from the paving requirements except as provided in section 6.2.10. Prior to the issuance of building permits for lots within the development, the developer shall file with the county manager a release of maintenance agreement, releasing the county from any present or future maintenance of said streets. A sign indicating the existence of a private street will be erected at the intersection of each public street and private street. A disclosure statement shall be present on all plats of the subdivision and/or individual lots and included in all sales contracts. The statement shall set forth the ownership of the streets, the rights of purchasers and others to use the streets, provisions and responsibilities for maintenance and liability, and the rights of purchasers to enforce said provisions. Further, the statement shall advise purchasers that the county board of commissioners is not responsible for the maintenance of private streets. Each lot owner shall have title to the centerline of the private street adjacent to his lot subject to the 60-foot easement described herein. An alternative is the establishment of a responsible association with the authority to maintain the private streets.
6.7. - Access.
The planning and zoning commission shall not approve a subdivision in a location where the existing roads providing primary access are inadequate to serve the additional traffic generated by the development. If the ditches on existing county roads are to be used for drainage from the subdivision, the developer will re-grade said ditches and provide an all-weather drainage outlet. All re-grading and drainage outlets shall be approved by the governing authority or its authorized representatives.
ARTICLE VII. - DESIGN STANDARDS

In-place density tests and thickness measurements of graded aggregate base shall be conducted at a frequency of one test per 1,500 linear feet per two lanes. All testing documentation shall be provided to the county engineer. Both subgrade and graded aggregate base shall be proof rolled with the county engineer or his designee present.
7.1.1. Conformity to existing maps or plans. The location and width of all proposed streets shall (if applicable) be in conformity with official plans and maps and with existing amended plans of the planning and zoning commission.
7.1.2. Continuation of adjoining street system. The proposed street layout shall be coordinated with the street system of the surrounding area. Where possible, existing major streets shall be extended.
7.1.3. Access to adjacent properties. Where it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property and a temporary turnaround shall be provided. Houses fronting on minor streets shall have access from minor streets only.
7.1.4. Street names. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name of the proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, irrespective of the use of suffix, street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, etc. It shall be unlawful for any person in laying out any new street or road to name such street or road on any plat, by marking or in any deed or instrument, without first obtaining approval of the county manager or his designee.
7.1.5. Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through-traffic will be discouraged.
7.1.6. Trees. It is recommended that as many trees as possible remain on the site during the initial clearing and grading and that trees normally remain unless they lie within a planned public right-of-way, within a planned building site or within the necessary paved areas surrounding or adjacent to the primary structure.
7.1.7. Railroads and highways (freeways, expressways). Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
(a)
In residential districts a buffer strip not less than 25 feet shall be provided adjacent to the railroad rights-of-way or limited access highways. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be so designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs by the owner. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited."
(b)
If applicable, in districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
(c)
All other streets which are parallel to the railroad, when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade, shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
7.1.8. Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets by less than 125 feet shall be prohibited.
7.1.9. Right angle intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly a right angle as practicable.
7.1.10. Cul-de-sac. All dead end streets shall be provided with a turnaround having a roadway diameter of at least 60 feet and a right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet. Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a turnaround having a 30-foot radius or as approved by the public safety director.
7.1.11. Alleys. Service alleys or drives may be required in multiple dwelling, commercial, and industrial developments and shall have a minimum width of 15 feet, but shall not be provided in one- and two-family residential developments unless the subdivider provides evidence satisfactory to the planning and zoning commission of the need for alleys.
7.1.12. Street right-of-way widths. Minimum street right-of-way widths shall be as follows:

A curve shall be introduced at any change in direction of a collector, industrial or commercial service street or major thoroughfare. On major thoroughfares the centerline radius of curvature shall be determined by the state department of transportation or county engineer. On collector, industrial or commercial service streets, the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 350 feet. On minor streets, the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 150 feet unless the topography of the land to be subdivided makes this impractical.
7.1.15. Street grades. Grades on major thoroughfares shall be established by the state department of transportation or county engineers. Grades on collector streets shall not exceed eight percent unless topographic conditions make this impractical. Grades on minor residential streets shall not exceed 15 percent, unless topographic conditions make this impractical. All road side ditches shall have a minimum grade of not less than one-half of one percent.
