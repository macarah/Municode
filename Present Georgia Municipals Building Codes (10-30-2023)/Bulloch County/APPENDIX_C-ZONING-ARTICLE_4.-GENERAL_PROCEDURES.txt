No building shall be erected, used, occupied, moved or altered nor shall any use be allowed that does not conform to the requirements specified for the district in which such building or use is located, except that all buildings or uses not in conformity with the district requirements which lawfully existed at a particular location at the time this ordinance was originally adopted (November 4, 1994) may be continued but only as provided in Section 403, "Continuance of nonconforming uses or structures."
Section 403. - Continuance of nonconforming uses or structures.
A lawful use of or vested right to use any building, structure or land existing at the time of the original adoption of this ordinance (November 4, 1994) or the adoption of any amendment thereto may be continued subject to the restrictions contained in this appendix even though such use does not conform with the regulations of this appendix except that:
(1)
A nonconforming use or structure shall not be changed to another nonconforming use or structure.
(2)
A nonconforming residential or agricultural structure, provided the use therein is a permitted use, may be enlarged, provided it is an improvement, subject to building codes and regulations, to come into conformity with the zoning district development standards, after the date of original adoption of this ordinance (November 4, 1994) or the adoption of any amendments thereto.
(3)
A nonconforming use shall not be reestablished after discontinuance for six months regardless of any reservation of an intent not to abandon.
(4)
Any intended nonconforming use for which a vested right was acquired prior to the original adoption of this ordinance (November 4, 1994) or the adoption of an amendment thereto shall be prohibited unless such is actually commenced within one year of the original adoption of this ordinance (November 4, 1994) or the adoption of an amendment thereto regardless of the intent or expectation to commence or abandon such nonconforming use.
(5)
A nonconforming structure shall not be rebuilt, altered, or repaired except as provided herein:
a.
If the structure is altered or repaired, such alterations or repairs shall be an improvement and in conformity with the building codes and development standards (except for minimum lot area) in force at the time of such alteration or repair.
b.
If the structure is totally rebuilt, the replacement structure shall conform with all the requirements and development standards (except minimum lot area) of this ordinance, except as to the uses permitted in the particular district.
Section 404. - Height of fences and walls in a residential zoning district.
No fence or freestanding wall, other than a retaining wall, in a required setback area for a residential zoning district shall be more than six feet in height above finished grade, except as required for screening. (See Section 407).
Section 405. - Required buffers in commercial and industrial districts.
In any commercial or industrial zoning district where a lot abuts any residential district or any adjacent residential use, a 25-foot wide buffer shall be provided with screening as specified in Section 407. Offstreet parking associated with such uses shall be governed by this same provision.
Section 406. - Screening of service areas within 100 feet of public street.
Any service area, loading area, refuse, or storage area between a principal building and a public street being visible from such street and lying within 100 feet of such street shall be provided with screening as specified in Section 407.
Section 407. - Screening required.
Whenever screening is required by this appendix, a durable masonry wall, or fence and hedge of sufficient opacity to provide a visual blind designed to be compatible with the character of adjoining properties, shall be provided. Such fences and/or walls shall be at least six feet in height, but no greater than eight feet in height, measured from the ground along the common lot lines of the adjoining properties. When hedges or natural plantings are used (together with the fence prescribed) to form the required screening, the minimum sufficient opacity shall be deemed to require no less than three feet of plantings and/or hedge in the area immediately adjacent to the fence, measured along the ground surface from the fence to the inside border of such plantings and/or hedge plantings. Hedges of comparable natural plantings shall be of such variety that an average height of at least six feet could be expected by normal growth within no later than two years from the time of planting. The building official shall make determination of the degree of satisfactory completion of required screening according to a common standard; the building official's decisions in each instance may be appealed to the planning and zoning commission.
Section 407A. - Minimum yard setback.
Wherever this appendix requires a minimum setback between a property line and a building line, unless otherwise indicated, this shall mean the required minimum distance between any point on the property line to the nearest point on the corresponding building line, i.e., the minimum front building line shall be at least the required minimum distance from the front property line, the rear building line shall be at least the required minimum distance from the rear property line, etc.
Section 408. - Reserved.
Editor's note— Amd. of April 5, 2005 repealed sections 408, 409 in its entirety. Former section 408 pertained to a building permit requirement and certificates of occupancy, respectively, and derived from Ord. No. 1997-38, adopted Nov. 4, 1997.
Section 409. - Appealing an action of the zoning administrator, building official, or planning and zoning commission.
(a)
If the zoning administrator or building official executes an action which the aggrieved party believes to be contrary to this section, that action may be appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date on which the action by the zoning administrator or building official was taken.
(b)
The planning and zoning commission has jurisdiction for hearing appeals concerning actions of the zoning administrator or building official related to this section. Applications for appeal may be obtained from and submitted to the zoning administrator, who will transmit them to the planning and zoning commission for its consideration.
(c)
When an action of the zoning administrator or building official is appealed, all construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action must be stopped immediately. In certain cases, however, the building official may feel that the stopping of such construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action will cause imminent peril to life or property. Then, the building official may certify to the planning and zoning commission that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the halting of construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action is allowed to continue unless the construction is halted by the planning and zoning commission or a restraining order is granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(d)
When an application for appeal of an action of the zoning administrator or building official is received, the planning and zoning commission will set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least 15 days before the hearing. In addition, the parties to the appeal will be notified of the date of the hearing by the planning and zoning commission by certified mail with return receipt requested. Any person may appear at the hearing, or have a representative attend instead.
(e)
The planning and zoning commission will make a decision concerning the appeal and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the planning and zoning commission (including but not limited to decisions on appeals or variances) may appeal such decision to the county board of commissioners. Such an appeal must be filed in writing with the zoning administrator within 30 days of the date of the decision being appealed. When an application for appeal of a decision of the planning and zoning commission is received, the board of commissioners will set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least 15 days before the hearing. In addition, the parties to the appeal will be notified of the date of the hearing by the board of commissioners by certified mail with return receipt requested. Any person may appear at the hearing, or have a representative attend instead.
(f)
An application for appeal of an action of the zoning administrator or building official may be withdrawn by the applicant as a matter of right until 5:00 p.m. the day prior to the meeting of the planning and zoning commission or the board of commissioners at which such application is scheduled to be heard. Such withdrawal must be in writing and must be received by the zoning administrator by 5:00 p.m. the day before the scheduled meeting.

Editor's note— An amendment adopted Nov. 6, 2007(3), enacted provisions designated as §§ 409—414, and have been treated as superseding the former §§ 410—414, which pertained to similar subject matter and derived from an ordinance adopted April 3, 2001; an ordinance adopted May 1, 2001; an amendment adopted June 4, 2002(1); an amendment adopted Nov. 5, 2002; an amendment adopted Aug. 3, 2004; and an amendment adopted April 5, 2005(3).
Section 410. - Procedures: variances, conditional use and amendments.
(a)
Preapplication conference.
(1)
Preapplication conference: Recommended. Any applicant seeking approval for a proposed zoning action is advised to engage in a preapplication conference. Prior to filing an application, an applicant may meet with the zoning administrator and the county staff development review committee and discuss their intentions with regard to a given application and questions regarding the procedures or substantive requirements of this section. The applicant should bring sufficient information including sketch maps of the site, a description of the existing environmental, topographical and structural features on the site, the proposed project or use, graphics that illustrate the scale, location and design of any buildings or structures to the extent known, and a list of the issues to be discussed at the conference. No matters discussed at said meeting shall be binding on either the applicant or the county.
(2)
Preapplication conference: Mandatory. Any applicant seeking approval for a proposed zoning action involving:
a.
A residential use of more than 50 dwelling units;
b.
A nonresidential use that would generate an additional 500 or more vehicle trips per day as defined by the Institute of Traffic Engineers Trip Generation Manual;
c.
A planned unit development; or
d.
A development of regional impact, is required to engage in a preapplication conference with the zoning administrator and the county staff development review committee at its regularly scheduled monthly meeting or such other meeting as the zoning administrator may determine.
The zoning administrator may waive the preapplication conference requirement in cases where it is clear such a waiver is not detrimental to the applicant or the county.
(b)
Application.
(1)
The developer or owner submitting a request for a variance, conditional use, or an amendment to the official map or text of the zoning ordinance (hereinafter in this section collectively referred to as a "zoning request") must have at least 51 percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning and zoning commission or board of commissioners may also propose a zoning request.
(2)
Application for a zoning request may be made with the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator will take the required information and transmit it to the planning and zoning commission for its consideration. The planning and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing on all variances and shall make the final decision on all variances, unless such decision is appealed to the board of commissioners in accordance with the provisions of section 409. The board of commissioners shall hold a public hearing on all conditional uses and amendments and shall make the final decision on all conditional uses and amendments, after receiving a recommendation on the conditional use or amendment from the planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning commission may at its option hold a public hearing on a conditional use or amendment prior to making its recommendation to the board of commissioners.
(3)
No application is to be accepted from any person in violation of the Bulloch County Code of Ordinances. If an applicant for a zoning request or any other action by the planning and zoning commission is, at the time of such application, determined by the zoning administrator to be in violation of the Bulloch County Code of Ordinances, then the zoning administrator will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant voluntarily removes or changes the cause of the violation and ceases to be in violation. The applicant must notify the zoning administrator that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the zoning administrator as to the violation. When the applicant has ceased to be in violation of the Bulloch County Code of Ordinances, the zoning administrator will then accept the application for a zoning request. A receipt showing that all county ad valorem taxes on the subject property have been paid and that no delinquencies exist must be submitted with all applications for zoning requests. The zoning administrator may waive the requirements of this paragraph when the zoning administrator, in his discretion, determines that the enforcement of these requirements would cause an extraordinary and undue hardship on the applicant, and that the waiver of these requirements will not have a significant negative impact on the safety, benefit or welfare of the public.
(c)
Notification.
(1)
Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least 15 days but not more than 45 days before the hearing. Such notice will state the time, place and purpose of the hearing. If the zoning request is for an amendment to rezone property from one district to another and is initiated by a party other than the board of commissioners, then the notice shall also include the location of the property, the present zoning district of the property, and the proposed zoning district of the property.
(2)
If the zoning request is for a particular parcel or parcels of property and is initiated by a party other than the board of commissioners, the zoning administrator shall post a sign in a conspicuous place on the property at least 15 days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing. The sign should set forth the purpose, date, time, and place of the scheduled public hearing, and the present and proposed zoning districts in case of a rezone.
(3)
The planning and zoning commission shall make its recommendation respecting a requested conditional use or amendment to the board of commissioners within 60 days of the filing of the application. If the planning and zoning commission fails to send its recommendation to the board of commissioners within the aforesaid 60 days, it shall mean that the planning and zoning commission recommends approval of the conditional use or amendment. Provided, however, that the planning and zoning commission may defer making its recommendation on a conditional use or amendment for more than sixty (60) days with the consent of applicant. After receipt of the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, the board of commissioners shall conduct a public hearing on the proposed conditional use or amendment.

Editor's note— An amendment adopted Nov. 6, 2007(3), enacted provisions designated as §§ 409—414, and have been treated as superseding the former §§ 410—414, which pertained to similar subject matter and derived from an ordinance adopted April 3, 2001; an ordinance adopted May 1, 2001; an amendment adopted June 4, 2002(1); an amendment adopted Nov. 5, 2002; an amendment adopted Aug. 3, 2004; and an amendment adopted April 5, 2005(3).
Section 411. - Variances.
(a)
A variance is a permit, issued by the planning and zoning commission, which allows construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a way that varies from requirements for the district in which the property is located. A variance may be granted only in an individual case where unnecessary or undue hardship would result if all of the requirements of this section were applied stringently to a particular piece of property. Unnecessary or undue hardship means that owing to conditions peculiar to the property and not as a result of any action on the part of the property owner, a permitted use of a lot is not reasonable if all of the requirements of this section are to be met.
(b)
A hardship may exist for medical reasons which would permit the temporary placement of a manufactured home, meeting applicable development standards, on the same parcel as the original principal dwelling. Such temporary dwelling shall be placed behind and within 300 feet of the principal dwelling whenever possible. Such temporary dwelling shall provide living quarters for an infirmed family member or provide living quarters for a family member or certified/registered assisted living employee to aid in the care of one or more infirmed family members living in the original principal dwelling. Variances approved for medical hardship cases shall be reviewed annually by the zoning administrator. When the medical hardship ceases to exist, the owner of the principal dwelling shall notify the zoning administrator. Such manufactured home shall be removed within 30 days, or subject the owner of the principal dwelling to fines and penalties as outlined in section 418.
(c)
With the exception of a medical hardship variance, a variance may be granted only for permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property in question is located. (For example, a two-family dwelling would not be allowed to be placed in an R-15 district under a variance).
(d)
Where a variance is granted for a construction activity requiring a building permit, the building permit must be obtained within 12 months of the issuance of the variance. Otherwise, the variance expires after 12 months.
(e)
The planning and zoning commission will consider the following standards in arriving at a decision on the variance:
(1)
Will the variance cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes of this section?
(2)
Is the spirit of this section observed and the public safety and welfare secured?
(3)
Is the hardship related to conditions peculiar to the property and not a result of any action of the property owner?
(f)
The zoning administrator shall have the power to grant administrative variances from the development standards of this section where, in the opinion of the zoning administrator, the intent of the ordinance can be achieved and equal performance obtained by granting a variance. The authority to grant such variances shall be limited to variances from the following requirements:
(1)
Front yard or yard adjacent to public street setback: variance not to exceed 20 percent of the setback in the applicable zoning district.
(2)
Side yard setback: variance not to exceed 20 percent of the setback in the applicable zoning district.
(3)
Rear yard setback: variance not to exceed 20 percent of the setback in the applicable zoning district.
(4)
Height of building: variance not to exceed 20 percent of the setback in the applicable zoning district.
(5)
Extension of variance or conditional use for a construction activity requiring a building permit: variance to grant a maximum of two one-year extensions of the time limits in subsections 411(d) and 413(d) if the variance or conditional use is for a project requiring multiple building permits and at least one of the permits has been obtained and construction has begun under that permit.
(6)
Parking spaces: variance not to exceed ten percent of required in applicable zoning district.
(7)
Lot size: variance not to exceed five percent of the lot size in the applicable zoning district (minor subdivisions only - as determined by the subdivision ordinance).
(8)
Lot width: variance not to exceed ten percent of the lot width in the applicable zoning district (minor subdivisions only - as determined by the subdivision ordinance).
(9)
Minor amendments to conditions of approval established by the planning and zoning commission.

Editor's note— An amendment adopted Nov. 6, 2007(3), enacted provisions designated as §§ 409—414, and have been treated as superseding the former §§ 410—414, which pertained to similar subject matter and derived from an ordinance adopted April 3, 2001; an ordinance adopted May 1, 2001; an amendment adopted June 4, 2002(1); an amendment adopted Nov. 5, 2002; an amendment adopted Aug. 3, 2004; and an amendment adopted April 5, 2005(3).
Section 412. - Developments of regional impact (DRI).
(a)
Local zoning provision to allow for DRI review: For new developments proposed within the county which meet or exceed the minimum threshold identified in the Department of Community Affair's Procedures and Guidelines for the review of Developments of Regional Impact (DRI), the county will comply with these intergovernmental review procedures. The county shall be allowed up to a maximum of 30 days to complete the review process for large development projects that are likely to create impacts in other local jurisdictions. The county will not take any official action to further any such developments until the DRI review process is completed or a maximum of 30 days has transpired from the date the completed DRI request for review form was forwarded to the regional development center.

Section 413. - Conditional use.
(a)
Some zoning districts permit certain uses only upon approval of the board of commissioners after receiving a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission. These uses are identified in this section as conditional uses and such uses are allowed only under the circumstances specified in this section.
(b)
An applicant requesting a conditional use shall provide the zoning administrator any information as may be deemed appropriate to assist in the consideration of the request (e.g., sketch plan).
(c)
The planning and zoning commission and board of commissioners will consider the following standards in arriving at a decision on the conditional use:
(1)
Is the type of street providing access to the use adequate to serve the proposed conditional use?
(2)
Is access into and out of the property adequate to provide for traffic and pedestrian safety, the anticipated volume of traffic flow, and access by emergency vehicles?
(3)
Are public facilities such as schools, EMS, sheriff and fire protection adequate to serve the conditional use?
(4)
Are refuse, service, parking and loading areas on the property located or screened to protect other properties in the area from such adverse effects as noise, light, glare or odor?
(5)
Will the hours and manner of operation of the conditional use have no adverse effects on other properties in the area?
(6)
Will the height, size, or location of the buildings or other structures on the property be compatible with the height, size or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties?
(7)
Is the proposed conditional use consistent with the purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance?
(d)
If the zoning administrator finds that any restrictions upon which a conditional use was granted are not being complied with, he/she may suspend the permit for the conditional use until such time as the applicant brings the conditional use into compliance with the restrictions imposed by the board of commissioners. Only work upon the conditional use may be allowed during suspension of the permit which is necessary to bring the conditional use into compliance with the restrictions imposed by the board of commissioners.
(e)
Where a conditional use is granted for a construction activity requiring a building permit, the building permit must be obtained within 12 months of the issuance of the conditional use. Otherwise, the conditional use expires after 12 months.

Section 414. - Amendments.
(a)
Any land owner may request that the official map be amended from the existing zoning district to another as it applies to the owner's property. Also, any person affected by this zoning ordinance may propose an amendment to the text of this zoning ordinance under the provisions of this section. As used in this section, the term "amendment" shall mean both a change to the official map and a change to the text of this section unless otherwise indicated.
(b)
An applicant requesting an amendment to the official map shall provide the zoning administrator the following:

(2)
A copy of the recorded plat and legal description will be the minimum requirement for the planning and zoning commission.
(3)
Where the zoning administrator or the county staff development review committee has recommended the preparation of special studies pursuant to a preapplication conference or where the applicant elects to submit additional technical reports in support of the proposed development, such reports shall be submitted with the initial application form.
(4)
During review of any application, the planning and zoning commission may determine that additional specific technical information is needed regarding any potential environmental, fiscal, or public service impacts. If such a determination is made, the planning and zoning commission shall have the discretion to defer its recommendations concerning such an application upon preparation of a special study intended to analyze the potential impacts or any specific areas of concern.
(5)
Where preparation of a special study has been required, no application shall be recommended to be submitted to the board of commissioners for a public hearing until such study has been received and reviewed by the planning and zoning commission.

(6)
Any other materials or information as may be deemed appropriate by the zoning administrator.
(c)
When considering a proposal to amend the official map, the following standards shall be considered:
