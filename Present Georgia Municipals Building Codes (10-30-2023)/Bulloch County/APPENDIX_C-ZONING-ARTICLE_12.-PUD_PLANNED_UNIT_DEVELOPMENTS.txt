--- (8) ---
Editor's note— An amendment adopted Nov. 6, 2007(3), enacted provisions designated as §§ 1201—1213, and have been treated as superseding §§ 1201—1205, which pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1997-40, adopted Dec. 2, 1997; an amendment adopted April 5, 2005(3); and an amendment adopted Oct. 3, 2006.

Section 1201. - Purpose.
A planned unit development (PUD) is a type of land use planning option that is intended to provide a more flexible approach to permitting unified developments on a larger scale and to encourage the best possible site plans and building arrangements. It is the purpose of the PUD district to encourage the development of compatible land uses within the framework of a master development plan for residential and nonresidential land uses within an environmentally compatible setting. In addition to the natural environment, such developments take into consideration different architectural styles, relative scales of various structures, the network efficiency of streets and utilities, and the larger community setting, and the goals and objectives of the Bulloch County Comprehensive Plan.

(Amd. of 11-6-07(3))
Section 1204. - Types of PUD districts permitted.
(a)
Planned residential development (PUD-1): This is a planned development concept that concentrates buildings in specific areas on a site to allow the remaining land to be used for recreation, common open space, and the preservation of environmentally sensitive areas.

The application for approval of a PUD master development plan is treated as an application for an amendment to this article (rezoning), and thus shall follow the procedures contained in sections 414 and 2302 of this article. The applicant shall submit with other materials in an application for zoning map amendment the following exhibits:
(1)
A statement of objectives that describes the following:
a.
The general purpose and character of the proposed development including types and uses.
b.
Tables or calculations illustrating conformance with PUD performance development standards.

(b)
The proposed PUD may depart from strict conformance with the requirements of zoning and subdivision requirements to the extent specified in the master development plan and documents authorizing the PUD so long as tangible benefits are provided to the neighborhood or community in which it is located. These benefits shall be in the form of provisions of exceptional amenities, design excellence, etc. The waiver of any requirement shall be the direct cause of accrual of positive benefits to the residents of the development as well as to the general community (e.g., waiver of yard requirements might result in more usable open space). Departure from any requirement specified in this article or other county ordinances and regulations is a privilege, and shall be granted only upon recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and approval by the board of commissioners, as applicable in this article.
(Amd. of 11-6-07(3))
Section 1208. - Final development plan approval.
(a)
If the rezoning approval for the PUD is granted, the applicant shall submit a conceptual site plan for each phase or pod of development, as prescribed in article VIII of the Bulloch County Subdivision Regulations, to the planning and zoning commission.

The planning and zoning commission may approve proposed minor modifications by the applicant to the master development plan during conceptual site plan review provided that such modifications meet any approved zoning conditions or the general intent of development standards of this section or ordinance as a whole. Upon subsequent approval by the planning and zoning commission, subsequent minor changes or deviations from the approved conceptual site plan which do not affect the intent or character of the development shall be reviewed by the planning director. Minor changes may include, but are not limited to:
(1)
Change in alignment, location direction, or length of a local street.
(2)
Adjustments, shifts or transfer, not resulting in increased overall density or land use intensity.
(3)
Reorientation or slight shifts in building locations.
(c)
