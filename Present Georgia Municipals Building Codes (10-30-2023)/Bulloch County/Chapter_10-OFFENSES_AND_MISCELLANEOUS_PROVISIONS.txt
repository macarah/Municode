Any such appeal shall toll the 30-day period, or any extension thereof, required by subsection 10-122(c) of this article. If the magistrate court rules in favor of the person or firm against whom the claim was made, the county shall have no right to recover any proceeds of the bond or letter of credit, and judgment shall be entered against the county.

The portion of any judgment entered in favor of the county that exceeds the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be subject to collection by any additional remedies at law or equity.

(a)
It is declared to be the public policy and purpose of the county board of commissioners to utilize its police powers to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of this county.

Accordingly, the board of commissioners finds that this article is necessary for the immediate preservation of the peace, health, safety, welfare, and prosperity of the citizens of Bulloch County. However, nothing in this article is intended to deter individuals from lawfully exercising the individual right to freedom of speech or any other freedom guaranteed under the Constitutions of the United States of America or of the State of Georgia.
