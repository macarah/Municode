Sec. 12-201. - Declaration of policy and purpose.
The purpose of this division is to provide citizens of the county with a procedure for the paving and/or improvement and public dedication of private roads in the unincorporated areas of the county. To that end, this division is adopted in order to effect the creation of road tax districts to pay for such paving and/or improvement.
(Amd. of 10-19-10)
Sec. 12-202. - Definitions.
Property owner. The term "property owner" as used in this division shall include all persons, and their successors and assigns, holding fee simple title according to the real estate records of the county within a proposed road tax district at the time the petition for the creation of said district is submitted as provided herein. For the purpose of petitioning of the board of commissioners for the creation of a new road tax district, the property owners shall have one vote per platted lot within a particular proposed road tax district. The term "property owner" specifically excludes tenants in possession of property within the road tax district.
Road tax district. The term "road tax district" is a specific type of special tax district within the county. Special tax districts are authorized pursuant to article 9, section 2, paragraph VI of the Constitution of the State of Georgia. Road tax districts may be created for property owners to amortize the cost of paving and/or improving a road or roads within the district.
(Amd. of 10-19-10)
Sec. 12-203. - Road tax districts created; register; responsibility for costs.
(a)
New special tax districts which shall be known as road tax districts may be created upon the submission of a proper petition and a resolution of the board of commissioners. Each new road tax district so created shall be assigned a number and be designated by recorded plats showing each lot therein.
(b)
A register of road tax districts shall be maintained in the office of the county manager or his designee and the office of the county tax commissioner. Such registers shall be available to the public for inspection upon reasonable notice to either of these offices.
(c)
The cost of paving and/or improving the road or roads shall be advanced by the county. The county shall have the authority to contract with the necessary parties to complete the job. The cost of paving and/or improving the road or roads (including, but not limited to, any necessary legal, engineering, or survey work) shall then be paid by the property owners of the road tax district and amortized over a period of time that includes no more than five successive annual ad valorem real property tax bills, and shall bear interest at a rate of prime plus one percent per annum. The pro-rata amortized cost of the paving and/or improvement shall be assigned to each platted lot within the road tax district. The road tax district shall end upon payment of the amortized cost to the county.
(d)
An administrative fee of $25.00 per lot shall be charged by the county to cover administrative costs of a road tax district; provided, however, that the total administrative fee shall be not less than $100.00 nor more than $500.00 for any road tax district.

Sec. 12-204. - Collection and responsibility for administration.
(a)

The date for determining ownership of each lot shall be January 1 of each year. Any proration of such charges between owners of lots to which title is transferred during any year shall be the responsibility of the buyers and sellers of such lots.
(b)
The office of the tax commissioner of the county shall be responsible for the timely collection of taxes, fees, and assessments assessed to each road tax district and shall remit such sums to the board of commissioners in the same manner as other taxes are remitted.

(Amd. of 10-19-10)
Sec. 12-206. - Deposit and forfeiture.
In addition to the charges authorized in this division, the county may require deposits from the property owners within the road tax district in any or all such road tax districts created hereunder in an amount not to exceed one year's prorated cost for the pavement and/or improvement of the road or roads. This deposit shall be held by the county as security for payment for services rendered pursuant to this ordinance, and the county shall have the authority to setoff against the deposit for nonpayment for services at such times and on such occasions as shall be determined by the county. Notice of setoff shall be given to the property owner by mail at the address of the property, although advance notice of such setoff shall not be required. In the event of a reduction in the deposit of a property owner because of failure to pay charges assessed pursuant to this ordinance, the property owner shall be required to restore the deposit to its required level upon request by the county. Any required deposit as contemplated herein shall be retained by the county so long as the road tax district is in existence. Any deposit remaining in the last year of the road tax district shall be applied by the county to the remaining indebtedness with any excess refunded to the then-current property owner.

Sec. 12-207. - Creation of road tax districts; constructive knowledge of this division and the road tax districts created pursuant to this division.
(a)
Any property owner in the unincorporated area of the county whose lot has access on a private road may present a request for the creation of a road tax district to the county manager or his or her designee. The request shall designate the boundaries for a road tax district which shall serve the property owner presenting the request and other property owners within the geographical area. The request shall include a plat or plats showing the proposed road tax district. The office of the county manager shall then provide a petition to be circulated by the presenter of the request among the property owners in the proposed district. At least 75 percent of the property owners within the proposed district must sign the petition for the petition to be presented to the board of commissioners. If the proposed road tax district encompasses more than one subdivision as shown by plats filed in the public land records of the county, 75 percent of the property owners within the proposed road tax district in each and all of the included subdivisions must sign the petition. Unless 100 percent of the property owners have signed the petition, a public hearing shall be held by the board of commissioners after having advertised one time in the official legal organ of the county, and a sign or signs shall be posted in the proposed road tax district giving notice of the hearing, at least ten days before the public hearing.
(b)
By signing the petition for the creation of a new road tax district, all petitioners within a proposed road tax district shall be deemed to have actual or constructive notice of this division and all the provisions contained herein as well as the request and petition for a road tax district.
(c)
All successors in interest to the property owners within a certain district at the time of the creation of said road tax district shall be deemed to have constructive notice of this division and the existing road tax district or request wherein the lot is located due to the existence of public records containing such information.
(d)
Upon receipt of a petition as provided herein and after a public hearing, if one is required, the board of commissioners shall take under consideration the establishment of the requested road tax district. The board of commissioners, in its sole discretion, may vote to create one or more of such districts based upon all of the evidence presented to the board of commissioners. Nothing contained herein shall create any right by any property owner or owners to the creation of such districts. The creation of one or more such districts shall not generate a precedent or obligation on the board of commissioners to approve future requests for a road tax district; rather, each proposed district shall be considered based on the totality of the evidence regarding each respective district. The decision of the board of commissioners, in the exercise of its discretion, shall be final.
(e)
The decision of the board of commissioners to create a special road tax district shall be evidenced by resolution adopted at a regular or special meeting of the board of commissioners.
