Editor's note— Amd. of April 5, 2005(3) repealed article 6, sections 601—604, in its entirety and replaced it with a new article 6, sections 601—606.

Section 601. - Purpose.
R-80 Single-family residential (minimum lot size—80,000 square feet). R-80 zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve quiet, relatively low-density neighborhoods of single-family residences as desired by large number of people. These districts are free from uses which are incompatible with single-family homes.
R-40 Single-family residential (minimum lot size—40,000 square feet). R-40 zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve quiet, relatively low-density neighborhoods of single-family residences as desired by large number of people. These districts are free from uses which are incompatible with single-family homes.
R-25 Single-family residential (minimum lot size—25,000 square feet). R-25 zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve quiet, relatively low-density neighborhoods of single-family residences as desired by large number of people. These districts are free from uses which are incompatible with single-family homes.
R-15 Single-family residential (minimum lot size—15,000 square feet). R-15 zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve quiet, relatively low-density neighborhoods of single-family residences as desired by large number of people. These districts are free from uses which are incompatible with single-family homes.
R-2 Two-family residential (minimum lot size—15,000 square feet). R-2 zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve quiet, relatively low-to-medium density neighborhoods of single-family and/or two-family residences. These districts are free from other uses which are incompatible with single-family homes.
R-3 Multiple-family residential (minimum lot size—15,000 square feet). R-3 zoning districts are intended to:
(1)
Encourage the development of land as planned neighborhoods or communities;
(2)
Preserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging scenic and functional open areas within residential areas;
(3)
Provide for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets as well as lower development and housing costs; and
(4)
Provide an environment of stable character which is compatible with surrounding residential areas.

7 No principal building may be erected on any lot which has less than the minimum street footage of immediate frontage on at least one public street. For purposes of this provision, the term "frontage" includes the width of an easement to a public street from otherwise land locked property.
(1)
Conversion of dwellings: The conversion of any building into a dwelling, or the conversion of any dwelling so as to accommodate an increased number of dwelling units or families, shall be permitted only within a district in which a new building for similar occupancy would be permitted under this ordinance, and only when the resulting occupancy will comply with the requirements governing new construction in such district with respect to minimum lot size, lot area per dwelling unit, percentage of lot coverage, dimensions of yards and other open spaces. Not applicable in R2 and R3 zoning districts.
(2)
Applicability to land and buildings: No building, structure or land may be used or occupied—and no building or structure or part of a building or structure may be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered—unless in conformity with all of the regulations specified for the district in which it is located.
(3)
Every use must be on a lot: No building or structure may be erected or use established unless upon a lot as defined by this ordinance.
(4)
Only one principal building per lot: Only one principal building and its accessory buildings may be erected on any lot, except for planned developments or as otherwise provided. Not applicable in the R3 zoning district.
(5)
Open space not to be encroached upon: No open space may be encroached upon or reduced in any manner except in conformity with the yard, setback, off-street parking spaces, and other such required development standards contained in the ordinance. Shrubbery, driveways, retaining walls, fences, curbs, and buffers (see definition in article 2) are not considered to be encroachments of yards. Open space areas as required by this ordinance must be permanently maintained as open space in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance.
(6)
Reduction of yards or lot area: Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, a lot existing at the time of the original passage of this ordinance (November 4, 1994) may not be reduced, divided, or changed so as to produce a tract of land which does not comply with the minimum dimension or area requirements of this ordinance for the district in which it is located unless that reduction or division is necessary to provide land which is needed and accepted for public use.
(7)
Yards and other spaces: No part of a yard, other open space, off-street parking, or loading space required for another building may be included as a part of the yard, off-street parking, or loading space required for another building, except as specifically provided for in this ordinance.
(8)
Substandard lots: When a lot has an area or frontage which does not conform with the requirements of the district in which it is located, but was a lot of record at the original effective date of this ordinance (November 4, 1994), such a lot may be used for any use allowed in the zoning district in which it is located as long as all other requirements of this ordinance are met. Not applicable in the R3 zoning district.
