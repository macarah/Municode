a.
The person or business submitting the lowest bid that has been deemed responsive and responsible shall be deemed the lowest qualified bidder. If, however, the lowest qualified bidder is not a Cherokee County-based business, any Cherokee County-based business with a bid within five percent of the lowest dollar bid that has been deemed responsive and responsible in all respects to the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids/proposals shall be deemed the lowest qualified bidder if it agrees to reduce its bid price to match the bid price of the lowest price bidder. The percentage difference may be revised from time to time as the board of commissioners deems appropriate.
b.
If a Cherokee County-based business that has been deemed responsive and responsible refuses to reduce its price bid to match the lowest price bidder, then the next lowest responsible Cherokee County-based business with a bid within the established percentage of the lowest bid shall be given the opportunity to reduce its bid to match the bid of the lowest bidder. If the Cherokee County-based bidder deemed responsive and responsible agrees to reduce its bid to match the bid of the lowest non-Cherokee County bidder, it will be deemed the lowest bidder and awarded the bid.
c.
If no responsive and responsible Cherokee County-based business within the established percentage of the lowest bid agrees to reduce its bid to that of the lowest bidder, then the contract shall be awarded to the person or business with the lowest, most responsive and responsible bid.

(Ord. of 4-19-16(1), § 2-5-3.01; Ord. No. 2022-O-004 , § 2-5-3.01, 2-1-22)
Sec. 2-122. - Competitive sealed bidding.
(a)
Conditions for use. All contracts of the county shall be awarded by competitive sealed bidding, except as otherwise provided in this article, or as provided by general law.
(b)
Invitation for bids. An invitation for bids shall be issued for the procurement of each contract and shall include specifications and all contractual terms and conditions applicable for the procurement.

Public notice For all purchases exceeding $100,000.00, except as otherwise provided in this article, advertisements for formal sealed bids shall first be posted on the county website for two consecutive weeks prior to the week of bid opening as well as posted on the Georgia Procurement Registry pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-80-26. Regular bid openings shall be conducted by the purchasing agent or his/her designee at the offices of the purchasing department or other designated location. Immediately after opening all bids, the purchasing agent or his/her designee shall record and certify each and every bid. The date, time and place of bid opening shall be included in the specifications or invitations to bid and in the published advertisement therefore.
(d)
Bid acceptance and bid evaluation. Bids shall be accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this article. Bids in the county's possession may be withdrawn: 1) prior to official opening; or 2) prior to award, upon approval of the county manager or the purchasing agent, where errors are identified, provided that such request is made in writing from an appropriately authorized agent of the bidder. Bids shall be evaluated, except as otherwise provided in this article, based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery and suitability for a particular purpose. Those criteria that will affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs and total or life cycle costs. The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used.
(e)
Award. The contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids; provided, however, that if the bid from the lowest responsible and responsive bidder exceeds the funds budgeted for the contract, the county may negotiate with such apparent low bidder to obtain a contact price within the budgeted amount. Such negotiations may include changes in the scope of work and other bid requirements. In the event that two or more bids are determined to be identical in price or otherwise of clearly equal merit, the county manager shall determine which of such bids shall be selected.
(f)
Acceptance of low bid not required. The award of a contract to a prospective contractor or person based on lowest evaluated bid price alone can be a false economy if there is subsequent default, late deliveries, or other unsatisfactory performance resulting in additional contractual or administrative costs. While it is important that county purchases and contracts be made at the lowest possible bid price, this does not require an award to a prospective contractor or person solely because that prospective contractor or person submits the lowest bid. A prospective contractor or person must affirmatively demonstrate his, her or its responsibility. In evaluating the responsibility of a prospective contractor or person submitting a bid or whether the bid has been submitted by the "lowest responsible and responsive bidder", the purchasing agent or his/her designee shall have the discretion to evaluate factors that may include, but are not limited to: a) the past contracting history, performance and experience with the county or any county authority, county office or county agency of the prospective contractor or person, or any identified subcontractor of the prospective contractor or person; b) whether that prospective contractor or person, or any identified subcontractor of the prospective contractor or person, is currently on the State of Georgia's suspended or debarred suppliers list, the federal government's list of any debarred, suspended or ineligible contractors and/or any list of suspended, debarred or ineligible contractors maintained by another governmental entity including any other local government; and/or c) whether the prospective contractor or person, or any identified subcontractor of the prospective contractor or person, has sufficient experience, financial ability or credit, judgment, reliability, integrity, trustworthiness, facilities, equipment, perseverance and skill which will assure good faith performance.
(Ord. of 4-19-16(1), § 2-5-3.02; Ord. No. 2018-O-005, § 1, 6-19-18; Ord. No. 2022-O-004 , § 2-5-3.02, 2-1-22)
Sec. 2-123. - Competitive sealed proposals.
(a)
Conditions for use. When the purchasing agent determines that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the county, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposals method.
(b)
Request for proposals. Proposals shall be solicited through a request for proposals.
(c)
Public notice. Adequate public notice of the request for proposals shall be given in the same manner as provided in section 2-122.(c).
(d)
Receipt of proposals. To the extent allowed by law, no proposals shall be handled so as to permit disclosure of the contents of any proposals to competing offerors received in response to a solicitation or during the process of negotiation. The purchasing agent may request from bidders such clarifications and/or minor modifications regarding their proposals as may be necessary to ensure compliance with this article. Subsequent to award, a proposal summary, which shall include a register of proposals, shall be prepared containing the name of each offeror, the number of modifications received, if any, and a description sufficient to identify the item offered. The register of proposals shall be open for public inspection, except as otherwise allowed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 50-18-72(a)(10).
(e)
Evaluation factors. The request for proposals shall state the relative importance of price and other evaluation factors. The purchasing agent or county manager shall preapprove any bid that considers the relative importance of price in the source selection process to be less than 50 percent.
(f)
Discussion with responsible offerors and revisions to proposals. Discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and conformance to, the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be provided equal opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals, and such revisions may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining updated offers.
(g)
Once updated offers have been obtained from all offerors reasonably susceptible of being selected for award, they shall be rescored. The updated scores shall result in a determination as to which suppliers are considered responsive and responsible and qualified to perform the work and a ranking shall be prepared in order of qualifications based upon the scoring values.
(h)
The top ranked offeror's price(s) for goods and/or services shall be evaluated by the purchasing agent or county manager as to the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed price and regarding the value provided to the county. If such evaluation reveals that the pricing of the highest ranked offeror is not fair and reasonable, the purchasing agent shall initiate negotiations with the top ranked offeror. Should these negotiations fail to result in an acceptable price for the county, the purchasing agent shall formally terminate these negotiations. Should the second and third highest ranked offerors be considered qualified and acceptable, then the purchasing agent shall make a determination regarding their price reasonableness and negotiate as necessary with one supplier at a time in the ranked order until either an acceptable price is obtained or negotiations are formally terminated. The availability of an approved budget adequate to cover the price of any of the acceptable offeror's prices is not an indication of a fair and reasonable price. For the purposes of this article, a determination of a "fair and reasonable" price shall occur before the purchasing agent may award contracts or place orders, with any exceptions to this requirement to be approved by the county manager or board of commissioners.
(i)
Award. The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the responsible and responsive offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the county. This determination shall take into consideration both the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals and the determination that the contracted price is fair and reasonable.
(j)
Acceptance of low proposal not required. The award of a contract to a prospective contractor, person or entity based on lowest evaluated proposal price alone can be a false economy if there is subsequent default, late deliveries, or other unsatisfactory performance resulting in additional contractual or administrative costs. While it is important that county purchases and contracts be made at the lowest possible purchase price, this does not require an award to a prospective contractor, person or entity solely because that prospective contractor, person or entity submits the lowest proposal. A prospective contractor, person or entity must affirmatively demonstrate his, her or its responsibility. In evaluating the responsibility of a prospective contractor, person or entity submitting a proposal or whether the proposal has been submitted by the "lowest responsible and responsive bidder", the purchasing agent or his/her designee shall have the discretion to evaluate factors that may include, but are not limited to: a) the past contracting history, performance and experience with the county or any county authority, county office or county agency of the prospective contractor or person, or any identified subcontractor of the prospective contractor or person; b) whether that prospective contractor or person, or any identified subcontractor of the prospective contractor or person, is currently on the State of Georgia's suspended or debarred suppliers list, the federal government's list of any debarred, suspended or ineligible contractors and/or any list of suspended, debarred or ineligible contractors maintained by another governmental entity including any other local government; and/or c) whether the prospective contractor or person, or any identified subcontractor of the prospective contractor or person, has sufficient experience, financial ability or credit, judgment, reliability, integrity, trustworthiness, facilities, equipment, perseverance and skill which will assure good faith performance.

The request for proposals shall describe the services required, list the types of information and data required of each offeror, and state the relative importance of particular qualifications.
(c)
Statement of qualifications. When seeking proposals for professional services, the purchasing agent shall develop a uniform format for statements of qualifications to be made a part of the proposal.

Businesses may amend these statements at any time by filing a new statement.
(d)
Discussions. The head of a using department procuring the professional services or a designee of such officer may conduct discussions with any offeror who has submitted a proposal to determine such offeror's qualifications for further consideration. Discussions shall not disclose any information derived from proposals submitted by other offerors, to the extent allowed by law.
(e)
Award. Award shall be made to the offeror determined by the Board of commissioners or its designee to be best qualified, based on the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals, and where the negotiated compensation is determined to be fair and reasonable. If compensation cannot be agreed upon with the best qualified offeror, then negotiations will be formally terminated with the selected offeror. If proposals were submitted by one or more other offerors determined to be qualified, negotiations may be conducted with such other offeror or offerors, in the order of the respective qualification ranking, and the contract may be awarded to the offeror then ranked best qualified if the negotiated amount of compensation is determined to be fair and reasonable.

Any multiple source awards shall be made in accordance with the provisions of other sections as applicable. Multiple source awards shall not be made when a single award will meet the county's needs without sacrifice of economy or service. Multiple source awards shall not be made for the purpose of dividing the business, making available product or supplier selection to allow for user preference unrelated to utility or economy, or avoiding the resolution of tie bids. Any such awards shall be limited to the least number of suppliers necessary to meet the valid requirements.
(3)
Intent to use. If a multiple source award is anticipated prior to issuing a solicitation, the county shall reserve the right to make such an award, and the criteria for award shall be stated in the solicitation.

The purchasing agent or county manager shall then undertake negotiations with the second most qualified firm submitting a price determined to be fair and reasonable to the county. If no satisfactory contract can be reached, the purchasing agent or county manager shall formally terminate negotiations. The purchasing agent or county manager shall then undertake negotiations with the third most qualified firm submitting a price determined to be fair and reasonable to the county. Should the purchasing agent or county manager be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract at a fair and reasonable price with any of the selected firms, and if the county wishes to continue with the pending solicitation, the selection committee shall select additional firms in order of their competence and qualifications considered in relation to the fairness and reasonableness of their price, and the purchasing agent or county manager shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.

APPENDIX A. - FEDERAL GRANT PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS
1.
General Principles.
I.
Procurement policy.
This Appendix A applies to the procurement of all goods and services funded in part or in whole by federal funds. This appendix does not address the requirements of FTA purchases.
It is the policy of the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners herein referred to as the county to:
i.
Ensure compliance with the Cherokee County Purchasing Ordinance as well as other applicable state and federal purchasing laws;
ii.
Ensure that purchases are made in a cost effective and timely manner;
iv.
Provide equal access to all vendors participating through competitive acquisition of goods and services;
v.
Protect the interests of taxpayers without regard to any undue influence or political pressures; and
vi.
Reasonably utilize the requirements of county's procurement processes in conjunction with the funding source's informal procurement methods to expedite completion of transactions and minimize the associated administrative burden and cost to the county.
II.
Purpose
The purpose of this appendix is to provide specific procurement guidance when the county uses federal funds. This appendix is a supplement to county's procurement ordinance, policies and procedures.
When the procurement transaction involves the expenditure of state or federal funds, the transaction shall be conducted in accordance with applicable and mandatory requirements of the funding entity.
III.
Applicability
The proceeding ordinance requirements and modifications are based on 2 CFR 200.317 through 200.327 and are intended to be used as allowed by general Federal Grants only and not FTA procurements.
2.
Roles, Responsibilities and Delegation of Authority.
I.
Roles, responsibilities and delegation of authority.
The procurement department as a part of the administrative services agency serves as the centralized unit for all county purchasing activities. The finance department, also a part of the administrative services agency, shall approve the account numbers provided by the agency directors to ensure that the funding sources are identified prior to procurement planning. Agency directors shall be responsible for maintaining oversight of the vendor's performance to ensure the terms and conditions of the agreement are met.
II.
Standard of conduct/conflict of interest.
It is the policy of the county to seek the best overall value when procuring goods and services. No preferential treatment may be given to any contractor. The county's code of ethics, contained in section 7 of the Personnel Policy Manual and division 9 Ethics in Public Contracting in the Cherokee County Procurement Ordinance as approved by the board of commissioners shall be consulted for requirements related to personal conflicts of interests, gifts, and violations on county contracts and individuals and firms who do business with the county.
Any violation of these standards may be cause for disciplinary action in accordance with state, and local laws. The county's code of ethics describes penalties and actions for employees, officials and private firms who may be involved in any breach of the code of ethics.
III.
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program.
The county maintains a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program that was developed in compliance with federal policy 49 CFR Part 26. The county will endeavor to implement its DBE program so to ensure federal compliance and to facilitate DBE participation.
3.
General Procurement Practices.
I.
Award to responsible and responsive contractors.
The county's user agencies will assist the procurement department in ensuring that all procurement activities are entered into with responsible and responsive businesses, persons, and contractors. A responsible contractor will be determined based on integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources. Meanwhile, a responsive offer/bid is one that conforms in all material aspects to the requirements of the solicitation at the time of submission.
II.
Review of procurement requests to avoid duplicate or unnecessary purchases.
The county limits the acquisition of federally assisted property and services to the amount it needs to support the delivery of federally funded services. The county will only contract for its current and reasonably expected needs and does not add quantities or options to third party contracts. The applicable agency director shall work with finance to ensures that purchases are consistent with, and supports the current approved budget prior to the commitment of funds.
III.
Organizational conflicts of interests.
A.
An "organizational conflict of interest" means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the county, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage. An organizational conflict of interest occurs when any of the following circumstances arise:
i.
Lack of impartiality or impaired objectivity: When the contractor is unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial and objective assistance or advice to the recipient due to other activities, relationships, contracts, or circumstances. Such an organizational conflict of interest would occur, for example, if the service the contractor is to perform under a contract with the county might involve that contractor in evaluating its own performance or the performance of an affiliate under another county contract.
ii.
Unequal access to information: The contractor has an unfair competitive advantage through obtaining access to nonpublic information during the performance of an earlier contract. Such an organizational conflict of interest would occur, for example, if the contractor's service under a prior contract gave it access to nonpublic, proprietary information of a company competing with it for a subsequent contract. The county is under no obligation to equalize other offerors with an incumbent by providing information in the hands of the incumbent due to prior performance of the requirement.
iii.
Biased ground rules: During the conduct of an earlier procurement, the contractor has established the ground rules for a future procurement by developing specifications, evaluation factors, or similar documents. To ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements without an approved waiver of this requirement.
B.
Prohibition against organizational conflicts of interest: The county procurement director shall analyze each federally funded planned acquisition in order to identify and evaluate potential organizational conflicts of interest as early in the procurement process as possible, and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate potential conflicts before contract award. In any instance in which the county first becomes aware of an organizational conflict of interest after contract award, it shall conduct a review to determine whether the organizational conflict of interest was reasonably foreseeable and should have been identified by the contractor prior to award. In an instance where the county first becomes aware of an organizational conflict of interest after award, the procurement director may in his/her discretion terminate the contract or, if reasonably possible, take appropriate steps to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such organizational conflict of interest.
C.
Identifying and addressing organizational conflicts of interest: The procurement department and designated officials shall analyze every planned federally funded procurement to determine whether there is an opportunity for an actual or apparent conflict of interest. Offerors are required to execute a code of ethics affidavit certifying that no direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the business entity, its affiliates, or its subcontractor exists. Failure to submit the affidavit during the bid or proposal process shall render the bid or proposal non-responsive. In any instance where a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest is identified, the procurement shall be reviewed by the procurement director and legal counsel. The procurement director shall be responsible for ensuring that such organizational conflict of interest is appropriately avoided, neutralized or mitigated. The procurement director shall not act to address an organizational conflicts of interest without concurrence from the legal counsel.
4.
No Restrictions on Full and Open Competition
The county ensures full and open competition in the solicitation of all goods and services. Full and open competition ensures that the county receives the best quality and service for the best value. Some of the situations that are considered to be impermissibly restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
i.
Unnecessary experience requirements;
ii.
Bonding requirements that exceed the requirements described in state or local law or those described in 2 CFR Part 200;
iii.
Improper Prequalification procedures that conflict with the prequalification standards established in Section IX of this manual and in 2 CFR Part 200;
iv.
Retainer contracts which make a noncompetitive award to a person or firm if that award is not for the goods or services specified under the retainer contract;
v.
Specifying in-state or local geographical preferences, or evaluating bids or proposals in light of in-state or local geographical preferences, even if those preferences are imposed by state or local laws or regulation, except as permitted by applicable circulars;
vi.
Supporting or acquiescing in non-competitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies. Questionable practices would include, but not be limited to, submission of identical bid prices for the same products by the same group of firms, or an unnatural pattern of awards that had the cumulative effect of apportioning work among a fixed group of bidders or offerors;
vii.
Non-competitive awards to any person or firm on retainer contracts;
viii.
Excessively specific qualifications or evaluation criteria which favor a particular contractor;
ix.
Splitting larger procurements into multiple smaller procurements to evade competition requirements at certain ordering thresholds;
x.
The specification of only a brand name product without listing its salient characteristics and not allowing "an equal" product to be offered; and
xi.
Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
xii.
Prohibiting potential bidders or proposers from being allowed to qualify during the solicitation period, which is from the date the solicitation is issued until the time for the receipt of bids or proposals.
5.
Non-Collusive Bids and Proposals
Each bidder/offeror shall certify in writing that such bidder/offeror has not engaged in any collusive or anti-competitive practices in responding to a solicitation for bids or proposals.
6.

It is not necessary to conduct discussions with responding sources about their bids;
iv.
Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively for the business; and
v.
A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available.
C.
Firm fixed price contracts shall be used when the method of procurement is sealed bidding, except when economic price adjustments may be necessary due to the nature of the commodity being purchased not being conducive to long-term price commitment. Invitation for bids will be publicly advertised, and bids must be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing them sufficient response time prior to the date set for opening the bids.
8.
Competitive Sealed Proposal (Formal Advertising).
A.
The county's procurement selection procedures for competitive sealed proposals are described in this manual. When appropriate, competitive proposals for federally funded procurements should be used when the following circumstances are present:
i.
The property or services to be acquired are described in a performance or functional section;
ii.
Uncertainty exists about whether more than one bid will be submitted in response to an invitation for bids;
iii.
Due to the nature of the procurement, contract award need not be based exclusively on price or price related factors; and
iv.
Separate discussions with individual offeror (s) are expected to be necessary after they have submitted their proposals.
v.
The request for proposals is publicly advertised;
vi.
All evaluation factors/criteria and their relative importance are developed by the user department and specified in the solicitation;
vii.
General and specific evaluation factors are considered by a proposal evaluation team as the evaluation method to determine the most qualified offeror;
viii.
Proposals are solicited from an adequate number of qualified vendors;
ix.
Awards are made to the responsible offeror that provides the highest scoring proposal with price and other factors considered; and
x.
Awards to the offeror whose proposal is in the best interest or provides the best value to the county.
9.
Sole Source and Other Non-Competitive Purchases.
A.
The County's Procurement Ordinance and Administrative Policy PUR-05 Single/Sole Source Procurements provides guidance and an approval process for situations where solicitations may be made from only one source. An amendment to an existing contract that is beyond or out of scope of the original procurement, including any negotiated options, or that increases the contract amount over the small purchase threshold is subject to the requirements of the procurement ordinance. Non-competitive procurements include: sole source, emergency purchases and single response.
B.
A sole source award will be made when the county determines that a particular good or service is only available from one responsible source and this must be justified. A sole source justification must be completed for existing contract changes beyond the scope of the awarded contract.
C.
In addition to the local requirements described in this appendix; a cost analysis will be performed if required by the funding source. A cost analysis may be prepared if the county is unable to determine price reasonableness based on a catalog or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities to other than the Federal Government or price history, if previously determined fair and reasonable. When determining whether there is only one source for the requirement, the county shall consider whether there is a reasonable basis to conclude that:
i.
The requirements cannot be modified to allow a competitive procurement; and
ii.
The existence of ownership or control of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, trade secrets, secret processes, or similar circumstances preclude more than one source for the required goods or services, including construction.
D.
The procurement department will review all single bid or single solicitation responses to determine if competition was adequate. Proposal or bid specifications will be reviewed for undue restrictiveness and potential vendors may be surveyed. An award to single bid or proposal can be made if competition can be determined to be adequate; where a single bid or proposal was caused by external factors beyond the county's control. All efforts of which must be documented and included in the procurement file.
10.
Qualifications-Based Purchases.
A.
Professional services shall be solicited, evaluated, ranked, selected and negotiated in compliance with the qualifications-based section process for architectural and engineering services in accordance with 40 U.S.C. Sections 1101 through 1104, commonly referred to as the Brooks Act.
B.
The county shall publicly announce requirements for engineering and design services and negotiate contracts for these services based on the demonstrated competence and qualifications of prospective contractors to perform the services required at fair and reasonable prices. Procurement may involve a single step process with issuance of a request for proposal (RFP) to all interested contractors or a multiphase process with issuance of a request for statements or letters of interest or qualifications (RFQ) whereby responding contractors are evaluated based on qualifications and request for proposals are then provided to the most highly qualified contractors.
C.
The county's competitive proposal process shall provide all information and requirements necessary for interested consultants to provide a response to the RFP and compete for the solicited services.
i.
Evaluation Factors: The county shall evaluate each potential contractor in terms of its:
•
Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;
•
Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required;
•
Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;
•
Past performance on contracts with the county, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;
•
Proposed or past DBE participation (for responsiveness and responsibility determinations only);
•
Acceptability under other appropriate evaluation criteria and;
•
Price is excluded as an evaluation factor.
ii.
Evaluation, Ranking and Selection: A Technical Evaluation Team (TET) must be convened for the purpose of selecting proposed contractors for the performance of A-E or related services:
•
Proposals shall be evaluated based on the criteria established and published within the public solicitation;
•
While the contract will be with the prime consultant, proposal evaluations shall consider qualifications of the prime and any subcontractors;
•
Following the submission and evaluation of proposals, the TET shall conduct interviews or other types of discussions with the three highest scoring firms to clarify the technical approach, qualifications, and capabilities as provided in the RFP;
•
From the proposal evaluation and any subsequent discussions which have been conducted, the TET shall rank, in order of preference, at least three firms determined most highly qualified to perform the solicited services based on the established and published criteria; and
•
Notification must be provided to responding firms of the final ranking of the three highest scoring firms.
iii.
Negotiation: The final selection authorizes the procurement department to begin negotiations. Negotiations shall be conducted beginning with the most qualified firm in the final selection.
•
If concealed cost proposals were submitted in conjunction with technical/qualifications proposals, only the cost proposal of the firm with which negotiations are initiated may be considered. Concealed cost proposals of firms with which negotiations are not initiated should be returned to the respective organization.
•
If the mutually satisfactory contract with a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated after the procurement department has obtained a written best and final offer, the firm will be notified in writing that negotiations have been terminated. The procurement department shall then initiate negotiations with the next firm on the final selection list. If a satisfactory agreement cannot be reached with the next most qualified firm after the procurement department has obtained a written best and final offer that firm will be notified in writing that negotiations have been termination. Then, if necessary, negotiations with successive firms in descending order of qualifications may be conducted until contract award can be made to the firm whose price the county believes is fair and reasonable; and
•
The county shall retain documentation of negotiation activities and resources used in the analysis of costs to establish elements of the contract in accordance with the provisions set forth in 49 CFR 18.42.
iv.
Small purchases: The simplified procedures as described in this manual may be used in selecting prospective contractors to perform architecture-engineering and related services estimated within the county's simplified threshold of $100,000.00.
v.
The procurement department must conduct a cost analysis of pricing proposals during the negotiations of any contract or modification, but prior to award.
11.
Piggybacking.
A.
Piggybacking is the post-award use of a contract allowing a party who was not contemplated in the original procurement to purchase the goods or services included in the contract at the same prices contained in the contract. Piggybacking is allowed when the solicitation document and contract contain an assignability clause that provides for the assignment of all or part of the specified deliverable(s) or stated minimum or maximum quantities of goods to be purchased as originally advertised, evaluated, and awarded. Piggybacking applies to both the base and option quantities included in a contract. The user agency and the procurement department shall not inflate the order quantities of material or services to facilitate piggybacking by other agencies. When utilizing contact options and assignments to meet federally funded requirements, the procurement department must not negotiate a separate contract based on the terms and conditions of the original.
B.
If the supplies or services were solicited, competed and awarded through the use of an indefinite- delivery - indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract, then both the solicitation and contract award must contain both a minimum and a maximum quantity that represent the reasonably foreseeable needs of the parties to the solicitation and contract.
C.
Where the county obtains these contractual rights through assignment, it may exercise them after first determining the contract price remains fair and reasonable, and all federal requirements have been addressed in the contract's clauses.
12.
State or Local Cooperative Purchasing Contracts.
The county may purchase from a state or local cooperative procurement contracts that were competitively awarded as well as well as being subject to federal requirements, including, but not limited to, full and open competition, no geographic preferences, Buy America, and required clauses and certifications with its purchase orders issued under the state or local contract. State or local government purchasing schedule or purchasing contract means an arrangement that a state or local government has established with multiple vendors in which those vendors agree to provide an option to the state or local government.
13.
Design- Bid- Build & Design-Build Purchase.
Design Bid- Build and Design Build are construction methods that may be used by the county when applicable. Before choosing the construction contracting method to use, a careful assessment must be made of the requirements the project must satisfy and those other characteristics that would be desirable.
A.
The Design Build method gives the contractor maximum control of the design and construction project consistent with the county's needs. This method requires a set of performance specifications including functional criteria, any life-cycle cost considerations, and other evaluation factors. The contractor is selected on the basis of its design proposal, proposed price, and other stated evaluation criteria and the design-build method, a fixed or target price for the project is established at time of contract and the contractor designs and builds the project with its own forces
B.
The Design Bid-Build method requires separate contracts for design services and for construction. For the design services, the qualifications-based procurement procedures must be used. Qualifications-based procurement process and shall not be used for the procurement of the construction. A project using design-bid-build construction proceeds in clearly defined steps which may aid in financing and gaining any necessary approvals as well as aid in managing the entire project. Complex or unique projects can be completely thought through and planned before construction begins. Also before any construction begins, a fixed price for the project can be established.
14.
Protests and Disputes.
I.
Protests.
Protests are addressed in the procurement ordinance division 8. Protest concerning the county's purchasing policies, contract requirements, specifications, the bidding procedure, or the contract award, or any other request for explanation or clarification must be submitted in writing to the attention of the procurement director and must include the following information:
•
The name and address of the protester.
•
The name and telephone number of the protester's contact person having responsibility.

II.
Disputes.
Disputes are addressed in the procurement ordinance, section 2-192. It is the responsibility of the county to settle contract issues and disputes including resolving all contractual and administrative issues arising from third party contractors. The county shall utilize good administrative practices and sound business judgement in resolving contract disputes.
15.
Contract Administration & Record Keeping.
I.

An option is a unilateral right in a contract by which, for a specified time, the county may elect to purchase additional equipment, supplies, or services called for by the contract, or may elect to extend the term of the contract.
17.
Contract Guidance.
I.
Contract type.
The user agency in coordination with the procurement department will select the contract method that will provide a product or service that best meets the county's needs at a reasonable price without undue risks to the contractor and without excessive contract administration costs and contractor claims. The county will apply federal requirements related to all projects for each federally funded contract by type of project and contracting method.
II.
Contract provision.
a.
Maximum length of service and/or supply contracts.
The county will not enter into either service or supply contracts utilizing federal funds with a period of performance exceeding five years, inclusive of options, without prior written approval from the applicable federal agency.
b.
Revenue contracts.
Revenue contracts are contracts whose primary purpose is to generate revenues or to create business opportunities for a county agency.
i.
Competition is not required when a business opportunity (such as running utility cables through tunnels or allowing the installation of transmission towers or antennas on property) is made available on an equal basis to all qualified applicants; and
ii.
The contract file for a revenue contract should include an economic analysis justifying the contract term.
c.
Final payment.
Final payment will be made to the contractor when it has satisfied all of the deliverable requirements called for by all provisions of the contract, including all required documentation. Before making final payment, the county may obtain a signed release from the contractor releasing it from further claims by the contractor.
III.
Remedies for non-conformance.
a.
Liquidated damages.
i.
The user agency and procurement department must consider the potential impact on pricing, competition, costs and difficulties of contract administration, and similar matters before including a liquidated damages clause in contracts. A liquidated damages clause should only be used when:
1.
The time delivery or timely performance is so important that the county may reasonably expect to suffer damages if the delivery or performance is delinquent; and
2.
The extent or amount of damages would be difficult or impossible to ascertain or prove.
ii.
Liquidated damages must be stated clearly in the solicitation. Liquidated damages are not punitive nor are they negative performance incentives. Liquidated damages are used to compensate the county for probable damages. Therefore, the liquidated damages rate must be a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm that is caused by late delivery or untimely performance of the particular contract.
1.
Liquidated damages shall not be fixed without reference to probable actual damages and shall be established on a unit of time and amount basis. The assessment for damages shall be established at a specific rate per day, or another period of time, for each day or other unit of time beyond the contractor's delivery date or performance period. A unit of measurement other than time may be used, if appropriate, such as weight requirements in a rolling stock procurement. The procurement file must include a record of the calculation and rationale for the amount of damages established;
2.
The county may use more than one liquidated damage rate when probable damage to the county is expected to change over the contract period of performance;
3.
The procurement department shall determine a reasonable rate of liquidated damages on a case by case basis, and shall set the rate of liquidated damages based on the recommendations and justifications provided by the user agency initiating the procurement request and the procurement department assessment of all applicable factors;
4.
The user agency in coordination with the procurement department shall document the justification of the rate of liquidated damages in the contract file and shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate these damages; and
5.
A contract may include an overall maximum dollar amount or period of time during which liquidated damages may be assessed, or both, to prevent an unreasonable assessment of liquidated damages.
b.
Termination for default and convenience.
All federally funded contracts exceeding $10,000.00 must contain provisions enabling the county to terminate such contracts for the convenience of the county. These provisions shall specify the manner in which such termination will be effected and the basis for settlement. There shall also be included in such contracts appropriate provisions specifying causes for which the contracts may be terminated for default.
i.
Termination for default: Provides the County with the ability to cancel a contract, either in whole or in part, due to the contractor's failure to perform satisfactorily.
•
If a contractor's right to proceed is terminated for default, the county may take over and complete the work or cause it to be completed, and the contractor and his sureties, if any, shall be liable to the county for any increased costs caused. The contractor and his sureties shall, in addition to increased costs in completing the work, be liable for liquidated damages or for actual damages if liquidated damages are not so provided.
•
If the procurement department determines that the contractor's failure to perform arises from causes which are excusable under the terms of the contract, the procurement department shall not terminate the contractor's right to proceed. Neither shall damages (liquidated or actual) be imposed on the contractor because of any delays occasioned by such causes.
ii.
Termination for convenience: The procurement department may, when the interests of the county so require, terminate a contract, in whole or in part, for the convenience of the county.
•
The procurement department shall give written notice of the termination to the contractor, based on written recommendation from the user agency, specifying the part of the contract terminated and when termination becomes effective.
•
The procurement department will attempt to negotiate a no-cost settlement with the contractor. Otherwise, the contracting officer will negotiate an appropriate settlement agreement with the contractor pursuant to the provisions of the termination for convenience clause of the contract.
c.
Violation or breach.
The county will include contract provisions that include administrative, contractual, or legal remedies for violations or breach of the contact by the third- party contractor for federally funded contracts exceeding $100,000.00 and include in Appendix 2 to part 200 of the FAR.
18.
Performing Independent Cost Estimate, Cost And/Price Analysis.
I.
Independent cost estimate.
An independent cost estimate is especially critical whenever there is no price competition (e.g., for architect-engineer procurements where only one price proposal is received), or where offerors are submitting price proposals for goods or services that are not exactly comparable (e.g., for procurements of high-technology items or professional services). It is also useful in competitive procurements to alert the county when all competitors are submitting unreasonably high cost proposals.
II.
Cost or price analysis.
The user agency will prepare a cost or price analysis in connection with every federally funded procurement action in excess of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, including contract modifications. The method and degree of analysis depends on the facts and circumstances of the procurement, but as a starting point, the recipient must make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. The cost or price analysis serves as a tool to ensure that the county does not pay unreasonably high prices to third party contractors.
A price analysis is the preferred method in determining whether a price is fair and reasonable. The user agency will evaluate prices based on; adequate price competition, prices set by law, established catalog price, comparison to previous purchases or other acceptable methods.
A cost analysis will be conducted when a price analysis is not sufficient in determining whether a price is fair and reasonable. A cost analysis will be performed to compare individual cost elements that make up the total purchase price. The procurement department bid or cost tabulation form may also serve as the cost analysis when applicable. In addition, the user department may seek the technical experience of the county's locally funded engineering contractor in the analysis of hours, quantities, tooling, testing, head counts, and similar factors.
19.
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE).
I.
DBE Program.
The county maintains a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program that was developed in compliance with federal policy 49 CFR Part 26.
The county will make reasonable, race neutral efforts to promote the potential utilization of DBE firms and small business enterprises (SBEs) when utilizing federal funds. The county will engage in procurement practices that support participation of DBE and SBE firms.
II.
DBE liaison officer.
The county has designated a DBE liaison officer who is responsible for developing, implementing and monitoring the DBE program.
III.
Bidder's list.
The DBE liaison officer, with assistance from the procurement department staff, will identify potential DBE firms that may be interested in providing a bid/quote.
IV.
Good Faith Efforts
In accordance with the county's DBE program, the county will continue to maintain a Race-Neutral procurement process.
20.
Prohibited Practices.
The county must comply with the following prohibitions and requirements related to selecting the type of contract or basis for reimbursement for Federally funded procurements.
•
The county must not utilize the "cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost" or "percentage of construction cost" methods of contracting.
•
The county must not utilize the "time and materials" contract unless the county determines that no other contract type is suitable and the contract explicitly specifies a ceiling price that the bidder or offeror may only exceed at its own risk.
•
Where the county chooses to enter a "cost reimbursement" contract, its employees, officers, and agents must comply with the applicable provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Specifically, the county must utilize the guidelines in FAR Part 31 to determine whether the contractor's proposed costs are reasonable, allowable, and allocable.
•
The county must not enter into a tag-on contract without making an acceptable non-competitive procurement finding.
•
Advance payments of federal funds are prohibited unless prior written concurrence is obtained from the federal funding agency.
•
If progress payments are used for a selected contract, such payments must be made on the basis of costs incurred or, for construction contracts only, on the basis of percentage of completion of the relevant project. The county must obtain adequate security (i.e., title to work in progress; letter of credit) for any progress payments made.
•
The county must not contract with parties debarred or suspended as listed on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement as verified at http://www.sam.gov.
•
The county must not specify in state or local geographic preference, except to comply with state licensing requirements or in the case of procuring architectural engineering or disaster relief services.
