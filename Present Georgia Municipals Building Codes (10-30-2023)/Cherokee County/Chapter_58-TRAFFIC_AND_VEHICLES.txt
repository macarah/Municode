Sec. 58-37. - Findings.
The Cherokee County Board of Commissioners finds that residents of certain neighborhoods and certain public streets located within the unincorporated area of Cherokee County desire that motorized carts be allowed to be driven with regular vehicle traffic. The Cherokee County Board of Commissioners, by adoption of this ordinance, shall allow the use of motorized carts within the parameters of state law, but the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners expresses no opinion as to whether the mixture of regular vehicle traffic and motorized carts upon the public streets and rights-of-way are safe. Given the safety concerns of Cherokee County Board of Commissioners, the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners will approve a motorized cart district only upon receiving a request for such motorized cart use via the procedure set forth hereto and subject to the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners' discretion to approve such motorized cart district by a finding that it meets the criteria of this ordinance. The Cherokee County Board of Commissioners, on behalf of itself, agents, employees and representatives of the county, do not waive any right of sovereign immunity or individual qualified immunity. The Cherokee County Board of Commissioners places all citizens and guests on public notice that all drivers or occupants of motorized vehicles, given the disproportionate size of motorized carts in comparison to regular vehicular traffic, do knowingly and voluntarily assume all risks of property damage, injury or death in regard to the operation of any motorized cart. All liability for injury shall be the responsibility of the party causing such injury but in no way shall Cherokee County or any of its employees be liable for any action or inaction with regards to motorized carts authorized pursuant to the article.

Sec. 58-39. - Criteria and procedure for consideration of motorized cart district.
The following section outlines the procedures and criteria to be followed by the applicant(s) and the county in order to obtain motorized cart access on public roads.
(1)
For purposes of this section, a "Motorized Cart District" shall be designated as a clearly defined area that has access to public roads and which has received approval from the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners. In order to be considered for motorized cart use, Motorized Cart Districts shall meet and follow the criteria and procedures listed below.
a.
Where motorized cart access is desired, a petition shall be submitted by the established and legally incorporated homeowner's association for the area where motorized cart access is being requested. For areas where motorized cart access is desired but no homeowner's association exists, a petition may be submitted by the residents of the area, however said petition shall require the signature of at least five separate parcel owners of the proposed Motorized Cart District. The petition must be returned to the county engineer who will verify property ownership (if applicable) using current county tax assessment records and/or proper status of the homeowner's association. The petition submitted shall include statements to confirm the following:
1.
The Motorized Cart District for which motorized cart access is petitioned must have public roads that have a speed limit of 25 miles per hour or less and must have access to public local roads as shown on the county road registry.
2.
Motorized carts may only be operated inside the confines of the roads located in the Motorized Cart District and may not be used on other public roads that have not been approved for use.
3.
Motorized carts are not allowed to travel on sidewalks, swales, trails, multiuse paths, or bicycle paths.
4.
Operators of motorized carts are required to observe all traffic laws as if they were operating any other motor vehicle.
b.
Upon receiving such a petition, the county engineer, or his/her designee, shall verify the area for which motorized cart access has been petitioned and determine whether the area meets the requirements for motorized cart usage. In addition, the county engineer, or his/her designee, shall identify proper locations for signage to be placed to identify the street/area as an authorized location for motorized cart use.
c.
Upon a finding by the county engineer, or his/her designee, that the proposed Motorized Cart District is suitable for use and meets the requirements stated hereto, signs soliciting public comments shall be erected at each entrance to the proposed Motorized Cart District and such signs shall remain in place for at least 30 days. The county engineer, or his/her designee, shall receive and document any and all public comments during this time for consideration by the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners.
d.
After completion of the 30 day period for public comments, the petition and all public comments shall be submitted for consideration to the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners. The Cherokee County Board of Commissioners shall call for a public hearing to be held regarding the petition and such public hearing shall be advertised in the legal organ of Cherokee County at least 15 days but not more than 45 days before the public hearing is to take place.
e.
The Cherokee County Board of Commissioners shall consider the petition, staff recommendations, public comments received, and the results of the public hearing, and approve, deny or modify the petition and the Motorized Cart District boundaries in its sound discretion.
(Ord. No. 2018-O-001, § 1, 1-9-18; Ord. No. 2020-O-001 , § 2, 1-21-20)
Sec. 58-40. - Authorized user.
Any person who possesses a valid motor vehicle driver's license and is at least 16 years of age may operate a motorized cart on the authorized streets and contained in the Motorized Cart District under the same restrictions placed upon such drivers in the operation of motor vehicles on the road of Georgia in compliance with O.C.G.A. tit. 40 and all other applicable state laws regarding the operation of motor vehicles. In addition, any person who possesses a valid motor vehicle instructional permit and is at least 15 years of age may operate a motorized cart in a Motorized Cart District and on authorized streets, so long as such person is accompanied in the front seat by a person who possesses a valid motor vehicle driver's license and is at least 18 years of age. A valid driver's license or instructional permit for the operation of a motor vehicle shall carry the same restrictions for use in a motorized cart authorized pursuant to this article.
(Ord. No. 2018-O-001, § 1, 1-9-18; Ord. No. 2020-O-001 , § 2, 1-21-20)

Head lamps;
(5)
Reflex reflectors;
(6)

(Ord. No. 2018-O-001, § 1, 1-9-18; Ord. No. 2020-O-001 , § 2, 1-21-20)
Sec. 58-42. - Registration of motorized carts.

The application may, among other things, require the following information: owner's name; street address, mailing address, and telephone number; make, model, and identification, and/or serial number of the motorized cart; and such other information as may be reasonably required, as well as a general release statement and/or disclaimer of any liability by the County for accidents involving the registered motorized cart. Two decals shall be issued upon registration; and a record of each motorized cart number, along with the name and address of the owner, shall be maintained by Cherokee County.
(b)
The decals provided upon proper registration must be affixed to the sides or windshield of the motorized cart, or in such a manner as to be fully visible at all times.

The decal issued by Cherokee County shall be non-transferrable from the motorized cart for which it is obtained.
(c)
Only those persons 16 years of age and older may register a motorized cart. Motorized cart registration may be in one person's name only, and the registration form must be signed by that person.
(d)
The fee to register a motorized cart shall be set at $15.00 for a one year registration, $45.00 for a three year registration, or $75.00 for a five year registration. Each registration, regardless of when purchased, shall only be valid for the calendar year(s) and shall expire on December 31.
(e)
Upon occurrence of a sale or transfer of a registered motorized cart to another person, the initial registration shall immediately expire and the new owner of the motorized cart shall be required to register the motorized cart if they wish to operate said cart on authorized streets or within a Motorized Cart District.
(Ord. No. 2018-O-001, § 1, 1-9-18; Ord. No. 2020-O-001 , § 2, 1-21-20)

The speed limit within any school zone as provided for in O.C.G.A. § 40-14-8 and marked pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 40-14-6 may be enforced by using photographically recorded images for violations which occurred only on a school day during the time in which instructional classes are taking place and one hour before such classes are scheduled to begin and for one hour after such classes have concluded when such violations are in excess of ten miles per hour over the speed limit.
( Ord. No. 2020-O-006 , § 1, 9-15-20)
Sec. 58-68. - Administration of use of automated traffic enforcement safety devices.
(a)
The law enforcement agency, or agent on behalf of the law enforcement agency, operating an automated traffic enforcement safety device provided for under O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18 shall maintain a log for the automated traffic enforcement safety device attesting to the performance of such device's self-test at least once every 30 days and the results of such self-test pertaining to the accuracy of the automated traffic enforcement safety device. Such log shall be admissible in any civil enforcement proceeding for a violation issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18. The law enforcement agency, or agent on behalf of the law enforcement agency, operating an automated traffic enforcement safety device shall perform an independent calibration test on the automated traffic enforcement safety device at least once every 12 months. The results of such calibration test shall be admissible in any court proceeding for a violation issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18.
(b)
Prior to the placement of a device within a school zone, each school within whose school zone such automated traffic enforcement safety device is to be placed shall first apply for and secure a permit from the Department of Transportation for the use of such automated traffic enforcement safety device. Such permit shall be awarded based upon need. The Department of Transportation shall promulgate rules and regulations for the implementation of this paragraph.
(c)
If an automated traffic enforcement safety device is moved to or placed in a location where an automated traffic enforcement safety device had not previously been moved to or placed in, no citation shall be issued for a violation recorded by that automated traffic enforcement safety device until:
(1)
The county shall erect signs warning of the use of a stationary speed detection device within the approaching school zone. Such signs shall be at least 24 by 30 inches in area, shall be visible plainly from every lane of traffic, shall be viewable in all traffic conditions, and shall not be placed in such a manner that the view of such sign is subject to being obstructed by any other vehicle on such highway. Such signs shall be placed within 500 feet prior to the warning sign announcing the reduction of the speed limit for the school speed zone. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that such signs are properly installed pursuant to this subsection at the time of any alleged violation under this article; and
(2)
That no citation shall be issued for the first 30 days after the first automated traffic enforcement safety device is introduced by a law enforcement agency within a school zone, but rather, a civil warning shall be issued for disregard or disobedience of the speed limit within the school zone.
(d)
A law enforcement agency authorized to enforce the speed limit of a school zone, or an agent working on behalf of a law enforcement agency or governing body, shall send by first class mail addressed to the owner of the motor vehicle within 30 days after obtaining the name and address of the owner of the motor vehicle but no later than 60 days after the date of the alleged violation:
(1)
A citation for the alleged violation, which shall include the date and time of the violation, the location of the infraction, the maximum speed at which such motor vehicle was traveling in photographically recorded images, the maximum speed applicable within such school zone, the civil warning or the amount of the civil monetary penalty imposed, and the date by which a civil monetary penalty shall be paid;
(2)
An image taken from the photographically recorded images showing the vehicle involved in the infraction;
(3)
A website address where photographically recorded images showing the vehicle involved in the infraction and a duplicate of the information provided for in this paragraph may be viewed;
(4)
A copy of a certificate sworn to or affirmed by a certified peace officer employed by a law enforcement agency authorized to enforce the speed limit of the school zone and stating that, based upon inspection of photographically recorded images, the owner's motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit in the marked school zone and that such disregard or disobedience was not otherwise authorized by law;
(5)
A statement of the inference provided by Georgia law and of the means specified therein by which such inference may be rebutted for such violations;
(6)
Information advising the owner of the motor vehicle of the manner in which liability as alleged in the citation may be contested through an administrative hearing; and
(7)
A warning that the failure to pay the civil monetary penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner as provided for in subsection (d) of this Code section shall waive any right to contest liability.
(e)
Proof that a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit of the marked school zone shall be evidenced by photographically recorded images. A copy of a certificate sworn to or affirmed by a certified peace officer employed by a law enforcement agency and stating that, based upon inspection of photographically recorded images, a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit in the marked school zone and that such disregard or disobedience was not otherwise authorized by law shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts contained therein.
(f)
Liability shall be determined based upon a preponderance of the evidence. Prima-facie evidence that the vehicle described in the citation issued pursuant to this Code section was operated in violation of the speed limit of the school zone, together with proof that the defendant was, at the time of such violation, the registered owner of the vehicle, shall permit the trier of fact in its discretion to infer that such owner of the vehicle was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. Such an inference may be rebutted if the owner of the vehicle:
(1)
Testifies under oath in open court or submits to the court a sworn notarized statement that he or she was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation; or
(2)
Presents to the court a certified copy of a law enforcement report showing that the vehicle had been reported to law enforcement as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violation.
(g)
A violation for which a civil warning or a civil monetary penalty is imposed pursuant to this article shall not be considered a moving traffic violation for the purpose of points assessment under O.C.G.A. § 40-5-57. Such violation shall be deemed noncriminal, and imposition of a civil warning or civil monetary penalty pursuant to this article shall not be deemed a conviction and shall not be made a part of the operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed, nor shall it be used for any insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage.
(h)
Any court having jurisdiction over violations of O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18(a) shall have jurisdiction over cases arising under this Ordinance and shall be authorized to impose the civil monetary penalty provided for by this subsection. Except as otherwise provided pursuant to Georgia law, the provisions of law governing jurisdiction, procedure, defenses, adjudication, appeal, and payment and distribution of penalties otherwise applicable to violations under this Ordinance shall apply to enforcement under this article; provided however, that any appeal from superior or state court shall be by application in the same manner as that provided by O.C.G.A. § 5-6-35
( Ord. No. 2020-O-006 , § 1, 9-15-20)
