ARTICLE VI. - SIGNS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 26-835. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
It is the purpose of the city council in enacting this chapter to provide standards to safeguard life, public health, property and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, erection, maintenance and quality of materials of all signs. More specifically, signs have a powerful impact on the aesthetic environment of the community, and it is the purpose of this article to encourage an aesthetically attractive environment, while allowing sufficient opportunities for communications to serve business and comply with the federal and state constitutions and laws.
(b)
Signs create visual clutter and therefore should be regulated in their size, location, construction and illumination. Signs can detract from the beauty of the neighborhood and lower property values. In seeking to comply with federal and state law, the board has determined that large billboards are, as the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, an aesthetic harm; that the Georgia Supreme Court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of environment; and, that the Eleventh Circuit Court has recognized portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard. These holdings show that the city's ordinance is within the law and therefore constitutional, which is a goal of the city.
(c)
Many signs can also be a hazard and negatively impact traffic safety, by distracting drivers and blocking views of other vehicles and dangers, by making intersections more treacherous, and by making it difficult to see oncoming traffic when entering a roadway. Therefore, it is also the purpose of this article to prevent those harms by regulating signs to safe locations, safe sizes, with proper and safe illumination and construction.
