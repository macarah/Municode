No user shall allow wastewater discharge concentration from any grease interceptor to exceed 325 milligrams per liter, as identified by EPA Method 1664 or 275 milligrams per liter, as identified by EPA Method 413.
(c)
All grease interceptors shall be of a type, design, and capacity approved by the superintendent or his designee and shall be readily and easily accessible for cleaning by the user and city inspection.
(d)
All such grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain minimum design capability or effective volume of the grease interceptor, but not less often than every 30 days. Users who are required to pass water through a grease interceptor shall:
(1)
Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24 minutes at actual peak flow or 12 minutes at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate, as predicted by the uniform plumbing code fixture criteria, between the influent and effluent baffles, with 20 percent of the total volume of the grease interceptor being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate, identified hereafter as a sludge pocket.
(2)
Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required, but at intervals of not longer than 30 days at the user's expense. Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective volume of the grease interceptor.
(3)
Accept the following conditions: If any skimmed or pumped wastes or other materials removed from grease interceptor are treated in any fashion on-site and reintroduced back into the grease interceptor as an activity of and after said on-site treatment, the user shall be responsible for the attainment of the established grease numerical limit described in this subsection (d) on all discharges of wastewater from said grease interceptor into the city sanitary sewer collection and treatment system.
(4)
Operate the grease interceptor in a manner so as to maintain said device such that attainment of the grease limit is consistently achieved. Consistent means any wastewater sample taken from said grease interceptor shall be subject to terms of numerical limit attainment described in this subsection (d).
(5)
Understand and agree that the use of biological additives and automatic grease removal systems as a grease degradation agent is conditionally permissible, upon prior written approval by the health officer or superintendent. Any establishment using this method of grease abatement shall maintain the trap or interceptor in such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the trap's outlet, is consistently achieved.
(6)
Understand and agree that the health officer or superintendent reserves the right to make determinations of grease interceptor adequacy and need, based on review of all relevant information regarding grease interceptor performance, facility site and building plan review and to require repairs to, or modification or replacement of, such traps.
(e)
If an establishment desires, because of documented space constraints, an alternative to an out-of-building grease interceptor, the request for an alternative location shall contain the location of city sewer main and easement in relation to available exterior space outside building and existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for all services at that site.
(f)
The user shall maintain a written record of trap maintenance and retain such record for three years. All such records will be available for inspection by the city at all times.
(g)
No non-grease-laden sources are allowed to be connected to sewer lines intended for grease interceptor service.
(h)
Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24 inches, shall be provided over each grease trap chamber and sanitary tee. The access manholes shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained to prevent water inflow or infiltration. The manholes shall also have readily removable covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal, and wastewater sampling activities.

The written order shall be mailed via certified U.S. mail to the property owner's last known address and additionally a copy of the written order shall be hand-delivered to the subject building or property. If no person is available to accept the order at the building or property, then it shall be posted at the primary entrance to the building or property.
(c)
Failure to comply with any written order duly issued by the health officer or the city pursuant to this article will constitute a separate misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punishable as provided by the laws of the state; provided further that compliance with this article is required notwithstanding the fact that a written order might not have been issued.
(d)
The violation of any provisions of this article, as now existing or as may be hereafter amended, may be enjoined by instituting appropriate proceedings for injunction in the courts of competent jurisdiction in this state. Any public nuisance, which is injurious to the public health, safety, or comfort, may be abated by instituting appropriate proceedings for injunction in the court of competent jurisdiction in this state. Such actions may be maintained notwithstanding the fact that such violation also constitutes a crime, and notwithstanding that other adequate remedies at law exist. Such actions may be instituted in the name of the city.
(e)
Upon the receipt of a notice of violation of this article or an order of the city requiring an act or thing to be done or to cease, the owner or owners of any premises then in question may, in writing, demand a hearing before the city council to present evidence challenging the validity of the city order. The owner may appear in person or by agent with or without an attorney. Said hearing demand must be filed with the city clerk within five days from receipt of the order being challenged. Upon receipt of a proper written demand for a hearing, the city will set a date, time, and place for said hearing to be not less than 30 days from the date of filing said demand. The city's decision at said hearing will be a final decision subject to direct appeal to the county superior court or other court of competent jurisdiction.
(f)
Evidence before the city of any hearing conducted shall be admitted in accordance with the rules of evidence of the superior courts of the state; provided, however, the city may take official notice of any order, rule, regulation, or any other document, record, or entry contained in its official record or minutes for evidentiary purposes.
(g)
For the purposes of this article, the decisions of the city will prevail in any instance in which there is a conflict between it and the health officer on any issue of sewage sanitation, or the lack of it, and its effect on human health or wellbeing.
