That the number of accommodation units allowed shall be proportional to the permitted density of the zone. Each traveler's accommodation unit shall be counted as 0.6 units for the purpose of calculating the permitted number of traveler's accommodations.
5.
All traveler's accommodations shall be within 200 feet of an arterial. Street designations shall be as determined by the Athens-Clarke County Unified Government Comprehensive Plan. Distances shall be measured via a public street or alley access to the site from the arterial.

  1 For the purposes of calculating RM density, unit values are determined by counting the number of bedrooms, as defined in Chapter 9-2, using the following method:
Studio/1 bedroom = 1 unit.
2 bedrooms = 2 units.
3 bedrooms = 3 units.
4 bedrooms = 4 units.
If the result of this calculation yields a fractional unit amount, only the whole number portion of the unit measurement shall be used to determine the total development density.
No more than 25% of the total number of dwellings within a multifamily development shall have four or more bedrooms per dwelling unit.
Lots of record existing prior to December 7, 2010 and proposed lots on subdivision plats submitted for approval prior to December 7, 2010 with calculated density less than three bedrooms shall be eligible to contain a maximum of three bedrooms provided that the lot meets the minimum lot size of 5,000 sq. ft. All other lots existing prior to December 7, 2010 which do not meet the minimum 5,000 sq. ft. lot size shall be eligible to contain a maximum of two bedrooms.
For subdivisions of two or more acres and five lots or more, in lieu of individual lot density calculation, the maximum density allowed for the entire development shall be calculated by multiplying the number of bedroom units allowed per gross acre by the total development acreage.
2 Unless otherwise specified in section 9-15-9.
3 The lot width shall be measured beginning at the front lot line and maintained for the entire depth of the front yard, except for lots entirely adjoining turnaround areas of cul-de-sacs, where the lot width shall be measured at the minimum required front setback line. Preliminary plats for residential subdivisions with ten or more lots may have a maximum of ten percent of such lots exempted from the minimum lot width and continuous linear street frontage requirements through the utilization of private drives and/or narrow lot widths and street frontages.
4 Unless otherwise specified in section 9-15-22.
5 Except for lots entirely fronting turnaround areas of cul-de-sacs, the lot width shall be measured beginning at the front lot line and maintained for the entire minimum lot depth. For lots entirely fronting turnaround areas of cul-de-sacs, the lot width shall be measured beginning at the minimum required front setback line and maintained for the remaining portion of the minimum lot depth.
