Sec. 9-9-1. - Purpose.
This district is composed of certain lands in Athens-Clarke County owned by Athens-Clarke County (including mixed use developments wherein Athens-Clarke County owns the underlying fee simple interest in a parcel and other entities own related air rights or condominium interests), the State of Georgia, the United States, and their instrumentalities, and as such shall be used in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed or established by contract by the government or instrumentality thereof using the same. If Government-zoned or Park-zoned property is sold to a private individual or individuals (or, in the case of such mixed use developments, when Athens-Clarke County no longer owns the underlying fee simple interest or any other interest in a parcel), such property shall be rezoned to a classification that is compatible with the Future Development Map designations of the subject property and/or surrounding area.
