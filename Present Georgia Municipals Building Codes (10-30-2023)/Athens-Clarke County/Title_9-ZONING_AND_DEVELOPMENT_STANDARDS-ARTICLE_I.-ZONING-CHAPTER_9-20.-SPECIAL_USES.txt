Is the proposed use in conformance with all standards within the zoning district in which the use is proposed to be located, and in conformance with relevant comprehensive plan policies implemented by Athens-Clarke County and with all state or federal laws? The governing authority during the special use process may concurrently review related variance requests to waive or reduce zoning and development standards as they pertain to specific building location, height, and size, lot size, and other space limits of the underlying basic district provided that the spirit and intent of such requirements are complied with in the total plan for the special use.
