Personnel administration. The mayor and commission hereby establishes the personnel hearing officer ("PHO"). The PHO shall be an attorney who is a member in good standing of the State Bar of Georgia and is appointed by the mayor and commission after consultation with the manager and attorney regarding the PHO qualifications and duties. Employees who are subject to disciplinary action or who make a claim of illegal discrimination or harassment, as those terms are defined in Chapter 1-17 of this Code, shall have the right to due process through the managerial chain of command, with certain matters appealable to the PHO. The PHO shall have jurisdiction to hear the following matters: (1) appeals of dismissals due to disciplinary action; (2) appeals of demotions due to disciplinary action; (3) appeals of suspensions due to disciplinary action; and (4) appeals involving claims of illegal discrimination or harassment as described in Chapter 1-17 of this Code. The PHO shall exhibit mature reasoning, prudent stewardship of public funds, evidence of good judgment, and impartial and nonpolitical performance of these duties.
a.
Personnel hearing officer. The PHO has final authority within the Unified Government to hear appeals within his or her jurisdiction.
b.
Criteria for review. In an appeal to the PHO, the appellant shall have the burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that:
1.
The Unified Government imposed discipline upon the appellant that is not consistent with this Code, the policies, practices, or procedures of the Unified Government, or any applicable laws of the State of Georgia;
2.
The factual basis upon which the Unified Government imposed disciplinary action upon the appellant is not true and correct or was substantially inaccurate in all relevant and material aspects; or
3.
An incident of illegal discrimination or harassment, as described in Chapter 1-17, took place, and the Unified Government failed to address such illegal discrimination or harassment as required by applicable law.
c.
Appeal hearings. In regard to appeals of disciplinary actions, the PHO shall have authority to confirm or rescind the disciplinary action in question, but shall not have authority to substitute an alternative form of discipline. The PHO may provide management with supplementary observations, comments, and recommendations regarding alternative levels of discipline for consideration by management. In regard to claims of illegal discrimination or harassment, the PHO shall have the authority to make factual and legal findings as to whether or not illegal discrimination or harassment occurred, and upon so finding, the PHO may recommend remedies or relief based upon applicable law. The PHO shall adopt procedures for the conduct of appeal hearings. The admissibility of documents or other information and the rules of evidence may be informal as compared to formal judicial proceedings. The PHO shall have the authority to compel attendance of witnesses, rule on motions, grant continuances, and rule on evidentiary matters.
d.
Types of cases. The PHO shall hear those matters appealed in accordance with the applicable procedures and within the PHO's jurisdiction. The PHO shall not hear appeals involving temporary records such as corrective interview documentation, performance evaluations, and notices of reprimands or similar documentation temporarily held in the employee's personnel file, appeals involving promotion decisions, or appeals involving involuntary transfers, unless such appeals are directly related to a claim of illegal discrimination or harassment. Notices of reprimand shall be removed from an employee's file if two years have passed since the issue in question occurred and there have been no problems of a similar nature.
e.
Appointment of personnel hearing officer. The mayor shall make a nomination to the commission for appointment of one attorney as the primary PHO and one or more alternate attorneys who shall be similarly appointed in case the primary PHO is not available when needed to conduct a hearing. The PHO shall be appointed by a majority vote of the entire commission and may be removed by majority vote of the entire commission. The initial appointment shall be for a two-year term and shall be subject to replacement or reappointment at the end of the term.

h.
Appeal hearings and record keeping. The PHO shall hold appeal hearings as soon as necessary when properly petitioned by an Athens-Clarke County personnel system employee who has a qualified reason for requesting a hearing. All such hearings shall be open to the public. The personnel director shall set the date, time and place of the hearing, providing proper notification to the affected parties. The time and place of each appeal hearing; names of the persons present; and all official acts of the PHO shall be recorded in the minutes, or in the alternative, a licensed court reporter or stenographer shall be present to transcribe the hearing. An agenda, including all items to be presented to the PHO, shall be prepared by the personnel director prior to each appeal hearing, or in the alternative, the PHO may require the parties to submit written position statements setting forth the issues to be heard and their basic contentions. If no licensed court reporter or stenographer is present for the hearing, the minutes shall be transcribed and presented for approval or amendment by the PHO.

A department director may establish standard operating procedures for an individual department not to conflict with the personnel system. Department rules and regulations must be approved in writing by the personnel director or a designee before they are implemented within a department. The personnel director or a designee will review the proposed departmental rules and regulations to verify their compliance with the personnel system. If there are any discrepancies, the department director must be notified of these in writing. Department rules and regulations, which have been approved by the personnel director or a designee, shall be posted in a public place in the department at least five (5) working days prior to their effective date.

Elected or appointed official. Where an elected or appointed official who is not subject to the manager's chain of command has employees under the personnel system and the personnel system gives final authority to the manager for disciplinary action or the selection of an individual to fill a position through appointment, promotion, or transfer, then, such final authority will reside with the authorized elected or appointed official. However, and unless otherwise specified, the authorized elected or appointed official shall implement all personnel decisions, including disciplinary action or the selection of an individual to fill a position though appointment, promotion, or transfer, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the personnel system.
(e)
Amendment of personnel system. Any employee of the government may submit a proposed amendment to the personnel system. Amendments should be submitted to the department director who will make a recommendation to the personnel director. The personnel director shall review and make a recommendation to the manager.

Written job descriptions for each title; and
d.
The system of classification level showing the title of each position included in the personnel system.

The personnel director or a designee shall examine the responsibilities of new positions as they are created and then assign them to an existing level within the classification system. If there is a need to do so, the personnel director may recommend to the manager any changes in the classification system that may be made necessary by changes in the responsibilities of existing or new positions.
The personnel director or a designee shall periodically review the entire pay classification plan and make recommendations to the manager for changes as they are needed.

Employees will be notified of the classification grade, and associated pay grade, assigned to their individual positions. When a new position is established, department directors shall submit in writing a comprehensive job description that explains in detail the duties of the position. The personnel director or a designee shall investigate described duties and then assign the position an appropriate classification grade by using the currently approved classification system. The personnel director or a designee shall notify the department director or a designee of the classification that is to be assigned to the position to ensure that funds will be made available for the designated classification. The department director will then notify the respective employee of the classification assignment.

The new position request upon approval by the manager will be submitted as a part of the budget process to the commission for action; and
d.
All new positions will become effective at the beginning of the new budget year unless otherwise stated.
(5)

(b)
Probationary status of new employees:
(1)
Purpose. The probationary or training period is an important part of the evaluation process. This period is used to observe the work of a new employee. This time observation can help a supervisor or department director in decisions that need to be made concerning the employee's adjustment to new responsibilities. It is also during this period that a supervisor or department director may become aware that an employee is incapable of handling the responsibilities of the new position.
Each new employee who is appointed to a regular position will serve the designated probationary period prior to obtaining regular status as a personnel system employee. An employee on probationary status has no rights under the personnel system.
An employee who is selected from a re-employment list will be required to serve the stated probationary period for that position as a new hire. If the employee does not successfully complete the probationary period, he will be separated without the right of appeal.
(2)
Length of probationary period. The standard probationary period shall be for six (6) months following employment to a regular position. Any positions requiring longer probationary periods will be so stated in the job description. An employee who has not completed their designated probationary period and is either promoted, demoted or transferred must begin a new probationary period upon the change.
(3)
Extension of probationary period. If a department director requests an extension of a probationary period at least ten working days prior to the end of the original probationary period, an extension may be granted by the personnel director. This extension of time will be a maximum of six (6) months beyond the normal probationary period. The extension may be suspended prior to the end of the extended six (6) months if the supervisor evaluates and submits in writing an evaluation of the incumbent that shows acceptable job performance. An employee who is to be held in a probationary status beyond the original probationary six-month period shall be notified in writing of this extension by the personnel director. An employee on a 12-month probationary period who is to be held in a probationary status beyond the original probationary 12-month period may be extended for three (3) months.
(4)
Evaluation during probation period. During the probationary period, a six-month probationary employee shall be evaluated in the second and fifth month and a 12-month probationary period employee shall be evaluated in the third, seventh and eleventh month. The department director or other designated supervisory personnel shall prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance. This evaluation shall include information concerning the employee's willingness and ability to perform their duties satisfactorily.
During the probationary period, the employee's supervisor will be responsible for providing additional instruction to the employee about satisfactory performance and job expectations.
(5)
Eligibility after dismissal during probationary period. If an employee is dismissed from a position during or at the end of a probationary period, the employee's name may be returned to the list from which it was certified if such employee has been recommended for re-employment. This may only occur if the personnel director decides that the employee is suitable for appointment to another position.
(c)
Methods of filling vacancies. Vacancies in the personnel system may be filled by any of the following: re-employment, external list, internal list, promotion, transfer, and/or demotion. Whenever possible, vacancies shall be anticipated far enough in advance to allow the personnel director or a designee ample time to decide who may be eligible for appointment or, if necessary, develop an eligibility list. After interviewing qualified applicants from the external list, the department director may be requested by the personnel director to submit written justification for their selection. Vacancies are to be filled by appointment in the following order:
(1)
Re-employment list;
(2)
External and/or internal list.

(a)
Promotion. A promotion is the moving of a regular employee to a position in a class having a higher classification level.
(1)
Application for promotion. Employees who are seeking promotion must apply for announced vacancies according to specific application requirements for each position. The qualifications of each employee making application for promotion will be reviewed. The names of the employees found to meet the minimum requirements for the desired position will be placed on the internal list.
(2)
Basis for awarding promotion; procedures for promotion review panel. When a vacancy exists, and the department director elects to fill the vacancy from the internal list, and there are two (2) or more qualified employees on the internal list, the personnel director shall convene a promotion review panel. The manager, in consultation with the personnel director, shall have the authority to issue policies and procedures for the promotion review panel.
(3)
Promotion Review Panel. The promotion review panel shall generally consist of the following three (3) members:

The department director for the department in which the vacancy exists or his or her designee;
b.
An assistant director, division administrator, or other supervisory employee from the department in which the vacancy exists; and
c.

In the event that any of the persons listed above are unable to attend a meeting of a promotion review panel or for another valid business reason, the personnel director, or in the absence of the personnel director, the assistant personnel director, shall have the authority to name a replacement. The personnel director or the department director may also request that other employees of the personnel department or the department in which the vacancy exists attend the meeting to provide information regarding the vacancy and the internal candidates for such vacancy. A meeting of a promotion review panel is intended to be a collaborative process in which all members of the panel concur as to the top candidate for promotion. If all members of the promotion review panel are unable to concur as to the top candidate, the department director or the personnel director shall have the authority to refer the matter to the manager for resolution.
(4)
Salary increase and evaluation period for promotion. An employee who is promoted to a classification grade, which calls for a higher pay grade than their previous classification grade, shall receive a salary increase of five (5) percent of the midpoint in the new pay grade, not to exceed the maximum rate in the new pay grade, or advance to the entry level of the new pay grade, whichever is greater. A successful evaluation period must be completed by the employee; however, there will be no salary adjustment upon the completion of the evaluation period.
An employee promoted to a higher classification shall serve a designated evaluation period. The length of the evaluation period will be included on the job description. An employee promoted from the internal list who does not successfully complete the evaluation period shall be returned to the position in the classification level that was occupied prior to the promotion if such position is available. If a position is not available, the employee will be placed on the re-employment list for up to one (1) year.
A regular employee who has been promoted as a personnel system employee to another classification shall retain formal appeal procedure privileges.
(b)
Transfer. A transfer is a lateral move from one position to another within the same classification. When an employee is transferred, the employee's pay shall remain at the same rate.
(1)
Application for transfer. The transfer of an employee shall not change the status (probationary or regular) of that employee nor shall there be any loss of benefits.
(2)
Voluntary transfer. An employee may request a transfer by submitting a request for transfer to another position to the personnel department. All transfer applicants must meet the minimum qualifications for the desired position and compete for the job vacancy along with all others on the eligibility list for the position. An evaluation period may be requested by the department director of the personnel director.
(3)
Involuntary transfer. An employee may be transferred without consent upon the written recommendation of the department director(s) and the approval of the personnel director. An evaluation period may be requested by the department director of the personnel director.
(c)
Demotion. A demotion is the movement of an employee to a lower classification level.
(1)
Reasons for demotion. An employee may be demoted for any of the following reasons:
a.
When an employee does not perform the duties and responsibilities of the position at an acceptable level of expectation as determined by the department director.
b.
When an employee would otherwise be laid off because the position is being abolished due to lack of work or lack of funds.
c.
When the employee's position has been reclassified to a higher level of responsibility for which the employee is not qualified.
d.
When an employee requests a demotion, that employee must compete for the particular job vacancy, along with all others who may be on the eligibility list for the position.
(2)
Demotion recommendations:
a.
Demotion recommendation by department director. If the department director decides demotion of an employee is necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the organization, the department director may prepare a written recommendation to the personnel director that an employee should be demoted. The recommendation should state detailed reasons for the demotion and the proposed effective date. The personnel director shall make a recommendation to the manager. With the approval of the manager, the personnel director will initiate the demotion process by notifying the department director. It is the responsibility of the department director to notify the employee of the demotion, in writing, stating the reasons for the demotion, the effective date and the employee's right of appeal under the personnel system. The demotion will become effective no sooner than five (5) working days after the date of its delivery to the employee. The employee may exercise appeal rights under the appeal provisions of the personnel system.
b.
Results of demotion. An employee who is demoted shall be reduced in pay such that their salary, after demotion, shall have the same percentage relationship to the pay grade minimum of the new position (demoted position) as did their former salary to the pay grade minimum of their former (pre-demoted) position.
Demotions do not require evaluations. However, requests for evaluations may be made by department directors to the personnel director. Demotions do not affect an employee's status (probationary or regular) nor shall there be any loss of benefits.

(4)
Requesting vacation leave. Each department shall establish a department policy designating the advance notice that must be given by an employee desiring to take vacation leave and any conditions under which the advance notice requirement may be waived. Such department policies are essential because of the different work schedules and operating procedures within different departments, and such policies shall be approved in accordance with the procedures set forth in this plan. Forms provided by the personnel department should be used by employees requesting vacation leave.
(5)
Time for using vacation leave. Vacation leave assignments will be made according to the preference of the employee where practical. However, leave must be taken at the convenience of the department and the department director's decision when leave may or may not be taken shall be final. Employees shall accrue vacation leave from the date of employment. Employees are, however, not eligible to receive paid vacation or pay in lieu of vacation until the completion of six (6) months employment. Earned leave shall be accrued to a maximum accrual of twice the employee's annual accrual rate and if not used will be forfeited. Department policies shall establish the minimum leave that may be taken per leave request but under no circumstances may vacation leave be granted in less than one-hour increments.
(6)
Payment in lieu of vacation leave. Pay in lieu of accrued vacation leave is authorized when an employee is separated from employment by resignation, dismissal, death, disability or retirement. The accrued vacation leave of employees who die in the service of the government shall be paid to the living spouse or estate of such employees or to whom the employee may have designated as beneficiary.
(b)
Holiday leave:
(1)
General holiday leave policy. It shall be the policy of the government to ensure that all employees enjoy the same number of holidays each year. For regular employees on a workweek other than Monday through Friday, a department policy shall be established to designate the procedure for observing an alternate day for holidays which do not fall on the scheduled work day and the time frame in which an employee has to observe such a holiday before the accrued holiday time is forfeited. Regular part-time employees will be eligible for holiday pay on a ratio of their percent of time worked to the full-time workweek.
(2)

(4)
Time off for work performed on scheduled holiday. Employees who are required to work on any day officially designated as a holiday will be granted a compensatory day in lieu of the holiday at a future date that is acceptable to the employee's department director. Each department will establish a department regulation concerning the manner in which employees will be able to request and observe days off in lieu of worked holidays. Compensatory time in lieu of a holiday must be taken within 12 months or such time is forfeited.
(5)
Holiday compensation on unpaid leave status. Any employee who is in an unpaid leave status on the work day immediately prior to or following an official holiday shall not receive compensation for that holiday.

(1)
Definition of sick leave. Sick leave is paid leave that may be granted to each eligible employee who through sickness or injury becomes incapacitated to a degree that makes it impossible for the employee to perform the duties of the position; or who is quarantined because of exposure to a contagious disease; or who requires leave for medical, dental or optical examination or treatment; or whose immediate family member requires the employee's care for any of the above reasons.
(2)
Eligibility for sick leave. All employees eligible to receive benefits under section 1-9-5 above are eligible to accrue sick leave.
(3)
Accrual of sick leave. All regular full-time employees shall accrue sick leave at the rate of eight (8) hours per month. Regular employees working less than full-time shall accrue on a prorated basis. Sick leave time shall accrue from the date of employment, but no employee shall be entitled to receive sick leave time until the completion of one (1) month of service. A biweekly employee who has taken sick leave with or without pay for ten working days shall not earn sick leave credit for the following pay period. A weekly employee who has taken sick leave with or without pay for ten working days shall not earn sick leave credit for the following two (2) pay periods. Employees shall not accrue any sick leave while out on short-term disability. Sick leave is not required to be used within the year in which earned, but may be accumulated from month to month and year to year.
(4)
Sick leave buy-back. To be eligible for the following sick leave buy-back plan an employee must have accrued a minimum of 192 sick leave hours. An eligible employee may be awarded pay for sick leave upon request as follows: An employee who uses no sick leave days during a fiscal year, the government shall buy back 24 hours; an employee who uses no more than eight (8) sick leave hours during a fiscal year, the government shall buy back 16 hours; and an employee who uses more than eight (8) but not more than 16 hours during a fiscal year, the government shall buy back eight (8) hours. Only those employees who are in an "active" (currently working and receiving a payroll check) status on the date the checks are issued are eligible for this benefit. Employees in an unpaid "leave-of-absence," layoff or short-term disability status are not eligible for this program. Employees out of work but receiving a payroll check for worker's compensation are eligible.
The actual buy-back payment shall occur on or before July 31 immediately following the fiscal year during which the employee earned pay for sick leave under this paragraph. This paragraph shall remain inoperative unless it is affirmatively ratified and funded by the mayor and commission prior to any fiscal year in which it is intended to be effective.
(5)
Use of sick leave:
a.
Personal illness of employee. Sick leave is not to be considered a right that employees may use at their discretion, but a privilege not to be abused. Employees are to use sick leave for their personal or immediate family illnesses (i.e., father, mother, spouse, children or any other individual living in the same household). Sick leave is accumulated based on working days and will be charged against an employee only for those days an employee is scheduled to work and is unable to report to work because of illness. Absence for a fraction or a part of a day that is chargeable in accordance with these provisions shall be charged proportionally in amounts not smaller than one (1) hour.
b.
Job-related accident or injury of employee. An employee who sustains a job-related injury arising out of and in the course of employment must at the time of the injury, or as soon as possible thereafter, notify his or her supervisor. The department director shall follow the prescribed policies for reporting job-related accidents or injuries. Employees who are otherwise eligible for sick leave accumulations and receive injury arising out of and in the course of employment shall be paid for lost time because of the job-related injury for up to a maximum of 120 working days for each new and separate injury in addition to and prior to the use of sick leave accumulation. To receive compensation provided by this section, the employee must submit a physician's statement to the effect that the injury will prevent the employee from working. The government shall reserve the right to have an independent medical examination performed at the government's expense.
When lost time, because of a job-related injury, is covered by the state Workers' Compensation Act, the employee shall be paid the difference between the actual salary and those payments received as workers' compensation benefits, social security benefits and any disability benefits received under a government sponsored program for 120 days. In the event of extended absence in excess of 120 working days resulting from a job-related injury, the employee may use all accumulated sick leave and vacation leave prior to being placed on unpaid leave. The employee will continue to receive entitled workers' compensation benefits even if placed on unpaid leave.
c.
A nonrelated accident or injury of employee. An employee who is unable to work because of an illness or accident that is not job-related shall be allowed to use accrued sick leave and/or vacation leave, or the employee may elect to receive benefits under the short-term disability insurance plan. In no event shall an employee use sick leave and vacation leave for any time for which short-term disability benefits are received.
(6)
Reporting of sick leave. An employee who is absent from work because of illness is responsible for reporting to the appropriate supervisor or department director by telephone or personal message in the manner prescribed in each department's regulations for sick leave reporting. The employee will be expected to keep the supervisor or department director informed of progress on a daily basis when the illness extends beyond one (1) working day.
(7)
Requirement of doctor's certificate. In order for an employee to be compensated under the provisions of the sick leave policy, a doctor's certificate must be provided by the employee for any period of absence of five (5) or more working days. Department directors, at their discretion, may require an employee to furnish a doctor's certificate for periods of less than five (5) working days if the department director feels that an employee is abusing the sick leave privilege. The government reserves the right to investigate any possible abuses of sick leave.
(8)
Advance of sick leave. An employee who has no accumulated sick leave may not be advanced sick leave against future accumulations. However, in the event of illness, time off may be granted at the discretion of the department director under the provisions of other emergency leave section (subsection (g)(2) below).
(9)
Sick leave upon termination of employment. Except as provided in this subparagraph and in section 1-14-2(6) regarding conversion of sick leave to credited service for eligible participants in the Athens-Clarke County Employees' Pension Plan, an employee, upon separation from service, shall not be eligible to receive payment or credit for any accumulated sick leave. Provided, however, that employees who at the time of retirement meet the following conditions:
a.
Reach the minimum age of 55; and
b.
Complete ten years of continuous creditable service, work up to retirement, and begin drawing deferred compensation distributions from the Management Defined Contribution Plan Program to which this government has made contributions on their behalf as a percentage of such employee's compensation and who have not been participants in the Athens-Clarke County Employees' Pension Plan, may request, in connection with an application for retirement benefits through the Management Defined Contribution Plan Program in which such employee participates, that the balance of that employee's unused, accrued sick leave be converted to a monetary value using the formula hereinafter described, and that such amount be paid as a one-time employer contribution to the employee's Management Defined Contribution Plan Program account upon the employee's retirement. In no event shall such contribution, together with other employer and/or employee contributions to such account within a calendar year, exceed the maximum contributions to such account allowed by federal or state law or regulation. The formula for determining such monetary value shall be as follows: accrued sick leave hours shall be multiplied by the retiring employee's hourly rate of pay, with that result being multiplied by the percentage amount (either eight percent or ten percent) that had been used to determine contributions to that employee's Management Defined Contribution Plan Program account. The sick leave benefits described in this paragraph are not pension benefits; said employees do not receive them as vested rights; and such benefits are subject to change by the Mayor and Commission at any time during said employee's service or after separation from employment.
(d)
Military leave. All matters regarding military leave for employees covered by the personnel system shall be governed by the provisions of state law; particularly O.C.G.A. § 38-2-279 entitled, "Rights of Public Officers and Employees Absent on Military Duty as Members of Organized Militia or Reserve Forces."
(e)
Civil leave. An employee shall be given necessary time off, without loss of pay, when performing jury duty or when required by proper authority to be a witness in legal proceedings, provided such call to duty is reported in advance to the employee's department director. At the discretion of the department director, an employee also may be granted civil leave when performing emergency civil defense duty in connection with a disaster, or for voting when the polls are not open at least two (2) hours before and after the employee's scheduled hours of work.
(f)
Maternity leave. Leave of absence requested due to pregnancy, childbirth, adoption or related conditions may be granted under the existing provisions of the personnel system relating to leave of absence. Such leaves of absence may include, but are not limited to, sick leave, vacation, short-term disability or leave of absence without pay. Maternity-related conditions shall be treated the same as any other illness.
(g)
Emergency leave:
(1)
Funeral leave. Upon the death of a member of the immediate family, an employee may be granted up to three (3) working days of leave, charged to accumulated leave (sick or vacation). Immediate family for funeral leave shall be defined as spouse, mother, father, step-parent, son, daughter, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, stepson, stepdaughter, brother, brother-in-law, sister, sister-in-law, half-brother, half-sister, grandchild, grandparent, grandparent of spouse.
On an individual basis the department director, with the concurrence of the personnel director, may authorize funeral leave for death of nonrelatives.
Upon request of the employee, the personnel director may extend the three (3) days maximum limit on funeral leave.
(2)
Other emergency leave. In the event that any employee has an emergency which creates an extreme hardship for the employee and prevents attendance at work, the employee's department director may recommend that the employee be placed on emergency leave without pay and the time not charged to any accrued leave. Such emergency leave may be granted by the personnel director with the approval of the manager. The decision of the manager to approve or disapprove such recommendations will be final.
(h)
Leave without pay. A regular employee who has completed the probationary period and is covered by the personnel system may be granted leave without pay for personal or other reasons, provided such leave is recommended by the department director and approved by the personnel director. Such leave shall be considered a privilege and not a right, and the employee's request for leave of absence without pay shall be considered when the employee has shown by the records to be a valuable employee to the government. Such leaves may be granted up to one (1) year.
Upon request, an employee on leave without pay may return to their former position if available (within one (1) year). If the position is not available, the employee may apply for other job vacancies in the government and compete with all other candidates and is subject to the provisions of section 1-9-5(b) above.
(i)
Short-term disability. An employee may elect to receive benefits under the short-term disability insurance plan. An employee may leave active employment for a disability when he or she cannot perform the required duties of the position because of a physical or mental impairment. This action may be initiated by the employee or his or her legal representative. The department director will make a recommendation to the personnel director for approval of such leave. An employee on short-term disability may return to his or her former position if available (within six (6) months). If the position is not available, the employee may apply for other job vacancies in the government and compete with all other candidates. Employees hired in this manner are subject to section 1-9-5(b) above.

Sec. 1-9-8. - Separation and disciplinary action.
(a)
Separations:
(1)
Types of separation:
a.
Resignation. An employee wishing to leave the government in good standing shall file with their department director a written resignation. The employee should give at least a two-week notice of his or her intention to resign unless the department director consents to their leaving sooner. The written resignation shall be forwarded to the personnel department.
b.
Abandonment of job. An employee who is absent from work for three (3) working days or more without notifying their department director of the reasons for the absence and obtaining permission to remain absent from work shall be considered as having resigned without notice and not in good standing.
When an employee fails to return to work within three (3) working days of the expiration of authorized leave without notifying their department director of the reasons for the absence and obtaining permission to remain absent from work, the employee shall be considered as having resigned without notice and not in good standing. However, under justified circumstances, exceptions will be reviewed by the department director, and a recommendation made to the manager through the personnel director.
Employees who do not resign in good standing may be denied future employment with the government.
c.
Reduction in force (RIF). The manager may authorize a reduction in force including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
1.
Shortage of work;
2.
Shortage of funds;
3.
Abolishment of a position;
4.
Changes in duty;
5.
Changes in the organization; or
6.
Other related reasons that are outside the control of an employee that do not reflect discredit upon the service of an employee.
The duties performed by an employee laid off may be reassigned to other employees already working who hold positions in appropriate classifications. No regular employee covered by the personnel system shall be laid off while another person in a similar classification is employed as a seasonal, emergency, temporary or provisional appointment. The manager will decide when a reduction in force is required. The layoff of employees shall be in inverse order determined by length of service with the government and the employee's classification. Alternatives to a reduction in force, including reduction of work hours for employees, may be considered by the manager.
d.
Long-term disability. An eligible (two (2) years from date of employment) employee may leave active employment for a disability when he or she cannot perform the required duties of his or her position because of a physical or mental impairment. This action may be initiated by the employee or his or her legal representative. In all cases, this action must be supported by medical evidence. In disability or potential disability cases, the government may require the employee to have an examination by a government-approved physician at the expense of the government. The department director shall notify the personnel director for approval of such leave. If an employee accepts long-term disability, he or she will forfeit his or her re-employment rights.
Employees who meet the eligibility requirement may apply for benefits under any type of disability plan offered as a part of the government's benefit package.
e.
Retirement. When an employee meets the conditions, set forth in the retirement plan regulations for the government, the employee may elect to retire and receive all benefits under the retirement plan.
f.
Death. Separation shall be effective as of the date of death of any employee covered by the personnel system. All monies due shall be paid to the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, or estate of the employee, except such compensation that by law must be paid to the surviving spouse. Compensation payment may include:
1.
Payment for time worked;
2.
Payment for any accrued vacation; and
3.
Payment for accrued holiday leave.
g.
Progressive disciplinary action. When circumstances allow, supervisors are encouraged to pursue a philosophy of "progressive discipline" by administering gradually increasing disciplinary actions for each successive instance of employee misconduct. Thus, whenever an employee's performance, work habits or personal conduct at any time falls below an acceptable level, supervisors are encouraged to use progressive disciplinary action. If improvements are not evident after a specified period, more progressive disciplinary action may be justified.
A specific incident may justify immediate suspension and/or dismissal.
The following are acceptable steps in the progressive disciplinary action process:
1.
Additional instruction and a verbal reminder regarding the standards and expectations of the job.
2.
Written reminder regarding a specific plan and steps toward improvement.
3.
In situations where additional instructions and written plans have not resulted in agreed upon expectations and improvements, a written reprimand shall be initiated as disciplinary action. Copies of any written reprimands or written reminders must be provided to the employee. Written reprimands shall be forwarded to the personnel department for placement in the employee's personnel file and shall remain in the file for two (2) years from the date of issue. After this time the written reprimand will be removed from the file and will no longer be used in determining personnel actions. In the event that additional disciplinary actions have been taken during the two-year period, the retention period for the initial reprimand will be extended for two (2) years after the effective date of the next disciplinary action.

An employee may be suspended without pay by the department director as a form of progressive disciplinary action. The department director may suspend an employee for up to five (5) working days, which shall be reviewed by the personnel director for compliance with procedural requirements. A written notice by the department director will advise the employee of the suspension and the reasons for the suspension.
When an employee has acted in a way that may require severe disciplinary action, the department director may recommend to the personnel director for an extension of the five (5) working day suspension without pay (not to exceed 15 calendar days). Upon recommendation by the department director to the personnel director and with the concurrence of the manager, the suspension may be extended to 30 calendar days.
An employee who is suspended for five (5) working days or more shall not accrue any leave time, including vacation and/or sick leave, nor shall an employee use leave time while on suspension.

Immediate suspension. In situations where an employee's actions or physical or mental condition is such that his or her actions present a serious danger to life or property of citizens, or fellow employees, an employee shall be suspended immediately without prior notice.
A written notice of the suspension and the reason for the suspension shall be given to the employee at the time the employee is suspended.
When an employee has acted, or is alleged to have acted, in a way that would subject the employee to severe disciplinary action, including possible dismissal, a department director may suspend the employee on an indefinite basis while the charges are being investigated.
Employees may be suspended under these circumstances, without prior written notice, if, in the opinion of the department director, the employee should be removed from the position while the charges are being investigated. For an indefinite suspension of this nature to extend beyond five (5) working days, it must be approved by the personnel director. Under no circumstances shall a suspension, while investigative action is taking place, be extended beyond 30 calendar days unless court action is pending.
An employee who has been suspended during the investigation of charges who is cleared of the charges following the investigation shall be reinstated without loss of pay, privileges, benefits or status.
An employee who is suspended shall turn in all keys to the workplace, ID cards, pertinent documents, department equipment, any assigned vehicle, assigned badge, and/or gun in his or her possession belonging to the government. Such employee shall not be allowed into his or her workplace area without prior notice and approval of his or her supervisor and the department director. The employee shall clearly state the reason for wanting to return to his or her workplace prior to approval being granted or denied.
i.
Dismissal. Disciplinary action need not precede dismissal. However, all dismissals will be preceded by an automatic three (3) working day suspension with pay, pending the completion of an investigation by the personnel director.
If the personnel director decides that the dismissal is appropriate, such dismissal shall be effective at the end of the three (3) working day suspension.
If the dismissal is made at the end of the three-day suspension period, a written summary shall be prepared by the personnel director, giving the circumstances and facts leading to the dismissal.
A copy of the written summary and the appeal procedure shall be delivered to the employee by certified mail. A copy of the dismissal and written summary shall be filed in the employee's personnel file and a copy of each shall be forwarded to the department director.

Re-employment rights of employees. Employees who are separated involuntarily, or whose jobs are terminated through no fault of their own, and who desire to be considered for re-employment with the government will be placed on the re-employment list. Employees may remain on the re-employment list for a period not to exceed one (1) year.
The employees will be listed by seniority in terms of service and will be offered re-employment for the first vacancy that becomes available in the same classification level for which they are qualified. All employees appointed to a position in this manner will serve the stated probationary period for that position as a new hire; if such employees do not successfully complete the probationary period they will be separated without the right of appeal.
An employee may voluntarily accept a position at a lower classification level than their former position, in so doing all provisions of the re-employment rights section apply, as well as being removed from the re-employment list.
An employee who is placed on the re-employment list, who does not accept the first offer for re-employment in a position having the same classification as the one held by the employee at the time of separation, will be removed from the re-employment list.
Such employees will no longer have guarantee of re-employment rights when a vacancy occurs but may be considered for re-employment on the same basis as any other applicant.

Retirees shall be responsible for all premiums associated with Medicare Parts A and B and all costs associated with Medicare Parts A and B not otherwise covered by secondary insurance plans that may be selected by retirees.
(2)
Beginning September 1, 2013, retirees who are age 65 and older and who at the time of retirement have opted into health insurance coverage or the benefits described in this paragraph, as applicable, shall receive the benefits described in this paragraph. From and after the time that a retiree turns 65 and during the lifetime of the retiree, Athens-Clarke County shall make monthly contributions to a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) (within the meaning of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2002-45) established on behalf of the retiree. For retirees who had spouse coverage provided by Athens-Clarke County at no cost to them, based on a hire date before 1/1/1994, Athens-Clarke County shall make an equivalent contribution to an HRA established for the spouse, and held jointly with the retiree, until the death of the retiree. Except for members of the Settlement Class (as defined below), the amount of contributions will be determined by the Mayor and Commission as set out in the annual budget ordinance and may change from time to time.
Athens-Clarke County will select and make available to retirees and eligible spouses a marketplace through which individuals may purchase health insurance such as Medigap, Medicare Advantage, and/or Medicare Part D, including one or more plans comparable to the Designated Plan.

For retirees hired on or after July 1, 2002, the amount to be contributed by Athens-Clarke County shall be an amount no less than the monthly premium amount charged, by a provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the marketplace, for one or more plans comparable to the Designated Plan that collaborates with Medicare Parts A and B, described in paragraph (b) and made available to retirees through a marketplace.
For retirees who are members of a settlement class defined by the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, Athens Division, in a final approval order entered by the court in the case of David Wood, et al. v. Unified Government of Athens-Clarke County, Civil Action No. 3:14-cv-00043-CDL, hereinafter referred to as the "Settlement Class," said order creating the Settlement Class and directing relief to members of the Settlement Class, the amount to be contributed by Athens-Clarke County to the HRAs of members of the Settlement Class (and eligible spouses) shall be no less than $228.00 per month, beginning with Fiscal Year 2020 (July 1, 2019—June 30, 2020), during the lifetime of each Settlement Class member and eligible dependent, hereinafter referred to as the "Class Settlement HRA Base Amount." Beginning in Fiscal Year 2021, Athens-Clarke County shall adjust the Class Settlement HRA Base Amount in an amount equal to 50% of the percentage increase or decrease in the federal CPI-U, for the preceding calendar year, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (or any successor agency), up to a maximum HRA increase of 5.0% in any one year, provided that such amount shall never be less than the Class Settlement HRA Base Amount (the "Adjusted Class Settlement HRA Amount"). For each successive fiscal year, ACC will modify the then-current Adjusted Class Settlement HRA Amount by applying 50% of the percentage increase or decrease in the federal CPI-U, for the preceding calendar year, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (or any successor agency), up to a maximum HRA increase of 5.0% in any one year.
For all retirees (and eligible spouses) receiving a contribution by ACC to an HRA, if the federal or any state government implements some form of universal, premium-free health insurance for which retirees, or certain retirees, are eligible, ACC reserves the right to determine whether its contributions to an HRA—in whole or in part—for each such retiree eligible to receive universal, premium-free health insurance from the federal or a state government should continue, provided that ACC will not reduce, suspend, or terminate contributions to a Settlement Class member's HRA unless the sum of the actuarial value of the universal premium-free health insurance plus the actuarial value of a reduced HRA contribution by ACC, if any, equals or exceeds the actuarial value of the health insurance obtainable with the then-current Adjusted Class Settlement HRA Amount.
If a retiree chooses to enroll in a plan with premiums higher than the contributions made by Athens-Clarke County, the retiree assumes any additional cost of such coverage. Funds in an HRA may be used for any eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses that a retiree may incur, including, but not limited to payment by the retiree of any plan premiums based on the retiree's plan election. Nothing in this paragraph shall require a retiree to purchase an insurance plan supplemental to Medicare Parts A and B from a marketplace or otherwise, and retirees shall have the ability to use funds in an HRA for any purpose allowed by applicable law. Any existing health insurance coverage provided by Athens-Clarke County to those retirees described in this paragraph (c) terminated on August 31, 2013.
(d)
As to retirees who were hired on or after July 1, 2002 and as to dependents of retirees who were hired after December 31, 1993, health insurance or health benefits as described above shall be subject to termination or modification in any respect by the Mayor and Commission.
