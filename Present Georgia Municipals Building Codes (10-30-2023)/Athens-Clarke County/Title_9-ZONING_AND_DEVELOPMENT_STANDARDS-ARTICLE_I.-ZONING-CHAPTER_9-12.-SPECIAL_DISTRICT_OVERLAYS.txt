Sec. 9-12-7. - Milledge Avenue Corridor Special District Overlay.
A.
Purpose and intent. The purpose of the Milledge Avenue Corridor Special District Overlay is to address issues of public safety, health, and general welfare, including controlling the visual and architectural character of the Milledge Avenue Corridor Special District Overlay. The use of design requirements will help to ensure that new development is visually compatible with the existing historic character of Milledge Avenue and the adjacent residential neighborhoods and that the permitted uses are compatible with the adjacent neighborhoods. Special use requirements will help provide a balanced mix of uses within the Milledge Avenue Corridor and help ensure that the future establishment of or expansion of institutional residential uses or boarding house or dormitory uses will not overly-dominate the character of the Milledge Avenue Corridor and will help ensure future compatibility of these uses with adjacent residential neighborhoods. While the underlying zoning district designation generally provides for the allowed uses, the district overlay requires that new construction maintain residential character within the corridor by limiting the location of parking and stormwater management facilities, as well as providing for landscaped yards and open areas.
B.
