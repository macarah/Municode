Editor's note— An ordinance of April 3, 2007, § 1, amended the Code by repealing former ch. 7-4, §§ 7-4-1—7-4-20 and 7-4-50—7-4-61, in its entirety, and adding a new ch. 7-4. Former ch. 7-4 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from ordinances of October 4, 1994; July 2, 1996; July 6, 1999; December 5, 2000; November 6, 2001; and October 5, 2004.

Sec. 7-4-1. - Short title.
This chapter shall hereafter be known and cited as the "Athens-Clarke County Sign Ordinance."
(Ord. of 4-3-2007, § 1)
Sec. 7-4-2. - Objectives and purposes.
The objective of this chapter is to establish requirements for the placement, installation and maintenance of signs in order to preserve and protect the health, safety, welfare and general well being of the community's citizens. As the regulations of the placement, construction and maintenance of buildings and structures through zoning is a valid use of the police power, so too is the regulation of the placement, installation and maintenance of signs, since such signs in the literal sense must ordinarily be considered structures, and in a practical sense are capable of producing many of the same nuisances as are produced by buildings. The regulation of the placement, installation and maintenance of signs is further justified by the sign's innate scheme and primary purpose to draw mental attention to its content, potentially to the detriment of sound driving practices and the safety of the motoring public to whom a majority of the signs are oriented. Therefore, it is the intent of this chapter to regulate the size and location of signs such that their purpose can be served without unduly interfering with motorists and causing unsafe conditions. However, it is not the intent of this chapter that all signs be built to the maximum size. Athens-Clarke County encourages use of the minimum signage necessary to meet the purposes need.
Further, recognizing that the aesthetic, cultural and historic qualities of Athens-Clarke County are unique and, therefore, vital to the community's interest and its moniker as the "Classic City," it is the objective of this chapter to ensure compatibility to the aforementioned themes and to ensure that these qualities are not compromised.
Further, it is an objective of this chapter to protect and preserve the aesthetic qualities of the community by regulating the number, size, placement, type, installation and maintenance of signs. The fact that signs are intended to command visual contact grants to signs a proportionately greater role than other structures in determining the overall aesthetic quality of the community. Furthermore, automatic changeable copy signs have an even greater visual impact upon the community than other less visually intrusive signs and cause greater impairment of the aesthetic quality of the community than other types of lighted signs. The aesthetic impact of signs is an economic fact that can bear heavily upon the enjoyment and value of property; therefore, the regulation of signs is validly justified on the basis of conserving the value of property and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the community. It is contended that it is not irrational for a community's citizens to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness is minimized.
Further, it is an objective of this chapter to maintain content-neutrality in its signage regulations, and to denote the classification and categorization of sign types by their function. It is the intent of this chapter to expressly allow noncommercial copy to be substituted for commercial copy on permanent sign structures.
In addition, it is declared that the regulation of signs within Athens-Clarke County is necessary and in the public interest:
(1)
To protect property values within Athens-Clarke County.
(2)
To protect the motoring public from damage or injury caused or partially attributable to distractions or obstructions from improperly designed or situated signs.
(3)
To promote the economic well-being of Athens-Clarke County by creating a favorable physical image.
(4)
To improve the legibility and effectiveness of commercial and governmental signs.
(5)
To afford the business community and citizens opportunity to advertise and promote products and services or messages without discrimination.
(6)
To create and maintain high quality commercial districts.
(7)
To eliminate the clutter of excess signage.
(8)
To protect the right of citizens to enjoy Athens-Clarke County's natural scenic beauty.
(9)
To protect and enhance the unique aesthetic, cultural and historic attractions to tourists and thereby promote and stimulate business.
(10)
To regulate the construction, erection, maintenance and size of outdoor signs that may constitute a direct danger to pedestrians and property, especially during periods of high winds.
(11)
To protect the aircraft approaches to the local airport(s).
(12)
To balance the right of persons to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs.
(13)
To classify and categorize sign types by their function.
(14)
To expressly allow the substitution of noncommercial copy for commercial copy.
(15)
To preserve and promote the public health, safety and welfare in Athens-Clarke County.

(s)
Multiface signs. For purposes of determining the total sign square footage allowed for multiface signs, the total number of faces shall be divided by two and then added together and applied against the total square footage allowed. For example, only one face of a two-faced and/or double-faced sign shall be applied to the total square footage allowed (2 faces/2 = 1 face; therefore, only one face is applied against the total sign square footage). Odd-number-faced signs will be rounded up; e.g., a three-faced sign shall be handled thus: 3 faces/2 = 1.5 faces, which shall be rounded to two faces.

Figure 10

(a)
Billboard. In addition to the general provisions set forth in this chapter, billboards shall be subject to the following specific provisions:
(1)
The total number of billboard faces allowed under this chapter shall not exceed the total number of billboard faces and structures in existence as of September 4, 2018, as shown by the planning department inventory. In addition thereto, billboard permits issued on or before September 4, 2018, and constructed prior to the expiration of such permits shall be counted in the total number of billboard faces permitted. A new billboard face may be erected only if an existing billboard face is removed. Replacement billboard faces shall be the same square footage or smaller than the face(s) being removed. In addition, replacement billboard faces/structures may be erected only in accordance with provisions (2) through (8) listed below.
(2)
Billboards shall only be permitted in C-G, C-R, I, E-I and E-O zoning districts of Athens-Clarke County (only if the C-G property has frontage on a street listed in Appendix C, Commercial-General (C-G) Zoned Properties Allowing Billboards).
(3)
No billboard base, face or structure shall be located closer than 1,000 feet from any other billboard base, face, or structure located on the same side of the street measured linearly along the right-of-way. Distances shall be measured from the nearest point of any part of the billboard to the nearest point of any other part of a billboard.
(4)
No more than 12 billboard faces per linear mile, no more than six faces visible in any one direction, and no more than eight billboard structures shall be allowed. Billboards located at intersections will be counted on each street in which the face is visible for a distance of one block or 400 feet, whichever is less. Official state highway mile markers, when available, shall be used in determining the number of sites per mile. Where official state highway mile markers are not available, distances shall be measured from City Hall, 301 College Avenue.
(5)
No billboard base, face or structure shall be located within 150 feet of a residential zoning district, public park, public playground, school ground, cemetery, church, airport clear zone, or scenic area as designated by the mayor and commission as measured from the nearest point of any part of the billboard to the district, area boundary, or property line, measured linearly along the road. Nor should any part of a billboard face, base or structure be located closer than 50 feet from any lot line of a residential zoning district, public park, public playground, school ground, cemetery, church, airport clear zone, or scenic area as designated by the mayor and commission.
(6)
All parts of a billboard face, base and structure shall be set back a minimum of five feet from the side and rear property lines.
(7)
No more than two faces shall be displayed per billboard site to any direction of traffic flow with a total square footage not to exceed 600 square feet per side plus extended advertising space not to exceed 50 square feet per face nor extend more than three feet above the height of the face of the billboard.
(8)
No billboard shall be greater than 40 feet in height (excluding the extended advertising space). This height shall be measured from the grade at the right-of-way boundary line or the grade of the billboard site if such grade is higher than the grade at the boundary line of the street right-of-way to the uppermost part of the billboard face, base or structure. If the sign is located below the grade at the boundary line of the street right-of-way, sign height shall be measured from the edge of the right-of-way to the uppermost part of the billboard face, base or structure.
Measurement of Height from Grade
(b)
Special provisions for off-site directional signs.
(1)
Off-site directional signs shall only be permitted in C-G, C-R, AR, E-O, I, and E-I zoning districts, as defined in the official zoning map, and only businesses which are located on local and minor collector streets shall be permitted to use an off-site directional sign. Such directional sign(s) shall only be permitted on major collectors and arterial streets.
(2)
Off-site directional signs shall have a maximum of 16 square feet of area per face, with a maximum of two back-to-back faces and a maximum height of eight feet. Businesses eligible to erect an off-site directional sign may erect two such signs, provided that there is a minimum one-quarter mile between them as measured along the right-of-way.
(3)
Three or more businesses may advertise on one off-site directional sign, provided the sign meets the following requirements:
a.
The total square footage shall not exceed 64 square feet. An additional 24 square feet will be allowed for group identification.
b.
Each business sign shall be limited in size based on the number of existing businesses in an identifiable group/location. (For example, if an identifiable group/location has ten businesses, then each business sign would be limited to 6.4 square feet. This would hold true even if an existing business did not want to be listed on the sign at the time of sign construction.) In no instance shall a business be allowed more than 16 square feet of sign space.
c.
The maximum height for this type of directional sign shall be 15 feet.
d.
No more than one sign with multiple businesses shall be located on a single parcel.
(4)
Reserved.
(5)
Off-site directional signs shall be set back a minimum of five feet from the side and rear property lines. Distances shall be measured from the nearest portion of the sign to the property line. No more than two off-site directional signs shall be allowed per parcel. No two off-site directional signs shall be any closer to any other off-site directional signs than one-quarter mile.
(c)
Signs located in historic districts or historic landmark. The following regulations shall apply when the proposed sign is located at a contributing building within a historic district or in front of a locally-designated historic landmark:
(1)
In addition to an application for a sign permit, an application for a certificate of appropriateness for a sign must be filed for decision by the Historic Preservation Commission. At the election of the applicant, the application for the certificate of appropriateness may be submitted either prior to, or contemporaneous with, the processing of the application for a sign permit; however, the sign permit itself will not issue until the applicant secures a certificate of appropriateness. If the applicant elects to secure the certificate of appropriateness first before the processing of the application for a sign permit, then the processing of the sign permit application shall commence upon the submission of the certificate of appropriateness to the building official by the applicant and the 45-day time period set forth in section 7-4-22(d)(2) shall commence at that time. In making its decision to approve or deny the certificate of appropriateness for a sign, the Historic Preservation Commission shall apply the following criteria:
a.
The sign(s) shall comply with the sign type, number, size, height and setback standards for the underlying zoning district.
b.
The design of the sign shall be compatible with the design of the property, building or site upon which it is to be located.
c.
The sign's material shall be compatible with the period and style of the property, building or site.
d.
The sign's location shall not obscure any significant architectural features of the building or site.
e.
For the Downtown Local Historic District, the sign shall be in compliance with any applicable sign design guidelines.
f.
The content of the message shall not be considered.
(2)
Whenever a certificate of appropriateness is required for a sign, the certificate shall be granted or denied within 45 days from the filing of the initial complete application. If the certificate is not granted or denied within that time period, the applicant may proceed as if the certificate had been granted.
(3)
An appeal from any decision made on the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall follow the appeals procedure in chapter 8-5.
(4)
Any sign permit and sign permit application under this section shall be subject to all other requirements for the issuance of permits under section 7-4-22.
(Ord. of 4-3-2007, § 1; Ord. of 11-6-2018(2), § 1 )
Sec. 7-4-21. - Variances to sign requirements.
(a)
After denial of a sign permit by the building official, a property owner or sign contractor may either appeal the decision pursuant to section 7-4-22(e) or apply to the Hearings Board established under the zoning code for a variance by filing an application on a form to be obtained from the Planning Department. The variance request must be filed within ten calendar days after the denial of the sign permit. The variance request must be set for hearing within 45 calendar days of the filing of the complete written variance application.
(b)
The Hearings Board is authorized to grant such variance from the strict application of the requirements of this chapter related to sign setback, sign height, sign placement, and/or sign type (but only insofar as to whether the sign is a wall sign or freestanding sign) when due to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will, in an individual case, result in unusual hardship, so the spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. A variance to sign setback, height, placement or type may be granted in an individual case of unusual hardship upon a finding by the Hearings Board that the following conditions exist:
(1)
There exist extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from its size, shape, or topography which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area;
(2)
A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar properties;
(3)
Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any significant privileges which are denied to other similar properties;
(4)
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare and safety;
(5)
The special circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant;
(6)
The variance, if granted, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief from the identified hardship and will represent the least deviation possible from the zoning regulation and from the comprehensive plan; and
(7)
The variance is not a request to increase the allowable square footage of sign area, to increase the total number of signs allowed, or to increase the maximum allowable total sign square footage allowed per site.
(c)
Appeals from the decision of the Hearings Board shall follow the appeals procedure set forth in the zoning code for appeals from decisions of the Hearings Board.
(Ord. of 4-3-2007, § 1; Ord. of 4-7-2009, § 26)
Sec. 7-4-22. - Permits.
(a)
Permits required. Except for signs exempted from permitting under this chapter, it shall be unlawful for any person to erect, repair, alter, replace or relocate within Athens-Clarke County any sign, as defined in this chapter, without first obtaining a sign permit from the Director of Building Inspections and making payment scheduled for the same. This requirement does not include routine maintenance of a sign or change of message on a lawfully erected sign. All signs shall, in addition, be subject to the applicable provisions of the building code and the electrical code and any permit fees required thereunder. A permit shall be required for each incidence of temporary sign usage.
In addition, all applications for sign permits must be submitted by an individual(s) with 51 or more percent ownership in fee simple of subject property or his legal agent in writing over the owner's signature.
Notwithstanding any provisions in this chapter concerning the location of signs, signs shall be permitted in the future right-of-way only if the applicant acknowledges in writing that:
(1)
Athens-Clarke County shall not be financially responsible for any sign erected within the future right-of-way; and
(2)
The applicant waives all claims to compensation on the part of the sign owner should the acquisition of the future right-of-way become necessary by Athens-Clarke County.
(b)
Illuminated graphic/approved by electrical inspector. The application for a permit for any sign in which electrical wiring and connections are to be used shall be submitted to the electrical inspector. The electrical inspector shall examine the plans and specifications respecting all wiring and connections to determine if the same complies with the electrical code of Athens-Clarke County and he shall approve the permit within the time limit for the sign permit approval if the plans and specifications comply with the Code. All illuminated signs shall conform to any nationally-recognized testing laboratory (NRTL) standard.
(c)
Application for sign permit. Applications for sign permits shall be made upon application forms provided by the building official and shall contain or have attached thereto the following information:
(1)
Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant;
(2)
Address of building, structure, or lot to which or upon which the sign is to be attached or erected;
(3)
Position of the sign in relation to nearby buildings, structures, or property lines;
(4)
One accurate scale drawing of the plans, specifications, and method of construction and attachment to the building or ground for the sign, as well as a scale drawing of the site showing drives, structures, all existing ground and wall signs, including their size(s) and height(s) and any other limiting site features;
(5)
Name or person, firm, corporation, or association erecting the structure;
(6)
Any electrical permit required and issued for said sign;
(7)
Application for a certificate of appropriateness where applicable; and
(8)
Authorization by owner, if applicable, or by owner's authorized agent.
(d)
Permit issued if application is in order; time for consideration.
(1)
It shall be the duty of the building official, upon the filing of an application for a sign permit, to examine such plans and specifications and other data and the premises upon which it is proposed to erect the sign, and if it shall appear that the proposed structure is in compliance with all the requirements of this chapter, upon final inspection of the sign all applications meeting the requirements of this chapter shall be granted. If an application fails to meet the requirements of this chapter, the denial shall be in writing and shall identify the requirements that are not met by the application. Any application rejected for incompleteness shall identify the reasons further action cannot be taken. If the work authorized under a sign permit has not been started within six months after date of issuance, the permit shall become null and void and a new permit shall be required.
(2)
All sign permit applications shall be granted, denied or rejected for incompleteness within 45 days of the building official's actual receipt of a completed application and the payment of the permit fee. The building official or designee shall give notice to the applicant of the decision by hand delivery or by mailing a notice to the address on the permit application on or before the 45 th day after receipt of the completed application and payment. If mailed, the notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the date of mailing in conformity with this section. If the building official fails to act by granting, denying or rejecting the application within the 45-business day period, the permit shall be deemed to have been denied.
(e)
Vouchers for billboards. Upon proof of ownership of a billboard face or structure and upon proof of removal of such billboard face or structure, the billboard owner will receive a voucher permitting said billboard owner to replace such billboard face or structure in accordance with all applicable provisions of this Chapter. A voucher shall become void one (1) year after its issuance or upon issuance of a permit to construct a replacement billboard face or structure, whichever occurs first. Upon issuance of a permit to construct a replacement billboard face or structure, the person or entity receiving the permit must completely construct the billboard within six (6) months of issuance or said permit shall become void.
(f)
Appeal. A person whose permit application has been denied may appeal the decision to the Administrative Hearing Officer in writing within ten days of the date of the denial pursuant to the provisions of section 1-5-1. The appeal hearing must be set to occur within 45 calendar days of the filing of the written appeal.
(g)
Permit fees. The permit fee for signs shall be based on the cost of administering the sign permit program, inspecting signs and enforcing the sign regulations as established by the Mayor and Commission by resolution. The permit fee for each permanent sign shall be $75.00 plus $10.00 per $1,000.00 of the total cost of each sign. The fee for each temporary sign shall be $30.00. The money collected from these permit fees shall be kept in a fund to be used for sign inspection, regulation, and enforcement.
(Ord. of 4-3-2007, § 1; Ord. of 4-7-2009, § 27; Ord. of 6-4-2013, § 10; Ord. of 11-6-2018(2), § 2 )

(b)
Severability where less speech results. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above in subsection (a), or elsewhere in this chapter, this code, or any adopting ordinance, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this chapter is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this chapter, even if such severability would result in a situation where there would be less speech, whether by subjecting previously exempt signs to permitting or otherwise.
(c)
Severability of provisions pertaining to prohibited signs. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above in subsection (a), or elsewhere in this chapter, this code, or any adopting ordinance, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division or any other law is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this chapter that pertains to prohibited signs, including specifically those signs and sign-types prohibited and not allowed under section 7-4-6 of this chapter. Furthermore, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of section 7-4-6 is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of section 7-4-6.
