Former ch. 5-4, §§ 5-4-1—5-4-16, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from an ordinance adopted Sept. 1, 1992, § 1; and an ordinance adopted Dec. 5, 2000.

ARTICLE I. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT[6]

Footnotes:
--- (6) ---
Editor's note— An ordinance of October 3, 2006, § 1, amended the Code by dividing ch. 5-4 into two articles and adding the title for art. I. Additionally, the term "chapter" has been changed to "article" throughout art. I.

Sec. 5-4-1. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(2)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state to the maximum extent practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(3)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(4)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(5)
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, with the county's greenspace program, parks and greenway network plan;
(6)
Encourage the advantages of urban and brownfield redevelopment and adaptive re-use to reduce the loss of natural areas and open space elsewhere and avoid the need for additional infrastructure to support new development. Follow guidance in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and the Transportation and Public Works Department Technical Standards to utilize legal mechanisms to allow more land to be left in a natural state by using incentives or regulatory measures to promote infill and redevelopment in areas already served by infrastructures;
(7)
Encourage the development within existing urbanized areas on or between previously developed land that is currently underutilized, such as degraded parking lots or shopping centers;
(8)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety or to the integrity of downstream water resources; and
(9)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

Sec. 5-4-7. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria.
(a)
The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article:
(1)
Water quality and runoff reduction. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
a.
For projects with a stormwater concept meeting before December 6, 2020, the system is designed to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, which is defined as the runoff volume resulting from the first 1.2 inches of rainfall from a site, or it retains the first 1.0 inch of rainfall onsite using approved runoff reduction methods;
b.
For projects with a stormwater concept meeting on or after December 6, 2020, the stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first 1.0 inch of rainfall on the site, to the maximum extent practicable. The determination by the MS4 that it is infeasible to apply the runoff reduction standard in part or in whole or that an alternate strategy will reduce pollutant loadings from the site to the maximum extent practicable must be documented with the site plan review documents. If the entire 1.0 inch of rainfall cannot be retained onsite using runoff reduction methods, the remaining runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event must be treated to remove at least 80% of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as designed in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual or the Transportation and Public Works Department Technical Standards. Treatment of runoff from hotspots on the site such as fueling stations requires special attention to address the expected pollutants of concern.
c.
Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual or as provided for in the Transportation and Public Works Department Technical Standards; and
d.
Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the Department are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices.
(2)
Stream channel and aquatic habitat protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation with native vegetation of the applicable stream buffer;
b.
Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of all stormwater runoff generated from a site by the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; and
c.
Post development erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. These measures shall take into consideration location and size of outlet control structure.
(3)
Overbank flood protection. Downstream overbank flood protection and property protection shall be provided by controlling the site's post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under section 5-4-7(3) is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided.
(4)
Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the site's 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(5)
Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and any local addenda. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual or the Transportation and Public Works Department Technical Standards, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the Department before being included in the design of a stormwater management system.
Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control.
(6)
Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under section 5-4-7(1). The applicant may, if approved by the Department, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. Credits shall be made available pursuant to the provisions governing credits in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual or as provided for in the Transportation and Public Works Department Technical Standards.
(7)
Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include, but are not limited to, culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way, public properties, and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public right-of-ways. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements:
a.
Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual;
b.
All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and
c.
Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual.
(8)
Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-370 et seq. (the "Georgia Safe Dams Act") and the rules for dam safety promulgated thereunder, as applicable.
(b)
The Transportation and Public Works Director may determine that redevelopment on a developed site that includes all stormwater management measures necessary to satisfy all of the postdevelopment stormwater management performance criteria as provided in section 5-4-7(a) is fully or partially infeasible.
(1)
An applicant for such an infeasibility determination shall provide justification demonstrating how the redevelopment satisfies the Better Site Design and smart growth principles, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual or as provided for in the Transportation and Public Works Department Technical Standards. The Transportation and Public Works Director shall consider the application and existing site conditions to determine full or partial infeasibility on a site by site basis. At least one of the following criteria shall be satisfied:
a.
The redevelopment site is situated on parcel(s) with impervious cover in excess of 40 percent of the maximum allowable lot coverage for the applicable zoning category, as calculated considering only the adjusted tract acreage;
b.
The redevelopment site includes mitigating circumstances including shallow bedrock, contaminated soils, high groundwater, or presence of existing utilities; or
c.
Conformance with post-development stormwater management performance criteria on the redevelopment site would damage a community resource or impact threatened or endangered species habitat.
(2)
Only redevelopment sites that satisfy the following additional criteria will be eligible to be determined partially or fully infeasible for post-development performance criteria as provided in section 5-4-7(a).
a.
The site is situated in an area in the I (Industrial), E (Employment), C (Commercial) or RM (Mixed-Density Residential) zones as designated and established in Title 8, entitled Zoning and Development Standards of this Code together with any churches or schools permitted in any other zone by special use permit;
b.
The site is not classified as a hotspot; and
c.
The site is not upstream of a known public flooding problem as identified by the Department of Transportation and Public Works in the Area-Wide Stormwater Master Plan, as amended from time to time, on file and available for public inspection at the Department of Transportation and Public Works.
(c)
Any site determined to be fully or partially infeasible for post-development performance criteria for post-development performance criteria according to section 5-4-7(b) shall be exempt from satisfying any criteria deemed infeasible by the Transportation and Public Works Director. In such case, and unless otherwise provided for in this article, the following post-development stormwater management performance criteria shall apply at a minimum:
(1)
Existing deficiencies. The following measures to mitigate existing deficiencies on the parcel(s) shall be part of the stormwater management plan.
a.
Existing erosional areas shall be stabilized; and
b.
Existing structural stormwater control(s) shall be restored to conform to the original design or to an alternate design that more closely conforms to current standards.
(2)
Special standards for replaced impervious surface area. All stormwater runoff generated from the replaced impervious surface shall be adequately treated before discharge. A stormwater management system will be presumed to comply with this standard if:
a.
It is designed to treat the REIS volume from the site in a way that minimizes this pollutant loading; and
b.
Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual or as provided for in the Transportation and Public Works Department Technical Standards.
c.
The design shall utilize green infrastructure, low impact design, and runoff reduction to the maximum extent practicable. All stormwater runoff that is either infiltrated or evaporated may be counted as double in treating the REIS volume requirements.
(3)
Reduction of existing impervious surface areas. When the existing impervious surface area of a site is removed and replaced with a predevelopment soil hydrologic equivalent (Type B soil with a curve number equivalent to a meadow or woods in good condition), and a stormwater management permit is obtained for such work under this Chapter, the following standards apply:
a.
If the site's impervious surface is reduced by 20 percent to any given outlet, the requirements of section 5-4-7(c)(2) do not apply.
b.
If the site's impervious surface is reduced by less than 20 percent to any given outlet, the requirements of section 5-4-7(c)(2) are applied in proportion to the amount of impervious surface removed. For example, removal of ten percent of the site's impervious surface area to any given outlet would reduce the requirements of section 5-4-7(c)(2) by 50 percent.
(4)
Additional impervious surface less than 5,000 square feet. Many redevelopment projects involve not only the replacement of impervious surfaces but also the net creation of impervious surfaces. These new surfaces can impact streams and neighboring properties. All stormwater runoff generated from the new impervious surface shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if it is sized to provide treatment as defined in subsection (a)(1) of this section.
(5)
Additional impervious surface greater than 5,000 square feet. If the redevelopment results in a net increase of greater than 5,000 square feet of impervious surface, all stormwater runoff generated from the new impervious surface shall adhere to the post-development stormwater management performance criteria as specified in section 5-4-7(a).
(Ord. of 6-1-2004, § 1; Ord. of 12-5-2017(3), §§ 6—8 ; Ord. of 2-5-2019(1), § 8 ; Ord. of 4-7-2020, §§ 5—8 )
Sec. 5-4-8. - Construction inspections of post-development stormwater management system.
(a)
Inspections to ensure plan compliance during construction. Periodic inspections of the stormwater management system construction shall be conducted by the staff of the Department or conducted and certified by a professional engineer who has been approved by the Department.

(4)
Any other variations or violations of the conditions of the approved stormwater management plan.
If any violations are found, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions.
(b)
Final inspection and as-built plans. Upon completion of a project and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant is responsible for certifying that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan. All applicants are required to submit actual "as built" plans for any stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices and must be certified by a professional engineer. A final inspection by the Department is required before the release of any performance securities can occur.
(Ord. of 6-1-2004, § 1)
Sec. 5-4-9. - Ongoing inspection and maintenance of stormwater facilities and practices.
(a)
Long-term maintenance inspection of stormwater facilities and practices. Stormwater management facilities and practices included in a stormwater management plan which are subject to an inspection and maintenance agreement must undergo ongoing inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of the agreement, the plan and this article.
A stormwater management facility or practice shall be inspected on a periodic basis by the responsible person in accordance with the approved inspection and maintenance agreement. In the event that the stormwater management facility has not been maintained and/or becomes a danger to public safety or public health, or threatens downstream water resources, the Department shall notify the person responsible for carrying out the maintenance plan by registered or certified mail to the person specified in the inspection and maintenance agreement. The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the agreement and the plan and shall specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. If the responsible person fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the Department may correct the violation as provided in subsection 5-4-9(d) hereof.
Inspection programs by the Department may be established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in stormwater management facilities; and evaluating the condition of stormwater management facilities and practices.
(b)
Right-of-entry for inspection. The terms of the inspection and maintenance agreement shall provide for the Department to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property for general inspections or when the Department has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this article is occurring or has occurred and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this article.
(c)
Records of maintenance activities. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall provide records of all maintenance and repairs to the Department.
(d)
Failure to maintain. If a responsible person fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the Department, after 30 days' written notice by certified mail (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24 hours' notice shall be sufficient), may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance requirements by performing the necessary work to place the facility or practice in proper working condition. The costs of the repair work shall be billed to the owner(s) of the facility. Failure of the owner(s) to pay the costs within 30 days of receipt of the bill shall result in 1.5 percent late charge on the unpaid balance of any bill that becomes delinquent. Suits for collection shall be commenced by Athens-Clarke County in the county of the owner's residence; provided, however, if the owner is not a resident of this state, suit may be filed in the Superior Court of Athens-Clarke County.

ARTICLE II. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION

Sec. 5-4-20. - General provisions.
(a)
Title. This article shall be known as the "Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection Ordinance."
(b)
Findings. It is hereby determined that:
(1)
The Athens-Clarke County separate storm sewer system as defined in this article was designed and installed to manage stormwater so as to prevent localized flooding, damage to property and risk to public safety;
(2)
The Athens-Clarke County separate storm sewer system was not designed or installed as a receiving system for non-stormwater discharges;
(3)
Discharges to the Athens-Clarke County separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
(4)
These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the county separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments;
(5)
These non-stormwater discharges not only impact local waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters;
(6)
The impacts of these non-stormwater discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
(7)
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the Athens-Clarke County separate storm sewer system;
(8)
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of non-point source pollution caused by non-stormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system;
(9)
The Clean Water Act requires the management and maintenance of the Athens-Clarke County separate storm sewer system and the management of discharges to that system;
(10)
Therefore, in order to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the Athens-Clarke County separate storm sewer system, it is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the Athens-Clarke County separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
