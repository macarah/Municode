Athens-Clarke County's right of revision. Athens-Clarke County reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in section 5-1-1 of this chapter or the general and specific prohibitions in section 5-1-2(c) of this chapter.
(k)
Special agreement. Athens-Clarke County reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. However, the industrial user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. The user may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from EPA. Such a request will be approved only if the industrial user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard. An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.
(l)
Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The public utilities director may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

(b)
Additional pretreatment measures:
(1)
Meat packing plant requirements. No meat packing or allied products plants shall discharge waste or water into the POTW unless the following conditions are met:
a.
There shall be a separation of domestic wastewater from the bathrooms and the packing wastewater. The domestic wastewater from all bathrooms may be emptied directly into the POTW. If there are floor drains in the bathroom area, these drains must be so arranged that no byproducts of production can be emptied directly or indirectly into them.
b.
All meat packing wastewater, before entering the POTW, must pass through a 30 divisions per inch by 20 divisions per inch mesh vibrating screen or a device that will provide a complete separation of feathers, hair, offal and other packing byproducts. All floor drains or outside drains in pits shall be so connected that they will go through this screening process and no traps left available where covers may be raised and feathers, hair, offal and other packing byproducts emptied to go into the POTW without first going through these screens.
c.
All plants shall furnish at their expense a layout showing the arrangement of their wastewater piping or troughs to be approved by Athens-Clarke County.
d.
If sufficient fall is not available at the packing plants for effective screening, then a system of pumping of the wastewater to provide the screening must be provided at the owner's expense to adequately accomplish the screening.
e.
All meat processors not covered under this meat packing section will be subject to the provisions of section 5-1-2(i).
(2)
Control of discharge. As a result of upset to the POTW (existing or potential), the public utilities director may require a user to restrict its discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from process wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
(3)
Sand interceptors. Sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the public utilities director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All sand interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the public utilities director and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the owner at his expense.
(4)
Flammable substances. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
(d)
Tenant responsibility. Where an owner of property leases premises to any other person as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if either the owner or the tenant is an user, either or both may be held responsible for compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
(e)
Hauled wastewater:
(1)
Septic tank waste may be accepted into the POTW at a designated receiving structure within the treatment plant area, and at such times as are established by the public utilities director, provided such wastes do not cause the WRF to violate its permit, fail a toxicity test, or cause interference or pass through. Wastewater discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such facilities shall be issued by the public utilities director.
(2)
The discharge of hauled industrial wastes requires prior approval and a wastewater discharge permit from Athens-Clarke County. Only wastes generated within Athens-Clarke County will be accepted. The public utilities director shall have authority to prohibit the disposal of such waste if such disposal would interfere with the treatment plant operation. Waste haulers are subject to all other sections of this chapter. A manifest system will be utilized for each truckload of industrial waste to document where the industrial waste was generated.

The public utilities director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under subsection 5-1-4(h) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under subsection 5-1-5(d).
(3)
No user shall implement the planned changed condition(s) until and unless the public utilities director has responded in writing to the user's notice.
(4)
For purposes of this requirement flow increases of 10 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be deemed significant.
(f)
Reports of potential problems:
(1)
In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems for the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in subsection 5-1-2(c) of this chapter), it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify Athens-Clarke County of the incident. This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
(2)
Within five (5) business days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the public utilities director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter.
(3)
Failure to notify Athens-Clarke County of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this chapter.
(4)
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph 1, above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, agents or representatives of users, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(g)
Reports from nonsignificant users. All users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to Athens-Clarke County as the public utilities director may require.
(h)
Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the Athens-Clarke County public utilities department within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the public utilities department within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the POTW performs monitoring at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the POTW performs sampling between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling.
(i)
Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste:
(1)
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under subsection (e) above. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (a), (c), and (d).
(2)
Users are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (l) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(3)
In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 calendar days of the effective date of such regulations.
(4)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(j)
Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
(k)
Sample collection:
(1)
Except as indicated in subsection 2 below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the public utilities director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or through a minimum of eight (8) grab samples of equal volume where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
(2)
Samples for FOG, temperature, pH, cyanide, toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab collection techniques. For volatile parameters, specifically cyanide, grab samples shall be collected using EPA-approved techniques that prevent loss of volatile pollutants. Individual grab samples may be analyzed separately, allowing calculation of a single composite result. Alternatively, a single composite sample may be prepared for analysis using EPA-approved techniques that prevent loss of volatile pollutants.
(l)
Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date post-marked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(m)
Record keeping. Users shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records and information required to be retained under this chapter. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance with this chapter, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the public utilities director.
( Ord. of 10-2-2018(1), § 1 )
Sec. 5-1-7. - Compliance monitoring.
(a)
Inspection and sampling. Athens-Clarke County shall have the right to enter the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter, and any permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the user is complying with all requirements thereof. Users shall allow the public utilities director or representative ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, taking photographs, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
(1)
Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from Athens-Clarke County, EPD, and EPA will be permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
(2)
Athens-Clarke County, EPD and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
(3)
Athens-Clarke County may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated per the manufacturer's specifications, but no less than semiannually to ensure their accuracy.
(4)
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the user's facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the request of the public utilities director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
(5)
Unreasonable delays in allowing Athens-Clarke County personnel access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
(6)
Where Athens-Clarke County holds an easement, duly authorized employees of Athens-Clarke County bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which Athens-Clarke County holds a duly negotiated easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of the POTW lying within the easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on the easement shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private property involved.
(7)
While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in this section, duly authorized employees of Athens-Clarke County shall observe all reasonable safety rules applicable to the premises established by the Owner.
(b)
Search warrants. If the public utilities director has been refused access to a building, structure or property or any part thereof, and if the public utilities director has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of Athens-Clarke County designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Athens-Clarke County Attorney shall prepare an application for any local law enforcement official to obtain a search warrant from the judge of the Municipal Court of Athens-Clarke County describing therein the specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if anything, may be searched and/or seized on the property described. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the law enforcement officer who obtained same in the company of the public utilities director.
( Ord. of 10-2-2018(1), § 1 )
Sec. 5-1-8. - Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from Athens-Clarke County inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the public utilities director and in accordance with the Georgia Open Records Act, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information or as a trade secret and will be available to the public without restriction.
( Ord. of 10-2-2018(1), § 1 )
Sec. 5-1-9. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
Athens-Clarke County shall publish annually, in the largest general circulation newspaper published in Athens-Clarke County, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean:
(1)
Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
(2)
Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, FOG, TKN and TP, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
(3)
Any other discharge violation that Athens-Clarke County believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of Athens-Clarke County personnel or the general public);
(4)
Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in Athens-Clarke County's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5)
Failure to meet, within 90 calendar days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
(6)
Failure to provide within 30-calendar days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
(7)
Failure to accurately report noncompliance;
(8)
Any other violation(s) which Athens-Clarke County determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
( Ord. of 10-2-2018(1), § 1 )
Sec. 5-1-10. - Administrative enforcement remedies.
(a)
Notification of violation. Whenever the public utilities director finds that any user has violated or is violating this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the public utilities director or his agent may serve upon said user a written Notice of Violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the public utilities director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of Athens-Clarke County to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.
(b)
Consent orders. The public utilities director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent Orders shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) below and shall be judicially enforceable.
(c)
Show cause hearing. The public utilities director may order any user which causes or contributes to violation(s) of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the public utilities director and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
(d)
Compliance orders. When the public utilities director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate the ordinance, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within 20 calendar days. If the user does not come into compliance within 20 calendar days, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established or a federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order release the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.
(e)
Cease and desist orders. When the public utilities director finds that a user is violating this chapter, the user's wastewater discharge permit, any order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the public utilities director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
(1)
Immediately comply with all requirements.
(2)
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.
(f)
Administrative fines:
(1)
Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, any user that is found to have violated any provision of this chapter, its wastewater discharge permit, and orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(2)
Assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge and the public utilities director shall have such other collection remedies as may be available for other service charges and fees.
(3)
Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the public utilities director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 30 calendar days of being notified of the fine. The public utilities director shall convene a hearing on the matter within 30 calendar days of receiving the request from the user. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment together with any interest accruing thereto shall be returned to the user. Athens-Clarke County may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions such as notices and orders to the fine.
(4)
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
(g)
Emergency suspensions. The public utilities director may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The public utilities director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
(1)
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the public utilities director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The public utilities director shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of Athens-Clarke County that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in subsection (h) are initiated against the user.
(2)
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the public utilities director, prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsections (c) and (h).
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(h)
Termination of discharge. In addition to those provisions in subsection 5-1-5(f) of this chapter, any user that violates the following conditions of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, is subject to discharge termination.
(1)
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.
(2)
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge.
(3)
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge.
(4)
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
(5)
Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 5-1-2 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (c) of this section why the proposed action should not be taken.
( Ord. of 10-2-2018(1), § 1 )
Sec. 5-1-11. - Judicial enforcement remedies.
(a)
Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the public utilities director may petition the Superior Court of Athens-Clarke County through the Athens-Clarke County Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or the requirement imposed by this chapter or activities of the user. Such other action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief may also be sought by Athens-Clarke County. A petition for injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite to taking any other action against a user.
(b)
Criminal prosecution:
(1)
Any user or representative thereof that willfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter, any orders or wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months or both.
(2)
Any user or representative thereof that willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of an offense and be subject to a penalty of at least $1,000.00 and/or be subject to imprisonment for six (6) months. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
(3)
Any user or representative thereof that knowingly makes or causes to make any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater discharge permit or order, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months or both.
(c)
Remedies nonexclusive. The provisions in sections 5-1-9 through 5-1-12 are not exclusive remedies. The public utilities director reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with Athens-Clarke County's enforcement response plan. However, Athens-Clarke County reserves the right to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the public utilities director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.
( Ord. of 10-2-2018(1), § 1 )
Sec. 5-1-12. - Supplemental enforcement action.
(a)
Performance bonds. The public utilities director may decline to reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this chapter, any orders, or a previous wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to Athens-Clarke County, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the public utilities director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
(b)
Liability insurance. The public utilities director may decline to reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this chapter, any order, or a previous wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, unless such user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurance sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
(c)
Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, orders, or wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(d)
Public nuisances. Any violation of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits, FOG requirements, or orders issued hereunder, is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the public utilities director in accordance with applicable Georgia law or Athens-Clarke County ordinance. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of Section 3-13-14, Section 5-2-50(b), Chapter 5-4 Article II and this Sewer Use Ordinance, including the reimbursement of Athens-Clarke County for any costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance.
( Ord. of 10-2-2018(1), § 1 )
Sec. 5-1-13. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
(a)
Upset:
(1)
For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical or local pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(2)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (3) are met.
(3)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
a.
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
b.
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures;
c.
The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) business days):
1.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance.
2.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue.
3.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5)
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(6)
The user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(b)
General/specific prohibitions. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in subsection 5-1-2 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: (a) a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference, or (b) no local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when Athens-Clarke County was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(c)
Bypass:
(1)
a.
"Bypass" means the intentional or unintentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
b.
"Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this section.
(3)
a.
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least 10 business days before the date of the bypass if possible.
b.
A user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) business days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(4)
Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless
a.
The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
b.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment equipment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance;
c.
The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (3) of this section.
(5)
The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (4) of this section.

All revenues received from the wastewater system connection fee shall only be used for debt service payments for capital improvements or deposited into the Athens-Clarke County's water and sewer construction fund for construction and purchase of capital improvements.
( Ord. of 10-2-2018(1), § 1 )
Secs. 5-1-29—5-1-41. - Reserved.
Sec. 5-1-42. - Sewer user charges—System for determination generally.
(a)
Liability for surcharge, determination of total charge, establishing rate. No person shall discharge or empty any water or waste into the wastewater collection and treatment system of Athens-Clarke County with a concentration in excess of the domestic wastewater concentrations stated in Table 5-1-2(f) without paying the surcharge on sewer user charges imposed under this title. The surcharge assessment will only be based on the concentration in excess of the domestic wastewater concentrations stated in Table 5-1-2(f). The total sewer user charge would then be the normal sewer user charge plus the surcharge. The rates of both the user charge and surcharge shall be established by the public utilities director subject to approval in an ordinance by the mayor and commission.
(b)
User charge rate criterion. The minimum criterion for establishment of the user charge rate shall be to recover the annual operation and maintenance cost inclusive of the capital accrual and replacement costs for providing collection and treatment of domestic wastewater. Said operations and maintenance portion of the rate shall be evaluated within a reasonable time prior to the end of each year. If the operation and maintenance portion of the revenues exceeds the operation and maintenance portion of the expenses, said excess revenues shall be credited toward the next year's operation and maintenance portion of the wastewater user's charge.
(c)
Surcharge rate criterion. The minimum criterion for establishment of the surcharge rate shall be to recover the additional annual operation and maintenance cost for providing collection and treatment of wastewaters in excess of domestic wastewater concentrations.
(d)
Determining persons liable for surcharge. The public utilities director shall determine which users are discharging waters or waste to the wastewater collection and treatment system in excess of acceptable levels. This shall be accomplished by sections 5-1-6 and 5-1-7 and the wastewater monitoring program conducted by the public utilities department.
(e)
Billing, payment of surcharge. The surcharge shall be billed monthly by the water business office with the normal user charge, and the conditions for payment and penalties applicable to the normal user charge shall apply to the surcharge.
(f)
Unacceptable wastes not subject to surcharge. There shall be no surcharge provisions for toxic pollutants in excess of concentrations defined in sections 5-1-2(c), 5-1-2(d), and 5-1-2(e). This decision is based on the fact that the POTW is not designed to facilitate the removal of the items referred to in this section. Any person in violation of this subsection shall be subject to the provisions set out in sections 5-1-9 through 5-1-12.
( Ord. of 10-2-2018(1), § 1 )
Sec. 5-1-43. - Sewer user charges—Rates; billing and collection; security deposits.
(a)
Calculation, applicability of monthly volumetric rate charge. The volumetric rate shall be a cost per unit of wastewater volume. This rate shall be multiplied times the volume of wastewater returned to the sanitary sewer each month by the user. The base volumetric charge shall be applicable to all user classes. In the absence of empirical wastewater flow measurement by meters established for the sole purpose of measuring wastewater flow volume, the wastewater volume shall equal the volume of water usage measured by the water meter serving the premises which discharge to the POTW.
(b)
Sewer rates established. Users shall pay the rates as set forth in section 5-3-80 of this Code.
(c)
Calculation of monthly surcharge. The surcharge rate shall be a cost per pound of BOD, TSS, TKN, TP, and FOG. This rate shall be multiplied by the pounds of BOD, TSS, TKN, TP, and FOG discharged to the sanitary sewer each month by the user. The poundage shall be based on that concentration of BOD, TSS, TKN, TP and FOG over and above the domestic wastewater concentrations stated in Table 5-1-2(f) and the volume of wastewater discharged during the month. The results shall be the monthly surcharge.
(d)
Monthly customer service fee. The monthly customer service fee for active accounts shall be as set forth in section 5-3-80 of this Code.
(e)
Determination of volume of wastewater for residential users. A residential user's wastewater volume shall be determined by multiplying the user's monthly water consumption in gallons by 100 percent. Any exception to this requirement shall be in accordance with a policy and procedure adopted by the Mayor and Commission.
For leaks in the user's waterline which result in the additional water volume not being placed in the wastewater collection system, the wastewater portion of the bill shall be adjusted in accordance with a policy and procedure statement adopted by the Mayor and Commission.
The user may install an outdoor water use meter under the same rules and conditions as all meters connected to the waterworks system for use exclusively for outdoor water uses where none of the water would be returned to the sanitary sewer system, and no sewer charge would be made on this meter. The water used on the original meter measuring household use would continue to be charged for wastewater usage at 100 percent of the water volume.
(f)
Determination of volume of wastewater for non-residential customers. Nonresidential user's wastewater volume shall be determined by taking 100 percent of the user's monthly water consumption in gallons. This percentage shall be reduced if the user provides written proof acceptable to the public utilities director that less than 100 percent of the user's water consumption is returned to the sanitary sewer. If the public utilities director accepts such proof, then the reduced percentage figure shall be used to determine the user's monthly wastewater volume.
(g)
Charging system users not utilizing Athens-Clarke County water. Any wastewater system user having as its source of water a supply other than that owned and operated by Athens-Clarke County shall be subject to the charges established in this section. That user shall also install a water meter, approved by the public utilities director, in the user's water supply line between the source and the building or buildings where the water usage occurs and the wastewater discharge originates. A wastewater system user of this type shall be required to pay the base and surcharges described above. The wastewater volumes shall be determined in accordance with a policy and procedure statement adopted by the Mayor and Commission. The provisions of this Code applicable to the installation of water meters, reading of meters, billing, penalties, and termination of service for water shall apply to the meters and charges prescribed by this subsection.
(h)
Late payment of bills. For failure of any user of the wastewater system to pay user charges when due, the user shall be subject to the penalties presently authorized, or that may be authorized in the future, by the Mayor and Commission for the failure to pay a water bill when due.
(i)
Reinstatement of service. Any property owner whose sewer service by Athens-Clarke County shall have been disconnected pursuant to the provisions of this section shall have such sewer service reinstated upon compliance with the provisions of this article and upon the payment to Athens-Clarke County of a reinstatement fee covering all costs for restoration of sewer service, but not less than an amount specified in section 5-3-83 of this Code.
(1)
Security deposits. In the case of mobile home parks, apartments, townhouses, motels or hotels, dwelling units or condominium complexes organized under the provisions of the Apartment Ownership Act or similar act of the General Assembly, the director of finance shall cause or require a security deposit as provided in section 5-3-74 of this Code. A deposit may also be required of any customer that has a record of delinquency for payment of sewer or water accounts or taxes due the county, bankruptcy, insolvency, where a foreclosure proceeding is pending with respect to property served, or where there is a reasonable likelihood that the account would not be paid. The deposit shall be paid at such times and in such amounts as may be specified by the director of finance. A bond with approved security, or other guarantee of payment, may be accepted in lieu of any security deposit.
( Ord. of 10-2-2018(1), § 1 )
Sec. 5-1-44. - Miscellaneous provisions.
(a)
Pipeline construction parallel to existing sewers. No person shall lay any main pipe for gas, water or sewage, or conduit for any purpose in any street, within four feet on each side of the centerline of any sewer unless with the permission of the public utilities director.
(b)
Transportation of liquid waste over highways. Liquid wastes or byproducts transported over highways or public roads or streets of Athens-Clarke County shall be in watertight and completely covered containers or vehicles.
( Ord. of 10-2-2018(1), § 1 )
Sec. 5-1-45. - Fats, oils, and grease management.
(a)
Purpose and policy. This section establishes uniform registration, maintenance and monitoring requirements for controlling the discharge of FOG from food service facilities discharging into the POTW. The purpose of this section augments the purpose and policy of Section 5-1-1, with emphasis on the following:
(1)
To prevent the introduction of excessive amounts of FOG into the POTW; and
(2)
To prevent clogging or blocking of the sanitary sewer system due to grease accumulation. FOG accumulation causes potential sewage backup which can result in overflows which violate NPDES permits, illicit discharges, nuisance conditions, damages to private or public property, loss of business, or flooding of streets, residences, and commercial buildings, all of which impair the public health, safety and welfare.
(b)
Definitions. The following definitions supplement those in section 5-1-1(c).
(1)
Food service establishment: Any facility that prepares and/or packages food or beverages for sale or consumption, on or off site, with the exception of private residences. Food service facilities shall include, but are not limited to, food courts, food manufacturers, food packagers, restaurants, cafeterias, grocery stores, bakeries, lounges, hospitals, hotels, nursing homes, schools, and all other food service facilities not otherwise listed.
(2)
Garbage disposal: A device which shreds or grinds up waste materials into smaller portions for discharge into the POTW.
(3)
Grease transporter: A person who collects the contents of a grease interceptor and transports it to an approved recycling or disposal facility.
(4)
Grease interceptor: A device located either a) underground and outside or b) inside a food service facility, designed to separate and retain food wastes and grease from the waste stream while allowing the balance of the liquid waste to discharge to the POTW.
(5)
Grease removal system: A system consisting of one or more grease interceptors, including ancillary components.
(c)
Applicability. This section shall apply to all food service establishments that are connected to the POTW, including those connected to privately-owned upstream collection systems.
(d)
Grease removal systems.
(1)
Requirements. Food service establishments that discharge to the POTW are required to have a grease removal system. The requirements in this section are in addition to any applicable code requirements. In the event of conflict, the more stringent standard shall govern.
a.
New food service establishments. On or after the effective date of this section, food service establishments which are newly proposed or constructed, or existing establishments which will be expanded or renovated to include a food service facility where such did not previously exist, shall be required to install, operate, and maintain a grease interceptor according to the requirements contained in this section.
1.
At any food service establishment, indoor grease interceptors may be used upstream of underground outdoor grease interceptors. However, an underground outdoor grease interceptor is required unless, due to space limitations, the public utilities director authorizes an indoor grease interceptor to be installed.
2.
Grease interceptors shall be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
b.
Existing food service establishments. For the purposes of sizing and installation of grease interceptors, all food service establishments existing prior to the effective date of this section shall be permitted to operate and maintain existing grease interceptors provided these grease interceptors are in efficient operating condition as demonstrated by compliance with the FOG concentration limit stated in Table 5-1-2(f).
c.
The public utilities director may require an existing food service establishment to install, operate, and maintain a grease interceptor that complies with the requirements of this section or to modify or repair any noncompliant plumbing or existing interceptor within 90 days of written notification by the public utilities director when any one or more of the following conditions exist.
1.
The food service establishment is found to be contributing FOG in quantities sufficient to cause line blockages, partial blockages or necessitate increased maintenance of the POTW.
2.
The food service establishment does not have a grease interceptor.
3.
The food service establishment has an undersized, irreparable, or defective grease interceptor, as determined by the Athens-Clarke County public utilities department.
4.
Remodeling of the food preparation or kitchen waste plumbing system is performed which requires a plumbing permit to be issued by the Athens-Clarke County Building Permits and Inspection Department.
5.
The existing food service establishment does not have plumbing connections to a grease interceptor in compliance with the requirements of this section.
(2)
Plumbing connections. Grease interceptors shall be located in the food service establishment's lateral sewer line downstream of all fixtures which may introduce grease, and upstream of the facility's connection to the POTW. Such fixtures shall include, but are not limited to, sinks, dishwashers, garbage disposals, automatic hood wash units, floor drains in food preparation and storage areas, and any other fixture which is determined to be a potential source of fats, oils or grease. Wastewater from sanitary facilities and other similar fixtures shall not be introduced into a grease interceptor under any circumstances.
(3)
Design. Grease removal systems shall be designed in accordance with all applicable requirements of the International Plumbing Code (latest edition). Mechanically operated grease interceptors may not be used. Outdoor underground grease interceptors shall have a minimum capacity of 1,500 gallons, two compartments and shall be capable of separation and retention of grease and settleable solids. Interceptor design shall conform to the requirements of the state plumbing code. A control manhole over each compartment for monitoring purposes shall be required and installed at the user's sole expense. Covers shall have a gas-tight fit. The grease interceptor shall be designed, constructed and installed for adequate load-bearing capacity. Flow control devices shall be required where the water flow through the interceptor could otherwise exceed its rated flow. Interceptors shall be installed in a location outside of the building which provides easy access at all times for inspection, cleaning and proper maintenance, including pumping. If space limitations do not permit an outdoor grease interceptor, indoor interceptors may be used with a minimum capacity of 40 pounds.
Grease removal system designs will be reviewed by the public utilities director as part of a plumbing permit application. In the permit application, the user shall furnish complete information about the food service facility, including description of operations (amount and type of food prepared); hours of operation; number of seats; number, type, and capacities of fixtures that produce grease; and description and capacity of proposed grease separation system components. The application shall include calculations that demonstrate conformance with applicable design standards.
(4)
Installation. Grease removal systems shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. To allow for observation, sampling and measurement of wastewaters, a sampling point on the effluent discharge side of the grease interceptor shall be provided at the owner's expense. The sampling point shall be maintained and kept safe and accessible to Athens-Clarke County personnel at all times.
(5)
Maintenance. All costs for maintenance of grease removal systems are the responsibility of the user. Grease removal systems shall be maintained so as to be in continuously efficient operation. Outdoor grease interceptor maintenance shall be performed at intervals of not less than once every three months. Indoor grease interceptor maintenance shall be performed at intervals of not less than once every four weeks. However, food service establishments that serve or prepare 500 to 1,000 servings per month may be serviced not less than every six months and those serving fewer than 500 servings per month may be serviced not less than every twelve months. All maintenance frequencies above are contingent on the interceptor discharge concentrations not exceeding permissible FOG concentrations stated in Table 5-1-2(f).
a.
Additives. It is specifically prohibited to use any additive including, but not limited to, enzymes, chemicals, or bacteria as a substitute for or in conjunction with grease removal system maintenance.
b.
Waste removal. The user shall be responsible for the proper removal and legal disposal of the grease waste per EPD Rule 391-3-6-.24 Regulation of Commercial Waste Originators, Pumpers, Transporters, Processors, and Disposal Facilities. Grease interceptors shall be serviced by a state registered transporter, and a completed manifest shall be kept on site by the user for every service event. Cleaning and maintenance of grease interceptors shall include the complete removal of all contents, including solids and liquids, including from the tank walls, baffles, cross pipes, inlets and outlets, two tee's, and the cover. Top skimming, decanting, or back flushing of the grease interceptor is prohibited. Further, the discharge of liquid, semi-solids, or solids into a grease interceptor from vehicles after servicing is prohibited. Vehicles capable of separating water from grease shall not discharge separated water into the grease interceptor, or POTW.
c.
Waste disposal. Grease waste shall not be disposed of to the POTW or stormwater collection system. All grease waste shall be tracked by an Athens-Clarke County approved three-part manifest, and the waste shall be disposed of at a facility permitted and approved to receive such waste.
d.
Manifest transmittal. The user shall maintain a legible copy of the completed three-part manifest on site for each service event for a period of at least three years. Failure to provide all manifests for review by Athens-Clarke County may result in a fine.
(6)
Repairs. All costs for repair of grease removal systems are the responsibility of the user. The food service facility shall be responsible for scheduling all repairs to its grease removal system. Repairs required by Athens-Clarke County shall be completed within 30 calendar days after the date of written notice of required repairs is received by the facility, unless the public utilities director approves in writing a different schedule.
(7)
Inspection. Athens-Clarke County may inspect grease removal systems as necessary to confirm that proper efficiency of the grease removal system is being achieved.
a.
Entry. Each food service establishment shall allow Athens-Clarke County personnel access at reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, observation, records examination, measurement, sampling, and testing in accordance with the provisions of this section. This includes the taking of photographs to document conditions. The refusal of any food service establishment to allow Athens-Clarke County personnel entry to or upon the facility's premises for the purposes listed shall constitute a violation of this section.
b.
Monitoring. Athens-Clarke County personnel shall have the right to sample and analyze the wastewater from any food service establishment at any time to determine levels of FOG contained within a facility's discharge.
c.
Failed inspection. If a grease interceptor fails the initial inspection, the inspector may notify the user that the grease interceptor shall be cleaned out within seven calendar days. After seven calendar days, the grease interceptor should be re-inspected.
d.
Failed re-inspection. If at the first re-inspection, the grease interceptor is found to be in non-compliance, a notice of violation may be issued, and the user may be told that the grease interceptor shall be cleaned immediately. After three weekdays, the grease interceptor may be re-inspected.
(8)
Recordkeeping. It shall be a violation of this section for a user to allow the removal of its grease interceptor waste without documentation using an approved three-part manifest. The user shall be responsible for maintaining a copy of these manifests on site for a period of three years and subject to Athens-Clarke County's review without prior notification. The manifest shall contain the information listed below:
a.
Food Service Establishment:
Facility name, address, and telephone number
Interceptor type and size
Date and volume removed from the interceptor
Authorized signature (verifying the grease interceptor was cleaned and in operable condition)
b.
