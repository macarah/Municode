Sec. 9-17-1. Generally.

Sec. 9-17-1. - Generally.
Utility substations are allowed in any zoning district, with the exception of residential districts. When located in a residential district, the use is permitted if located on a parcel that is one-quarter acre or less, but shall require a special use permit if located on a parcel greater than one-quarter acre. When located in an office, commercial, or industrial district, the size of the parcel is unlimited. Such use, regardless of district, shall be secured within a building or shall be completely fenced with locked gate(s) to a height of eight feet; shall not involve the storage of vehicles or service equipment; shall be surrounded by a five-foot-wide vegetative screen, at least six feet in height within a three-year period; and shall be exempt from the minimum lot and width requirements, but shall follow the setback requirements of the district in which it is located. Open areas shall be maintained and free of weeds and debris. Any lighting on the property shall be such that it does not cause glare to occur on adjacent properties or streets. Parcels located within an industrial district shall be exempt from the aforementioned screening requirements.
