Sec. 1-23-1. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Declaration of domestic partnership means a form provided by the Municipal Court in which two people agree to be jointly responsible for the necessities of life incurred during the domestic partnership and that all qualifications for domestic partnership are met when the declaration is signed. The form will require both partners to provide reasonable proof of their primary, regular and permanent residence address. The form must be signed under penalty of perjury and must be witnessed and notarized. The Municipal Court shall, within 30 days of the effective date of this chapter, make such forms available. To help defray costs associated with the providing and filing of these forms, the Municipal Court is authorized to charge a fee as set forth in section 1-23-4 for each completed form.
Domestic partnership means two people of the opposite or same gender who live together in the mutual interdependence of a single home and have signed a declaration of domestic partnership in which they attest that:
(1)
They share the same primary, regular and permanent residence and have lived together for the previous six months (documentation must be submitted verifying joint residency);
(2)
They have a committed personal relationship with each other that is mutually interdependent and intended to be lifelong;
(3)
They agree to be jointly obligated and responsible for the necessities of life for each other;
(4)
They are not married to anyone or legally separated from anyone;
(5)
They are 18 years of age or older;
(6)
They are competent to enter into a contract;
(7)
They are not related by blood closer than would bar marriage in the state;
(8)
They are each other's sole domestic partner;
(9)
They agree to file a termination of domestic partnership within 30 days if any of the facts set out in this definition change; and
(10)
Any prior domestic partnership in which any domestic partner participated with a third party was terminated not less than six months prior to the date of the declaration required hereunder, and, if such earlier domestic partnership had been acknowledged under provisions of this chapter, that notice of termination of such earlier domestic partnership was filed in the Municipal Court not less than six months prior to the date of said affidavit. If the prior domestic partnership was terminated by the death of a domestic partner, there shall be no waiting period.
Live together means that two people claiming domestic partnership status share the same primary, regular and permanent residence. It is not necessary that the legal right to possess the residence be in both names. Domestic partners do not cease to live together if one leaves the shared residence for a period not to exceed one year, but intends to return. Whether the relationship between these two people is or is not sexual is in no way relevant for the purposes of determining eligibility under this chapter.
Necessities of life means the cost of basic food, shelter, clothing and medical care. The individuals need not contribute equally or jointly to the cost of these expenses as long as they agree that both are responsible and obligated for the cost.

Sec. 1-23-2. - Legal effect of declaration of domestic partnership.
(a)
Rights and duties created. Neither this chapter nor the filing of a declaration of domestic partnership shall create any legal rights or duties from one of the parties to the other, except those which specifically refer to domestic partnership. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed explicitly or implicitly to create a marital relationship. This chapter does not attempt to alter or affect the laws in the state that regulate any private or civil relationships. Nothing herein requires that entities or individuals provide to unmarried persons one or more benefits, rights, or privileges in the same manner that such entity or person contractually provides benefits, rights or privileges to married persons.
(b)
Duration of rights and duties. Once a domestic partnership ends, the partners will incur no further obligations to each other under this chapter.

Sec. 1-23-3. - Establishing existence of domestic partnership.
(a)
Generally. Domestic partners who are residents of Athens-Clarke County or who are employees of Athens-Clarke County may establish the existence of their domestic partnership by presenting an original declaration of domestic partnership to the Athens-Clarke County Municipal Court along with reasonable proof of residence such as, but not limited to, driver's license, utility bill, or state identification card. The Municipal Court will file the declaration in its records and provide the partners with a certificate showing that the declaration was filed with the Municipal Court. The standard declaration form will be available in the Municipal Court during normal business hours.

Limitations. The Municipal Court shall only accept for filing declarations of domestic partnership submitted by domestic partners who have residence in Athens-Clarke County or who are employees of Athens-Clarke County.

Amendments to the declaration. A partner may amend a declaration of domestic partnership filed with the Municipal Court at any time to show a change in such partner's primary residence address.
(d)
New declarations of domestic partnership. No person who has created a domestic partnership may create another until six months after a notice of termination has been signed and filed with the Municipal Court; provided, however, that if the domestic partnership ended because of the death of the other party, a new declaration may be filed any time after the notice of termination has been filed.
(e)
Evidence of domestic partnership. Any person who requires a person to provide evidence of the existence of a domestic partnership must accept the declaration of domestic partnership, but may choose not to require the declaration, as complete proof of the existence of a domestic partnership. The declaration of domestic partnership may be considered reasonable proof for qualifying for any present or future domestic partner benefits that private corporations or public institutions offer.

The partners no longer meet one or more of the qualifications or conditions for domestic partnership.

(2)
To third parties. A domestic partner who has given a copy of a declaration of domestic partnership to any third party in order to qualify for any benefit or right must, whenever the domestic partnership ends, give that third party a copy of the notice of termination. If a partner has died, the surviving partner must give notice of termination to those third parties such partner knows were given copies of the declaration by the deceased partner in order to qualify for a benefit or right. The notice of termination must be sent to the parties identified in this paragraph within 60 days of the termination of the domestic partnership.
