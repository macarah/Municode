modified

Footnotes:
--- (3) ---
Editor's note— Ord. of 5-5-2009, § 4, deleted the former Ch. 9-13, §§ 9-13-1—9-13-7, and enacted a new Ch. 9-13 as set out herein. The former Ch. 9-13 pertained to Airport Overlay (A) District and derived from Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1.

Sec. 9-13-1. - Purpose.
The purpose of the Airport Overlay (A) Zone is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by assuring that development within areas impacted by airport operations is appropriately planned to mitigate the impact of such operations. Further, this overlay zone is intended to prevent the establishment of air space obstructions in air approaches through height restrictions and other land use controls, as deemed essential to protect the public health, safety, and welfare consistent with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 77. This overlay zone is intended to be applied to properties which lie within close proximity to the Athens-Ben Epps Airport where aircraft are likely to be flying at relatively low elevations. This overlay zone is further intended to identify noise corridors which should be planned to regulate future airport encroachment by inappropriate land uses and to minimize the effects of airport noise.
Within the Airport Overlay Zone there are established three subzones in which specific airport standards and requirements shall apply to each property within the subzones in addition to the standards and requirements of the underlying zoning district. In case of conflicting standards and requirements, the more stringent standards and requirements shall apply. Application of a subzone does not alter the requirements of the underlying zone except as specifically provided herein. The Airport Overlay Zone and its subzones are shown on the Official Athens-Clarke County Zoning Map adopted under Section 9-3.
(Ord. of 5-5-2009, § 4)
Sec. 9-13-2. - Airport Overlay (A) Zone.
The "A" (Airport) zone is an overlay zone that overrides any conflicting provisions of the underlying zoning district.
A.
Definitions. Definitions contained in Chapter 9-2, and not in conflict with the definitions below, shall apply. Definitions of any additional aviation terms not in conflict herewith will be defined by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and applicable Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) or advisory circulars. For the purposes of the Airport Overlay Zone, the following definitions apply:
Airport. Means the airport facility known as the Athens-Ben Epps Airport.
Approach, Transitional, and Runway Protection Zones. These zones are set forth in Paragraph B below.
Established Airport Elevation. 807.7 feet above mean sea level.
Hazard to Air Navigation. An obstruction determined to have an adverse effect on the safe and efficient utilization of the navigable airspace.
Height. For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth in this Chapter and shown on the zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified.
Obstruction. Any structure, tree, or other object, including a mobile object, which exceeds a limiting height set forth in Section 9-13-3.

Surfaces. The following imaginary surfaces exist in the Airport Overlay zone.
Approach Surface. A surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline, extending outward and upward from the end of the primary surface and at the same slope as the approach zone height limitation slope set forth in Paragraph B below. In plan the perimeter of the approach surface coincides with the perimeter of the approach zone.
Conical Surface. A surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to one for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
Horizontal Surface. A horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which in plan coincides with the perimeter of the horizontal zone.
Primary Surface. A surface longitudinally centered on an existing runway. When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway. When the runway has no specially prepared hard surface or planned hard surface, the primary surface ends at each end of that runway. The width of the primary surface is set forth in Paragraph B below. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline.
Transitional Surfaces. These surfaces extend outward at 90 degree angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces.
Tree. Any object of vegetative growth.
B.
Airport Overlay Zone (A) with subzones established. The Airport Overlay Zone is hereby divided into the following subzones which represent different levels of impact based on proximity to the airport. These established subzones include the land lying beneath the associated airspace surface which includes the approach surfaces and transitional surfaces. The geographic boundaries of the subzones are shown on the Athens-Clarke County Official Zoning Map. Collectively these subzones compose the "Airport Overlay (A) Zone." An area located in more than one of the following subzones is considered to be only in the subzone with the more restrictive height limitation. The subzones are hereby established and defined as follows:
(1)

(Ord. of 5-5-2009, § 4)
Sec. 9-13-6. - Height Restrictions in the Horizontal and Conical Zones established in the Airport Master Plan.
In addition to the height restrictions in the Airport Overlay Zone, the following height restrictions apply to the Conical Zone and Horizontal Zone as more particularly described in Drawing Number 4, Drawing Name "Airport Airspace Plan," dated August 2003, and found in the Master Plan Update Final Report - Athens-Ben Epps Airport, (hereinafter Airport Master Plan), dated September 2003, prepared for Athens-Clarke County Athens-Ben Epps Airport by the LPA Group Aviation Consultants, which Drawing is on file and available for public inspection in the Athens-Clarke County Planning Department and is incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein. The Airport Master Plan is on file and available for public inspection in the Office of the Director of Athens-Ben Epps Airport.
A.
Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone in the Airport Master Plan is established by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. Except as provided below for temporary structures, no structure shall penetrate the Horizontal Zone established at 150 feet above the airport elevation or at a height of 957.7 feet above mean sea level for the Athens-Ben Epps Airport.
Temporary Structures within the Horizontal Zone of 150 feet above the lowest runway elevation must file notice with the FAA on form 7460-1, with notification of the application to the Airport Authority, and receive approval from the Airport Director, or his/her designated representative, for such construction. In addition should the Airport Director deny approval for construction, an appeal may be made to the Hearings Board, as a Type IV procedure. The decision of the Hearings Board shall be the final decision of Athens-Clarke County, subject to appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction.
B.
Conical Zone. The conical zone in the Airport Master Plan is established as the area that commences the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there from a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The conical zone slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation. No structure with a height that penetrates the Conical zone shall be permitted.
(Ord. of 5-5-2009, § 4)
Sec. 9-13-7. - Nonconforming Uses and Structures.
A.
Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed in this Chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this Chapter or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a legal nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this Chapter, and is diligently pursued and completed within the time allowed by the building code.
B.
Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this Section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Planning Director and the Airport Director to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstructions. See FAA Advisory Circular 70-7460-1K for further guidance. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the airport.
(Ord. of 5-5-2009, § 4)
Sec. 9-13-8. - Variances in the Airport Overlay.
modified
Except as otherwise prohibited in this chapter, the Hearings Board may authorize a variance from the terms of these regulations in this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of provisions of this title will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship. No variance shall be granted for any structure with a height that penetrates any of the airport overlay subzones established in Section 9-13-2 or the conical or horizontal zones established in 9-13-6.
In addition to following Type IV procedure, the application for a variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposed variance on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe and efficient use of navigable airspace. Notwithstanding such FAA determination, such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon deliberation of the evidence and a finding by the Hearings Board that:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to this particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, character, or topography that do not apply generally to other land in the vicinity; and
(2)
The strict application of the provisions of this Title to this particular piece of property would create an undue and unnecessary hardship so that the grant of the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a property right and not merely to serve as a convenience to the applicant; and
(3)
The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; and
(4)
The benefits of granting the variance will be greater than any negative impacts on the development of the adjacent uses and will further the purpose and intent of this Title and the Comprehensive Plan of Athens-Clarke County; and
(5)
The variance, if granted, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief from the identified hardship and will represent the least deviation possible from the zoning regulation and from the comprehensive plan; and
(6)
The relief requested will not create a hazard to air navigation or impede the operation of the airport.
Additionally, no application for a variance to the requirements of this Chapter may be considered by the Hearings Board unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Airport Authority for their review and their consideration based on the above standards. The written recommendation of the Airport Authority shall be sent to the Hearings Board. The written recommendation of the Airport Authority is not binding on the Hearings Board.

Sec. 9-13-9. - Planned Development Waivers of Airport Overlay Standards.
new
A Planned Development (PD) application may include a waiver request of a requirement of this Chapter that is not otherwise prohibited as a variance in this chapter. Such a request shall follow the Type I procedures set forth in Section 9-4-3(C), the procedures and requirements set forth in Chapter 9-14, and the review criteria in Section 9-13-4(D). The Airport Authority shall be given an opportunity to review the planning staff's report and to recommend in writing either approval or denial of the requested waiver to the Planning Commission. The Airport Authority recommendation and the Planning Commission recommendation shall be forwarded together to the Mayor and Commission for the final decision. The Airport Authority recommendation shall be advisory only and shall not be binding on the Planning Commission or on the Mayor and Commission.
