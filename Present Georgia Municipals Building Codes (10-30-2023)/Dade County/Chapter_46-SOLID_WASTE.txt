Said notice shall state the time, place, and purpose of the hearing, and shall identify the property, its location, and the intended industrial use of the property. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing at which the special use permit is proposed, the same information shall be posted on a sign conspicuously located on the subject property. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing, each owner of real property located within one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet to the proposed building or use as measured by a straight-line distance shown by the records maintained by the county tax assessor shall be notified of such public hearing by mail addressed to each property owner.
(c)
Conduct of public hearing. At said hearing, special use permit board staff shall introduce the application and present data and analysis of the application. The applicant requesting the special use permit shall then be allowed to speak and present data, evidence and witnesses regarding the subject of the application. The board chair shall then open the floor to other interested persons. Proponents and opponents of the proposed special use permit shall be allowed at least five (5) minutes per person and at least fifteen (15) minutes per side to speak and present data and evidence regarding the subject of the application. The board chair may allow proponents or opponents additional time if the circumstances of the particular application require it, provided that equal additional time will be afforded to both sides. In addition to oral presentations, proponents and opponents may submit written data and evidence to the board.
(d)
Standards and criteria. In considering whether to grant a special use permit, the board shall consider the following:
(1)
The existing land use of the subject property, nearby properties, and properties reasonably to be impacted the industrial use;
(2)
The suitability of the subject property for its current use;
(3)
Whether the proposed industrial use will be suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby properties;
(4)
Whether the proposed industrial use will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby properties;
(5)
Whether the proposed industrial use is one which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools;
(6)
Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the proposed industrial use;
(7)
Whether the proposed industrial use will be detrimental to the natural environment, including water quality and resources, air quality and wildlife;
(8)
Whether any negative effects from the proposed industrial use can be mitigated by reasonable and appropriate conditions of approval;
(9)
Whether the proposed industrial use will reasonably be expected to have a detrimental impact to property values of adjacent or nearby properties; and
(10)
What benefits and burdens will the proposed use have on the Dade County and regional economy?
(e)
Decision. Within sixty (60) days of the public hearing, the special use permit board may deny the application, grant the application, or grant the application with conditions reasonably designed to mitigate any negative effects from the proposed industrial use. If the board fails to take such action within the time provided, the application shall be referred to the board of commissioners to take any and all actions consistent with this article. A denial of an application shall state the reasons for the denial, and shall advise the applicant of potential remedial actions, if any, which may be taken to bring the application into compliance with this article. The final decision, including any conditions, shall be reduced to writing, delivered to the applicant, and kept on file in the records of the county clerk. The special use permit board may record such final decision in the deed records maintained by the clerk of the superior court to provide future purchasers of the property notice of any conditions of an approved special use.
Any person aggrieved by act or omission of the special use permit board with respect to proceedings under this article may appeal to the board of commissioners of the county by filing such appeal with the county clerk within fifteen (15) days of the decision or action. Such appeal shall be based upon the record previously considered by, and submitted to the special use permit board. The board of commissioners may affirm the decision of the special use permit board, reverse the decision, or remand the decision back to the special use permit board for further investigation or proceedings. The decision of the board of commissioners may be further appealed to the county superior court in the manner provided by general law provided such appeal is filed with the county superior court clerk within thirty (30) days of the final decision of the county board of commissioners. If the applicant/licensee does not file an appeal to the board of commissioners or to the county superior court within the periods provided, then the decision of the of the special use permit board or board of commissioners of the county shall be final. Any party to the appeal may refer this matter to the Alternative Dispute Resolution office of the Lookout Mountain Judicial Circuit. An application that has been denied may not be re-filed until one (1) year following the date of a final action rejecting the application. This one-year limitation is not intended to apply to applications or circumstances that are materially different from the previous application.
