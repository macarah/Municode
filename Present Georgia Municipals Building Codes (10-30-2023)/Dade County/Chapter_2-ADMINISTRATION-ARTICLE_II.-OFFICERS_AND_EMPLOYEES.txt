Sec. 2-67. - Testing process.
(a)
Analytical urine drug testing and breath testing for alcohol may be conducted when circumstances warrant or as required by federal regulations. All safety-sensitive and nonsafety-sensitive employees shall be subject to drug and alcohol testing prior to employment, for reasonable suspicion and following an accident as set forth in sections 2-70—2-72. Refusal to submit to the test or failure to pass the test will be cause for immediate termination of employment. The employee will be referred to a substance abuse professional but will be discharged from employment. Those employees who perform safety-sensitive functions shall also be subject to testing on a random, unannounced basis. Employees who are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Transit System and Federal Highway Administration shall be required to undergo testing required by such departments.
(b)
Drug and alcohol testing shall be conducted in a manner that assures a high degree of accuracy and reliability and using techniques, equipment and laboratory facilities which have been approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). All testing will be conducted consistent with the procedures set forth in 49 CFR 40, as amended.
(c)
Drugs that will be tested for include marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and phencyclidine. An initial drug screen will be conducted on each urine specimen. For those specimens that are not negative, a confirmatory gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS) test will be performed. The test will be considered positive if the amounts present are above the minimum thresholds established in 49 CFR 40, as amended. In instances where there is a reason to believe an employee is abusing a substance other than the drugs listed in this subsection, the county reserves the right to test for additional drugs under the county's own authority using standard laboratory testing protocols.
(d)
Tests for breath alcohol concentration will be conducted utilizing a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)-approved testing device operated by a trained technician. If the initial test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a confirmatory test will be performed using a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration-approved evidential breath testing (EBT) device operated by a trained breath alcohol technician (BAT). A safety-sensitive or nonsafety-sensitive employee who has a confirmed alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 will be removed from his position of employment for eight (8) hours unless a retest results in a concentration measure of less than 0.02. The inability of an employee to perform safety-sensitive duties due to an alcohol test result of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 will be removed from his position for twenty-four (24) hours unless a retest results in a concentration measure of less than 0.02. The inability of an employee to perform assigned duties due to an alcohol test result of greater than 0.02 but less than 0.04 will be considered an unexcused absence subject to county disciplinary procedures. An alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater will be considered a positive alcohol test and the employee will be removed from his position of employment, informed of educational rehabilitation programs available and referred to a substance abuse professional for assessment. A positive drug and/or alcohol test will also result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. The county affirms the need to protect individual dignity, privacy and confidentiality throughout the testing process.
(Ord. No. O-1-96, § 5.8, 6-6-1996)
Sec. 2-68. - When testing performed.
Alcohol tests will only be performed immediately before, during or immediately after the performance of safety-sensitive job functions. Drug tests will be performed any time a safety-sensitive employee is on duty.
(Ord. No. O-1-96, § 6.0, 6-6-1996)
Sec. 2-69. - Employee requested testing.
Any safety-sensitive or nonsafety-sensitive employee who questions the results of a required drug test under sections 2-70—2-75 may request that the split sample be tested. This test must be conducted by a different U.S. Department of Health and Human Services-certified laboratory. The test must be conducted on the split sample that was provided by the employee at the same time as the original sample. All costs for testing are paid by the employee unless the result of the split sample invalidates the result of the original test. The method of collecting, storing and testing the split sample will be consistent with the procedures set forth in 49 CFR 40, as amended. The employee's request for a split sample test must be made to the medical review officer within seventy-two (72) hours of notice of the original sample verified test result. Requests made after seventy-two (72) hours will only be accepted if the request delay was due to documentable facts that were beyond the control of the employee.
(Ord. No. O-1-96, § 6.1, 6-6-1996)
Sec. 2-70. - Pre-employment testing.
All safety-sensitive and nonsafety-sensitive position applicants shall undergo urine drug testing immediately following the offer of employment or transfer into an assigned safety-sensitive position. Receipt by the county of a negative drug test result is required prior to employment or transfer. Failure of a pre-employment drug test will disqualify an applicant for employment for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days. Evidence of the absence of drug dependency from a substance abuse professional that meets county approval and a negative pre-employment drug test will be required prior to further consideration for employment. The cost for the assessment and any subsequent treatment will be the sole responsibility on the individual tested.
(Ord. No. O-1-96, § 6.2, 6-6-1996)
Sec. 2-71. - Reasonable suspicion testing.
All safety-sensitive and nonsafety-sensitive employees may be subject to a fitness for duty evaluation and urine and/or breath testing when there are reasons to believe that drug or alcohol use is adversely affecting such employee's job performance. A reasonable suspicion referral for testing will be made on the basis of documented objective facts and circumstances which are consistent with the shortterm effects of substance abuse or alcohol misuse. Examples of reasonable suspicion include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1)
Physical signs and symptoms consistent with prohibited substance use or alcohol misuse.
(2)
Evidence of the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of controlled or prohibited substances, drugs or alcohol.
(3)
Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may have been caused by prohibited substance abuse or alcohol misuse.
(4)
Fights (assault or battery) and flagrant disregard or violation of established safety, security or other operating procedures.
Reasonable suspicion referrals must be made by a supervisor who is trained to detect the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use and who reasonably concludes that an employee may be adversely affected or impaired in his work performance due to possible prohibited substance abuse and alcohol misuse.
(Ord. No. O-1-96, § 6.3, 6-6-1996)
Sec. 2-72. - Post-accident testing.
(a)
All safety-sensitive and nonsafety-sensitive employees will be required to undergo urine and breath testing if they are involved in an accident with a county vehicle (on or off duty) that results in a fatality. This includes all surviving safety-sensitive or nonsafety-sensitive employees that are operating such vehicle or a passenger in such vehicle and any other safety-sensitive or nonsafety-sensitive employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident. A post-accident test will also be conducted if an accident results in injuries requiring immediate transportation to a medical treatment facility; or one (1) or more vehicles incurs disabling damage; or the employee receives a citation under state or local law for a moving violation arising from the accident. If no citation is given, the county system's safety-sensitive and nonsafety-sensitive employee may still be tested if such employee cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident.
(b)
Following an accident, the safety-sensitive and nonsafety-sensitive employee will be tested as soon as possible, but not to exceed eight (8) hours for alcohol testing and thirty-two (32) hours for drug testing. Any safety-sensitive or nonsafety-sensitive employee involved in an accident must refrain from alcohol use for eight (8) hours following the accident or until he/she undergoes a post-accident alcohol test. Any safety-sensitive or nonsafety-sensitive employee who leaves the scene of an accident without justifiable explanation prior to submission to drug and alcohol testing will be considered to have refused the test and his employment will be terminated. Employees tested under this section will include not only the operations personnel, but any other covered employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident.
(Ord. No. O-1-96, § 6.4, 6-6-1996)
Sec. 2-73. - Random testing.
Employees in assigned positions will be subject to random, unannounced drug and alcohol tests. The selection of safety-sensitive and nonsafety-sensitive employees for random alcohol testing will be made using a scientifically valid method that ensures each covered employee will have an equal chance of being selected each time selections for random testing are made. The random tests will be unannounced and spread throughout the year.
(Ord. No. O-1-96, § 6.5, 6-6-1996)
Sec. 2-74. - Return-to-duty testing.
All safety-sensitive and nonsafety-sensitive employees who previously tested positive on a drug or alcohol test must test negative for alcohol (below 0.02) and drugs and be evaluated and released to duty by the substance abuse professional before returning to work.
(Ord. No. O-1-96, § 6.6, 6-6-1996)
Sec. 2-75. - Followup testing.
Safety-sensitive and nonsafety-sensitive employees will be required to undergo frequent, unannounced urine and breath testing following their return to duty. The followup testing will be performed for a period of one (1) to five (5) years with a minimum of six (6) tests to be performed the first year.
(Ord. No. O-1-96, § 6.7, 6-6-1996)
Sec. 2-76. - Employment assessment.
Any safety-sensitive or nonsafety-sensitive employee who tests positive for the presence of illegal drugs or alcohol above the minimum thresholds set forth in 49 CFR 40, as amended, will be referred for evaluation by a substance abuse professional. A "substance abuse professional" is a licensed or certified physician, psychologist, social worker, employee assistance professional or addiction counselor with knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-related disorders. The substance abuse professional will evaluate each employee to determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with prohibited drug use or alcohol misuse. Assessment by a substance abuse professional or participation in the county's employee assistance program does not shield an employee from disciplinary action or guarantee employment or reinstatement with the county. If a safety-sensitive or nonsafety-sensitive employee is allowed to return to duty, he/she must properly follow the rehabilitation program prescribed by the substance abuse professional, he/she must have negative return-to-duty drug and alcohol tests and be subject to unannounced followup testing for a period of one (1) to five (5) years. The cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services will be paid directly by the employee or his insurance provider.
(Ord. No. O-1-96, § 7.0, 6-6-1996)
Sec. 2-77. - Disciplinary actions.

Whenever any claim is made or proceeding is brought against an employee, either against him/her asserting personal liability for damages arising out of the performance of his duties or in any way connected with the performance of his duties, whether based on negligence, violation of contract rights or violation of civil, constitutional, common law or other statutory rights, whether federal, state or local, the county shall, upon the employee's written request, provide for the employee's defense unless otherwise limited by the terms of this division. The board of commissioners may decline defense of an employee if the employee fails to provide notice in writing of any claim or proceeding to the commission within thirty (30) days after the employee has received notice of a claim or within ten (10) days after the employee has been served with process in a proceeding initiated against the employee.
(Ord. No. O-3-97, § 1-B, 9-4-1997)
Sec. 2-103. - Grounds for refusal of defense.
(a)
The county shall refuse to provide for the defense of a claim or proceeding brought against any employee if it determines that:
(1)
The act or omission did not arise out of and in the course of his employment;
(2)
The employee acted or failed to act because of actual or intentional misconduct, fraud, corruption or malice;
(3)
Defense of the claim or proceeding by the county would create a conflict of interest between the county and the employee;
(4)
The proceeding is a criminal prosecution;
(5)
Provision of a defense against the claim or proceeding would not be in the best interest of the county;
(6)
The employee acts or fails to act as a result of, or at a time when, his own self-indulgence substantially impaired his judgment, as, for example, an officer or employee who causes damage or injury while under the influence of drugs or alcohol while on the job;
(7)
The employee acts or fails to act, except in emergencies or the existence of extenuating circumstances, directly contrary to the advice of the county attorney;
(8)
The employee acts or fails to act in such manner as to constitute a criminal act, as, for example, misappropriation of property or funds;
(9)
The employee acted or failed to act in a willful disregard of county policy or specific instructions of the employee's supervisor; or
(10)
The employee fails to cooperate in the defense of the claim or proceeding.
(b)
Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit the county from providing a defense against a claim or proceeding where there is a conflict of interest between one (1) employee, or group of employees, of the county and another employee, or group of employees, of the county.
(c)
The determination required by subsection (a) of this section shall be made by the chairman of the board of commissioners. An appeal may be made by such employee to the commission in the event of a denial by the chairman. Such appeal must be submitted in writing within ten (10) days of the denial.
(d)
Upon approval of the defense of a claim or proceeding against an employee, the chairman shall refer the matter to the county attorney for disposition; however, if two (2) or more employees are involved, and the interest of one (1) employee, or group of employees, conflicts with the interest of another employee, or group of employees, then, in such event, the commission shall specify which employee, or group of employees, shall be represented by the county attorney and shall authorize the other employee, or group of employees, to employ counsel at the expense of the county; provided, however, that the selection and compensation of such other counsel shall be subject to the prior approval of the commission.

(a)

All compromises of claims or proceedings governed by this division shall be submitted to the commission for prior approval.
(b)
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, payment of judgments and claims shall be limited to the following:
(1)
No sum shall be paid where the employee's liability is based on a discretionary act, and the county and the employee reserve the right to asset all governmental and sovereign immunity in defense of such claims. Payment of judgments and claims pursuant to this section shall be made only where liability is based upon a ministerial act of the employee. It is the intent of this section to provide for the payment of claims and judgments only where the defense of sovereign and governmental immunity may not be asserted initially as a defense to the claim or proceeding.
(2)
No sum shall be paid on behalf of an employee in any one (1) claim or proceeding in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) for damages and not to exceed the total cost of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) per occurrence, except that attorney's fees of plaintiff's attorneys shall be allowed in addition, if awarded.
(3)
No sum shall be paid under the provisions of this division for punitive or exemplary damages awarded against any employee.

Excluded further from the operation of this division is any claim or proceeding for which insurance coverage is applicable.
