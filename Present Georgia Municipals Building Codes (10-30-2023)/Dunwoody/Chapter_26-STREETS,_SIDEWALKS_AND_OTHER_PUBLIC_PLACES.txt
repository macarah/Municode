Sec. 26-133. - Funding.
(a)
Assessment. Each owner of property abutting the sidewalks shall be assessed a share of the cost to be funded by the district, which cost shall be added to the ad valorem property taxes for each owner as provided in this section. No assessment shall be made against abutting property, unless the same is consented to in writing by the owners of 51 percent of the property abutting such improvements. Abutting shall mean adjacent to, contiguous with, or adjoining.
(b)
Pro rata costs. Each property owner's share of the cost shall be determined as follows: the total cost of the project shall be calculated by the city, and the figure so derived shall be known as the total project cost. The city shall next determine the linear feet of sidewalk that was constructed. The total cost shall then be divided by the total linear feet of sidewalk to derive the cost per foot. Each property owner abutting the sidewalks shall then be assessed an amount that equals the linear feet of street frontage the property owner has, multiplied by the cost per foot.
(c)
Payment. The sidewalk tax assessment shall be paid by one of two options, as follows:
(1)
Option one. The assessment may be paid in cash by the property owner within 90 days of the mailing of the assessment by the city. If paid under this option, the assessment will not bear an administrative fee, and no lien shall be recorded against the property. Payment shall be made to the City of Dunwoody and delivered to the public works department. If payment is not made in full within 90 days of the city's initial billing of the assessment, then payment option two shall automatically take effect. Once option two is in effect, the payment via option two shall be the property owner's sole option until all assessment payments are satisfied.
(2)
Option two. The assessment shall be paid in five equal annual installments. Payment of each such assessment shall be due and payable within 60 days from the mailing by regular mail of a bill from the city's revenue director. In the event option two is selected, the cost of processing, administration, recording the lien, and satisfaction of such lien shall be added to the assessment.
(d)
Proration. The property owner shall advise any purchaser of its property within the sidewalk district of the assessment. The property owner may conduct a proration of the assessment with the purchaser. The city shall not be responsible for the proration of the assessments between sellers and purchasers, nor shall the city be under any duty to notify any purchaser of the existence or liability for the assessment.
(e)
Delinquent assessment payment. If the assessment is not paid when due, the assessment shall be collected in the same manner as delinquent ad valorem taxes and shall be subject to the same interest and penalties.
(f)
Assessment constituting lien against property. The assessment shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recorded by the city manager or designee in the lien records of the clerk of the county superior court.
(g)
Processing and administration fee established. The fee for processing and administration of this option shall be established by the city revenue director and approved by the city council.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 26-213. - Definitions.
The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
City manager means the city manager of the City of Dunwoody, Georgia. The city manager may delegate his authority or be assisted by other employees as required.
Event means any parade, public assemblage, or special event as defined within this article.
Organization or group of private persons means a group of three or more persons, or their representatives, acting as a unit.
Parade means a group or number of people or vehicles, or the combination thereof, consisting of ten or more vehicles, 20 or more persons, five or more vehicles and ten or more persons, or a combination of three or more vehicles and five or more persons, proceeding or moving in a body or in concert along the streets or sidewalks of the city. Specifically excepted from this definition are funeral processions.
Producer means any person responsible for planning, producing and conducting an event. An event permit shall be issued only to an individual person. Therefore, if a group, organization, association, or other entity is producing the event, a designated producer shall be named for purposes of the permit, and this individual shall be solely and fully responsible for compliance with all provisions, including all financial requirements of this article and other applicable laws.
Public assemblage means any march, demonstration, picket line, procession, motorcade, rally, or gathering for a common purpose, consisting of persons, animals, or vehicles or a combination thereof upon or in the streets, parks, or other public grounds within the city that interferes with or has a tendency to interfere with the normal flow or regulation of vehicular traffic or that endangers or has the reasonable possibility of endangering the public's health, safety, or welfare.
Special event means a gathering of people, generally lasting from a few hours to a few days, designed for entertainment, recreation, and/or education. Special events either affect the ordinary use of parks, public streets, rights-of-way, or sidewalks, disrupt the flow of traffic on public streets or sidewalks, or include alcohol service or sales where it is not normally permitted. Events on private property which will make no use of city streets other than for lawful parking are not required to obtain an event permit. Common special events in Dunwoody are 5K races and festivals. Filming by a film production company does not require an event permit but does require a filming permit which is handled by a separate process.
Vendor means any person or persons or entity who engages in the sale to the public of any food or food products, goods, services, or merchandise of whatever nature from any location, either mobile or stationary, on a temporary itinerant basis on any public street, sidewalk, or right-of-way as an authorized participant of a permitted event.
