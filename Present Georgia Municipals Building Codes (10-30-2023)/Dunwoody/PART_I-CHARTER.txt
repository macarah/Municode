A period of time will be needed for an orderly transition of various government functions from DeKalb County to the City of Dunwoody. Accordingly there shall be a two-year transition period as allowed by law beginning at 12:01 a.m. on December 1, 2008.
(c)
During such transition period, DeKalb County shall continue to provide within the territorial limits of the city all government services and functions which DeKalb County provided in 2008 and at the same actual direct cost and level of service, except to the extent otherwise provided in this section; provided, however, that upon at least 30 days' prior written notice to the governing authority of DeKalb County by the governing authority of City of Dunwoody, responsibility for any such service or function shall be transferred to the City of Dunwoody.

(e)
During the transition period, all ordinances of DeKalb County shall remain applicable within the territorial limits of the city unless otherwise amended, repealed, or replaced by the City of Dunwoody.

Sec. 6.04. - Directory nature of dates.
It is the intention of the General Assembly that this Act be construed as directory rather than mandatory with respect to any date prescribed in this Act. If it is necessary to delay any action called for in this Act for providential cause, delay in securing approval under the federal Voting Rights Act, or any other reason, it is the intention of the General Assembly that the action be delayed rather than abandoned. Any delay in performing any action under this Act, whether for cause or otherwise, shall not operate to frustrate the overall intent of this Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing it is specifically provided that if it is not possible to hold the referendum election provided for in Section 6.02 of this Act on the date specified in that section, then such referendum shall be held as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable but not later than 45 days after securing approval under the federal Voting Rights Act.

Sec. 6.05. - Charter commission.
