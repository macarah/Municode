Appendix E, Section E101.1.2. Because of the variable conditions encountered in hydraulic design, it is impractical to specify definite and detailed rules for sizing of the water piping system. Accordingly, other sizing or design methods conforming to good engineering practice standards are acceptable alternatives to those presented herein. Without limiting the foregoing, such acceptable design methods may include for multi-family buildings the Peak Water Demand Calculator from the IAPMO/ANSI 2020 Water Efficiency and Sanitation Standard for the Built Environment, which accounts for the demands of water-conserving plumbing fixtures, fixture fittings, and appliances. If future versions of the Peak Water Demand Calculator including other building types, such as commercial, such updated version shall be an acceptable design method.
