Use categories. This zoning ordinance classifies principal land uses into five major groupings, which are referred to as use categories:
a.
Residential;
b.
Quasi-Public and Institutional;
c.
Commercial;
d.
Industrial;
e.
Agricultural.
(2)
Use subcategories. Each use category is further divided into more specific "subcategories." Use subcategories classify principal land uses and activities based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions.
(3)
Specific uses. Some use subcategories are further broken down to identify specific use, business or activity types that are regulated differently than the parent subcategory as a whole.
(4)
Use tables. The use tables in sections 27-57 and 27-72 identify uses allowed in residential districts and in nonresidential and mixed-use districts, respectively.
a.
Use categories, use subcategories and specific use types. The use categories and subcategories described in this division are identified in the first column of the use tables. In some cases, specific use types are listed in addition to the use categories and subcategories.
b.
Permitted uses. Uses identified with a "P" in the use tables are permitted as of right in the subject zoning district, subject to compliance with all other applicable regulations of this zoning ordinance.
c.
Special uses.
1.
Uses identified with an "S" in the use tables may be allowed if reviewed and approved in accordance with the special land use permit procedures of article V, division 3. Special land uses are subject to compliance with any supplemental use regulations identified in the final column of the tables and with all other applicable regulations of this zoning ordinance.
2.
Uses identified with an "E" in the use tables may be allowed if reviewed and approved in accordance with the special exception procedures of article V, division 6.

3.
Uses identified with an "A" in the use tables may be allowed if reviewed and approved in accordance with the administrative permit procedures of article V, division 7. Administrative permit uses are subject to compliance with any supplemental use regulations identified in the final column of the tables and with all other applicable regulations of this zoning ordinance.

Prohibited uses. Uses identified with an "-" are expressly prohibited. Uses that are not listed in the use table and that cannot reasonably be interpreted to fall within the use categories described in this article III, division 1 are also prohibited.
e.
Supplemental use regulations. The final column of use table identifies supplemental regulations that apply to some uses. Unless otherwise expressly stated, compliance with such regulations is required regardless of whether the use is permitted as of right or requires any form of special use approval.
(5)
Determination of use categories and subcategories.
a.
The community development director is authorized to classify uses on the basis of the use category and subcategory descriptions of this section.
b.
When a use cannot be readily classified into a use category/subcategory or appears to fit into multiple categories/subcategories, the community development director is authorized to determine the most similar, and thus most appropriate, use category/subcategory based on the actual or projected characteristics of the principal use or activity in relationship to the use category and subcategory descriptions provided in this section. In making such determinations, the community development director is authorized to consider all of the following:
1.
The types of activities that will occur in conjunction with the use;
2.
The types of equipment and processes to be used;
3.
The existence, number and frequency of residents, customers or employees;
4.
Parking demands associated with the use; and
5.
Other factors deemed relevant to a use determination.
c.
If a use can reasonably be classified in multiple categories, subcategories or specific use types, the community development director must categorize the use in the category, subcategory or specific use type that provides the most exact, narrowest and appropriate match.
d.
If the community development director is unable to determine the appropriate use category for a proposed use, the community development director is authorized to deny the permit request.

Sec. 27-147. - Residential infill.
Applicability: The residential infill regulations of this subsection apply to the construction and reconstruction of detached houses and the subdivision of land zoned single family:
(1)
Front door threshold elevation.
a.
Replacement of a detached house. The proposed front door threshold elevation for any new detached house may not be more than two feet higher than the front door threshold elevation of the residential structure that existed on the lot prior to demolition (see Figure 9-1). If there was no previous residential structure on the subject lot, or if the lot has been part of an approved subdivision that resulted in the creation of any new lots, then the proposed front door threshold elevation for a new detached house on the lot may not be more than two feet higher than the average elevation of the existing natural grade at the front building line (see Figure 9-2). If the proposed construction would require alteration or eradication of the original threshold, then the original elevation must be measured and certified by a licensed surveyor or engineer.
Figure 9-1: Residential Infill, Maximum Threshold Elevation Based on Previously Existing Threshold
Figure 9-2: Residential Infill, Maximum Threshold Elevation Based on Average Grade Elevation at Front Building Line
b.
Threshold averaging. The community development director is authorized to approve a proposed front door threshold elevation for new detached houses that exceed the threshold elevation allowed by subsection (1)a. if the applicant for a building permit establishes that the elevation of the front door threshold of the proposed residential structure does not exceed the average elevation of the front door thresholds of the residential structures on both lots immediately abutting the subject lot (see Figure 9-3). If any adjacent lot is vacant, the front door threshold shall be calculated using the formula in [subsection] (1)a. above (for lots with no previous residential structure, Figure 9-2). The applicant must provide the community development director with the threshold elevations, as certified by a licensed surveyor or engineer.
Figure 9-3: Residential Infill, Maximum Threshold Elevation Based on Threshold Averaging
c.
Sewer elevation. If an existing dwelling or lot is not connected to county sewer and if the community development director determines that the proposed residence is unable to be connected to county sewer by gravity flow within the allowable front door threshold height provided for in [subsection] (1)a or (1)b above, then the community development director is authorized to approve a maximum three-foot increase in the front door threshold height over and above the threshold elevation allowed by subsection (1)a or (1)b to provide for gravity flow into the existing sewer tap. The community development director's determination must be based on sewer line elevation data and other evidence provided by the applicant and any other pertinent information available to the director.
d.
Topographical conditions. If exceptional topographical restrictions exist on the subject lot that were not created by the owner or applicant, the community development director is authorized to approve a maximum three-foot increase in the front door threshold height over and above the threshold elevation allowed by either subsection (1)a, (1)b, or (1)c above. The applicant must provide a site plan, including topography, certified by an engineer or landscape architect.
(2)
Contextual street setbacks. Detached houses constructed on block faces that are occupied by two or more existing detached houses must comply with the contextual street setback regulations of this subsection.
a.
The street facing façade of a detached house subject to these contextual street setback regulations must be located within the range of street setbacks observed by detached houses that exist on the nearest two lots on both sides of the subject lot.
b.
If one or more of the nearest two lots on both sides of the subject lot is vacant, the vacant lot will be deemed to have a street setback depth equal to the minimum street setback requirement of the subject zoning district.
Figure 9-3[4]: Residential Infill, Contextual Setbacks (1)
c.
Lots with frontage on a different street than the subject lot or that are separated from the subject lot by a street or alley may not be used in determining the street setback range (see Figure 9-4).
Figure 9-4: Residential Infill, Contextual Setbacks (2)
d.
If the subject lot is a corner lot, the street setback range must be determined on the basis of the nearest two lots with frontage on the same street as the subject lot.
e.
If the subject lot abuts a corner lot with frontage on the same street, the street setback range must be determined on the basis of the abutting corner lot and the nearest two lots with frontage on the same street as the subject lot.
f.
These contextual street setback regulations may not be used to reduce the setback of a street-facing garage door to less than 20 feet.
(3)
Contextual lot characteristics. Proposed subdivisions that are adjacent to block faces that are occupied by two or more existing detached houses must comply with the contextual lot characteristic regulations of this subsection in addition to those requirements in chapters 16 and 27.
a.
Minimum lot area shall be determined by calculating the average area of lots that exist on the nearest four lots on both sides of the subject lot.
b.
Minimum lot frontage shall be determined by calculating the average frontage of lots that exist on the nearest four lots on both sides of the subject lot.
c.
Minimum lot width shall be determined by calculating the average width of lots that exist on the nearest four lots on both sides of the subject lot, measured along the building setback line.
d.
Corner lots or lots with multiple street frontages
1.
Area. Minimum lot area shall be determined by calculating the average area of lots that exist on the nearest four lots on both sides of the subject lot for all street frontages.
2.
Frontage. Minimum lot frontage shall be determined by calculating the average frontage of the nearest four lots on the side(s) with frontage on the same street as the subject frontage. An additional 15 feet shall be provided on all frontages above the minimum distance obtained by the average calculation for minimum lot frontage.
3.
Width. Minimum lot width shall be determined by calculating the average width of the nearest four lots on the side(s) with frontage on the same street as the subject width.
e.
Lots with frontage on a different street than the subject lot or that are separated from the subject lot by a street or alley may not be used in determining contextual lot characteristics, except as required for corner lots.
f.
In no circumstance shall the provisions of this subsection reduce any provision required by the base zoning district.
(4)
If existing land is proposed to be subdivided, the reference parcels for the purposes of determining contextual requirements shall be those immediately adjacent to and outside the parcel or group of parcels comprising the subject subdivision. Additionally, upon a determination of the community development director, parcels with the following characteristics shall not be used in calculating contextual street setbacks or lot characteristics. Where practical—the next immediate adjacent parcel meeting the requirements for use as a reference parcel, if any, shall be used for subject calculations:
a.
Unbuildable lots;
b.
Substandard or nonconforming lots;
c.
Unsubdivided property, or meets and bounds lots, which are uncharacteristic of the area and/or significantly exceed one or more of the minimum lot regulations for the zoning district, and/or are large raw undeveloped property which are expected to be the subject of a future subdivision request.
(5)
Building plans. Building plans for a detached house must be submitted for review and approval prior to issuance of a building permit. Plans must contain all information necessary to determine compliance with the building code and this zoning ordinance.
(6)
Exceptions. Exceptions to the requirements of this section 27-147, residential infill, may be requested through the special exception process as outlined in section 27-416. In addition to the review criteria of section 27-421(b), the zoning board of appeals shall also determine that the proposed exception will not be detrimental to or adversely impact adjacent property.
(7)
Determination. The community development director is authorized to determine whether the provisions of the contextual regulations for lot size, width, frontage and setbacks apply to the subdivision of land and/or construction of a single-family home on a lot. Findings used in this determination shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
Whether the lot(s):
1.
Is significantly different in character and/or contrary to the prevailing orientation of lots outside of the subdivision, (within the immediate surrounding or adjacent area); or
2.
Creates multiple new lots or lot/block configurations which create a different context; or
3.
Creates new streets and alignments of lots; or
4.
Alters other characteristics of the property such that the lot(s) represent a different context, are altered visually or physically from the characteristics of the adjacent/previous neighborhood and such conditions render the application of the contextual regulations for lot size, width, frontage, and setback impractical, unreasonable, or unwarranted.
The owners of property adjacent to the subject lot(s) will be notified of and may appeal the decision of the community development director per article V of this chapter.

(3)
The mayor and city council finds:
a.
Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter and sexual assault and exploitation.
b.
Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area.
c.
Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this division, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this division are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
(4)
The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.
(c)

(2)
The telecommunication facilities owner shall reasonably cooperate with the city to carry out reconditioning work activities for any poles or decorative poles owned by the city in a manner that minimizes interference with the approved use of the facility. The city shall use reasonable effort to provide the telecommunication facility owner with written notice of reconditioning work at least 120 days before such work begins. Upon receiving such notice, it shall be the telecommunication facility owner's sole responsibility to provide adequate measures to cover, remove, or otherwise protect the facility from the consequences of the reconditioning work, including but not limited to paint and debris fallout.

An applicant in the public right-of-way shall employ due care during the installation and maintenance process and shall comply with all safety and public right-of-way protection requirements in the city codes and regulations and State Law.
(2)
An applicant or permittee pursuant to this section shall not place any small cell installations, support structures, poles or decorative poles where they will interfere with any existing infrastructure or equipment and shall locate its lines and equipment in such a manner as not to interfere unnecessarily with the usual vehicular or pedestrian traffic patterns or with the rights or reasonable convenience of owners of property that abuts any public right-of-way.
(3)
If the city determines that a telecommunication facility owner's activity in the public right-of-way pursuant to this section creates an imminent risk to public safety, the city shall provide written notice to the facility owner requiring the facility owner to address said risk. If the facility owner fails to address the issue within 24 hours of the written notice, the city shall be authorized to address said issue at the facility owner's expense.
(4)
Any damage to the public right-of-way caused by the activities of the telecommunication facility owner while occupying, installing, repairing or maintaining small cell installations, poles, or support structures shall be repaired promptly by the facility owner. If the facility owner fails to conduct such repairs within 90 days of receipt of a written notice from the city notifying the facility owner of the damage to the right-of-way, the city shall be authorized to correct and repair the damage at the facility owner's expense, plus a $500.00 penalty. Failure of the facility owner to pay the city's expenses under those circumstances, as well as the penalty, shall result in the facility owner being prohibited from applying for, or receiving, any further permits under this section until the full amount is paid to the city.
(k)
Alternate locations. For application for new poles in the public right-of-way in areas zoned for residential use, the city may propose an alternate location in the public right-of-way within 100 feet of the location set forth in the application, and the applicant shall use the city's proposed alternate location unless the location imposes technical limits or significant additional costs, a fact the applicant must certify to have determined in good faith, based on the assessment of a licensed engineer, and shall provide a written summary of the basis for such determination.
(l)
First come, first served requests. If multiple applications are received by the city to install two or more poles or decorative poles at the same location or to co-locate two or more small cell installations on the same pole, decorative pole or support structure, the applications shall be considered in the order they were received once deemed complete and, if a permit is granted for the first completed application, the subsequent completed applications for the same location shall be deemed to be automatically denied.

Further, the city council finds it appropriate to regulate backyard chicken raising in the manner presented in this section, so as to be permissive enough to easily allow citizens to keep chickens on their property, but restrictive enough to protect the interests of neighboring residents from unnecessary noise, odor, and the invitation of rodents, wild birds and predatory animals to the property. Additionally, these regulations are intended to ensure the humane treatment of animals.
(b)
Prior authorization.

The community development director is authorized to approve or disapprove an application if he/she determines that the application fails to meet the requirements of this section.
(3)
Prior to obtaining zoning approval, the city may inspect the applicant's lot for compliance with city codes and zoning approval shall grant the right to a city code enforcement officer to enter onto applicant's lot at any time to investigate any chicken-related complaints or concerns.

This section does not authorize persons to violate applicable restrictive covenants and/or homeowners' association rules and regulations. Persons applying for and receiving zoning approval under this section are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable restrictive covenants and homeowners' association rules and regulations.
