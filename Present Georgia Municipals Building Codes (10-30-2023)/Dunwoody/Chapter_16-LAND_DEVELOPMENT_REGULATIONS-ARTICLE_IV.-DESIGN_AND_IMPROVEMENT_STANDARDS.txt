Editor's note— Section 1 of Ord. No. 2015-01-04, adopted Jan. 26, 2015, amended and renumbered former div. 4, "Subdivision Design," §§ 16-221—16-228 as a new div. 2, §§ 16-236—16-243 to read as herein set out.

Sec. 16-236. - General.
(a)
Adequate public facilities. The applicant must submit sufficient information and data with the application on the proposed subdivision to demonstrate compliance with the following:
(1)
Comprehensive plan consistency. Proposed public improvements must conform to and be properly related to the city comprehensive plan and all applicable capital improvement plans.
(2)
Water. All habitable buildings and buildable lots must be connected to a public water system capable of providing water for health and emergency purposes, including adequate fire protection.
(3)
Wastewater. All habitable buildings and buildable lots must be served by an approved means of wastewater collection and treatment.
(4)
Stormwater management. Drainage improvements must accommodate potential runoff from the entire upstream drainage area and must be designed to prevent increases in downstream flooding as required under article II, division 5 of this chapter. Stormwater quality management facilities must be adequate as required by article II, division 5 of this chapter. The city may require the use of control methods such as retention or detention, and or the construction of offsite drainage improvements to mitigate the impacts of the proposed developments.
(5)
Streets. Proposed streets must provide a safe, convenient, and functional system for all lawful modes of transportation, must be properly related to the comprehensive plan, and must be appropriate for the particular traffic characteristics of each proposed development. The community development director is authorized to require submittal of traffic impact study at the time of application for any development that will generate additional motor vehicle trips to or from the subject site during a 24-hour period or during the peak traffic hour, based on trip generation rates obtained from the most recent editions of Trip Generation and Trip Generation Handbook, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). Only "new" vehicle trips will be counted; no pass-by or internal trip capture will be used in calculating "added vehicle trips." Traffic impact studies must be prepared by a professional transportation planner or traffic engineer.
(6)
Extension policies. All public improvements and required easements must be extended through the parcel on which new development is proposed. Streets, water lines, wastewater systems, drainage facilities, electric lines, and telecommunications lines must be constructed through new development to promote the logical extension of public infrastructure.
(7)
Common areas. Where present, common areas, such as stormwater detention and open spaces, shall be dedicated to a required home owners association for maintenance and ownership responsibilities. Common areas are not subject to the requirements for lots.
(b)
Natural resources.
(1)
To better implement the policies and purposes of this chapter, to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city and to minimize the negative environmental effects of development, subdivisions must be designed and developed to avoid areas of environmental sensitivity. The following land areas must be preserved in their natural state and not subjected to any development or land-disturbance activity, and may not be part of the buildable area:
a.
Wetlands; and
b.
Special flood hazard areas.
(2)
Subdivisions must be also laid out to:
a.
Avoid adversely affecting watercourses, ground water, and aquifer recharge;
b.
Minimize cut and fill;
c.
Minimize impervious cover and the environmental impacts of roads and access points;
d.
Minimize flooding; and
e.
Minimize adverse effects of noise, odor, traffic, drainage, and utilities on neighboring properties.
(3)
The community development director may not recommend approval for a sketch plat or parts thereof if the community development director determines that:
a.
The areas listed [in] subsection (b)(1) have not been set aside and protected from development;
b.
The proposed subdivision does not comply with the requirements of subsection (b)(2); or
c.
If the proposed subdivision is not in the best interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare of the city.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-14, 1(Exh. A § 16-14.10), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-04, § 1, 1-26-2015)
Sec. 16-237. - Streets.
(a)
Arrangement.
(1)
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all subdivision streets must conform to the provisions of this chapter and to the comprehensive transportation plan. New streets must be designed and located with consideration of their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by the streets.
(2)
Where not shown in the comprehensive transportation plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision must either:
a.
Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets in surrounding areas; or
b.
Conform to a plan for a neighborhood approved or adopted by the city council to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable.
(3)
Local residential streets must be designed to discourage speeding and provide a safe environment for nonmotorized transportation.
(4)
Within historic districts, the platting of lots and streets must be compatible with the historic patterns that exist within the historic district except for numbered state or federal routes.
(b)
Comprehensive transportation plan review. The community development director and the public works director must review changes in the patterns of traffic, land development, and subdivisions, and prepare a report to the city council with recommendations concerning appropriate revisions to the comprehensive transportation plan. Such review must:
(1)
Ensure safe and efficient access between neighborhoods and local services;
(2)
Ensure the continuity and adequacy of local streets, collector streets and arterial streets to form a coherent and continuous system of routes;
(3)
Identify applications of appropriate traffic calming and traffic management strategies to discourage unnecessary traffic and travel speeds in neighborhoods; and
(4)
Ensure a coherent and continuous system for nonmotorized travel.
(c)
Subdivisions bordering major streets or railroad rights-of-way. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an arterial or collector street, a railroad right-of-way or limited-access highway right-of-way, the community development director may impose reasonable limits or conditions on the number, type, location and design of driveway access points, including but not limited to the following:
(1)
Rear service alleys to facilitate traffic flow, safety and public services;
(2)
Provision of one or a pair of smaller marginal access streets approximately parallel to and on each side of this right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land as park or open space and to provide for multipurpose trails. These distances must also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations; or
(3)
In the case of limited-access highways only, reverse frontage lots may be created with landscape buffers and a non-access reserve strip along the rear property line.
(d)
Reserve strips. Reserve strips that separate developed or undeveloped land from necessary access to streets are prohibited except when such access is controlled by the city.
(e)
Intersections.
(1)
Spacing. Street intersections with nearest edge of pavement offsets of less than 125 feet are prohibited.
(2)
General design. Street intersections in subdivisions must be as nearly at right angles as practicable. No interior angle may be less than 75 degrees. Intersections of more than two streets must be designed in accordance with city standards and specifications.
(3)
Radius. Right-of-way lines at intersections must be rounded by a tangential arc that is concentric with the paved radii lines. At each street intersection in a subdivision the property line at each block corner must either be mitered or rounded. A mitered property line must be located on the interior chord of a convex curve or located 15 feet inside the tangent of a concave curve. A rounded property line must be established with a curve of radius R varying with the interior angle as specified in the following table, unless sufficient data is presented to show that strict adherence to this requirement is impractical due to topographical or engineering considerations.

  (4)
Grade at intersections must have tangent of no greater than two percent.
(f)
Street frontage. Each building must be located on a lot or parcel that abuts a public street or private street.
(g)
Private streets.
(1)
Private streets are allowed only if the development seeking to have a private streets is ten acres or larger in area. The zoning board of appeals is authorized to waive this minimum acreage requirement if all real property owners that abut the proposed private street agree to such waiver.
(2)
Where this chapter measures minimum building setback lines and frontages, or imposes development standards in connection with, or with reference to public streets, such measurements or standards set forth in the district regulations and supplemental regulations of the city zoning ordinance, in this chapter or elsewhere in this Code apply similarly for property abutting a private street where such private street has been approved by the zoning board of appeals. Nothing in this section is intended to authorize any kind of development on a private street that would not be authorized where there was public right-of-way.
(3)
Private streets within any zoning district may not be used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements of this Code. Private streets within any district must be assigned names and locations. The names of these streets must be shown on plans required for the issuance of building and development permits as provided in this chapter, chapter 8, and the city zoning ordinance. The city geographic information services department must approve all private street names and addresses to avoid conflicting names and addresses.
(4)
Where sanitary or storm sewer lines are constructed underneath a private street, the developer is required to grant an easement to the applicable utility authority for their installation, maintenance and repair. In the case of private streets, the city is authorized to assign responsibility for maintenance of storm sewers to a property owners association.
(5)
Private streets are not eligible for participation in the city's residential sidewalk district program as provided for in this Code.
(6)
Developers and property owners' associations must ensure access to all private streets by emergency and law enforcement vehicles and must ensure that private streets are constructed to allow access by all emergency vehicles and law enforcement vehicles.
(7)
The use of private streets may not result in an increase in permitted density above that which would otherwise be permitted by the applicable district regulations. Density calculations must be made based on a public street system and the preliminary plat that provides for a private street must be density neutral.
(8)
Private streets must comply with requirements for public streets found in this chapter and all other applicable sections of this Code. Private streets must be surfaced with the same type of materials that are used by the city's department of public works for the surfacing and resurfacing of public streets or with materials that are as protective as those used by the city to surface and resurface streets so long as such alternative materials are approved by the director of public works.
(9)
The zoning board of appeals may authorize a private street where the department of community development has certified that the applicant has submitted all required documentation as set forth herein and where the zoning board of appeals finds that:
a.
The location of the proposed private street will not adversely impact use of any existing surrounding public street;
b.
The location of the proposed private street will not adversely impact adjacent existing communities or neighborhoods;
c.
The applicant has shown that there is the requisite legal mechanism for the maintenance of the proposed private street; and
d.
The applicant has provided written evidence that the proposed private street system is acceptable to the city departments or divisions responsible for law enforcement, sanitation, transportation and fire and rescue.
(10)
Private street rights-of-way must be owned by the mandatory homeowners' association as required by subsection (h)(11). Street rights-of-way must comply with all the requirements set forth in this Code, including, but not limited to, the requirements set forth in this chapter and in the city zoning ordinance. An access easement and a utility easement must entirely overlay the rights-of-way and must be dedicated to the city for public use. All applicable setbacks, lot widths and lot areas must be measured from the homeowner's association right-of-way.
(11)
Each developer that chooses to include private streets within a condominium, as that term is defined by state law, or any other residential, commercial, institutional, industrial or office development, must organize and establish a property owners' association prior to recording of the final plat. Membership in the property owners' association must be mandatory for each original and successive purchaser of a lot, building or unit within the development. The property owners' association must be organized so that it has clear legal authority to maintain and exercise control over the private streets and required improvements associated with private streets, including, but not limited to, sidewalks, bikeways, curbs and gutters, traffic signs and markings, associated landscaping and lighting, entry signs, monuments, perimeter walls and fences, entry gates and gatehouses. The declaration of covenants creating the property owners' association must be recorded with the clerk of the county superior court and the recorded declaration of covenants and articles of incorporation creating the property owners' association must provide that all private streets and associated improvements are owned by the property owners' association or are held in common by the property owners within the development. The streets must be properly maintained and insured with no liability or maintenance responsibilities accruing to the city. The recorded declaration of covenants and articles of association must specifically require the property owners' association repair and maintain each private street in the same manner as similar public streets are maintained by the city and such maintenance and repair must be performed in compliance with all city standards and all applicable provisions of law.
(12)
Prior to any final plat approval, the developer must submit articles of incorporation, declarations of covenants and bylaws for the property owners' association to the department of community development. Those documents must thereafter be reviewed and approved by the community development director.
(13)
The declaration of covenants and articles of association must provide for a street maintenance fund the proceeds of which may be used solely for the purpose of regular maintenance of the streets, whether for resurfacing or a similar purpose. For the purposes of providing further assurance that city funds may not be used for maintenance of private streets, the developer must submit proof of deposit of 50 percent of the current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the community development director or his designee, in an interest bearing account on behalf of the property owners' association.
(14)
At the end of the 12-month maintenance period provided for in this subsection, a developer must provide a maintenance bond or letter of credit, renewable annually to cover the cost of maintenance and repair for any private streets within a subdivision. The bond must be for an amount equal to 50 percent of the current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the community development director or his designee. The developer may avoid securing a maintenance bond if they submit proof to the department of community development that 100 percent of the then-current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the community development director, has been deposited in an interest-bearing account on behalf of the property owners' association. If the developer chooses this alternative, the declarations of covenants and articles of association must specifically require the property owners' association to continuously maintain 100 percent of the then-current estimate of resurfacing costs of the private streets in this maintenance fund.
(15)
The property owners' association must be empowered to levy assessments against owners within the development for the payment of expenditures made by the association for maintenance of the private streets and other items set forth in this subsection. At least 15 percent of all fees or assessments paid must be set aside in the maintenance fund. Any unpaid assessments will constitute a lien in favor of the property owners' association on the lot, building or unit of the owner.
(16)
Within nine months following approval of the final plat, the city's community development director or his designee must inspect the private streets to ensure compliance with all city standards and all applicable provisions of this Code including, but not limited to, the requirements set forth in law for public streets, curbs, sidewalks, signage and street lighting. The developer must be notified of any deficiencies in writing and such deficiencies must be corrected within 60 days of the written notice of deficiencies unless the city agrees to extension of that period in writing.
(17)
Failure to correct the complete list of deficiencies constitutes a violation of this section and will subject the developer to prosecution for a code violation in the city municipal court. Any person found to have violated this section is subject to a fine of not less than $500.00 for each violation. Each day that the violation exists is a separate and distinct offense.
(18)
The community development director or his designee must deny the issuance of certificates of occupancy until all deficiencies have been corrected.
(h)
Street abandonment.
(1)
Any abandonment of a public street by the city pursuant to this section must comply with the applicable requirements set forth in state law and this Code, including, but not limited to, the requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. §§ 32-7-2(b) and 32-7-4 and as may hereinafter be amended.
(2)
A property owner may petition the city council to abandon an existing public street that abuts the owner's property. The petition must include documents that comply with all of the requirements set forth in this section.
(3)
The petition must contain evidence that each abutting landowner to the public street seeks to have the street abandoned.
(4)
The petition must contain evidence that once abandoned pursuant to the requirements of state law, all property owners that abut the street agree that ownership of the street must be placed in a property owners' association. The petition must include evidence that 100 percent of all property owners in the property owners' association have agreed that the street at issue may become private and have agreed to maintain and exercise control over the private street as required by this section.
(5)
The petition must contain evidence that the property owners' association has the financial ability to maintain the street and associated improvements in perpetuity.
(6)
The petition must include evidence that the declaration of covenants and articles of association or other legal instruments creating the property owners' association provide or have been amended to provide that membership in the property owners' association is mandatory for each original and successive purchaser of a lot, building or unit on the street.
(7)
The petition must include evidence that the property owners' association must be organized so that it has absolute legal authority to maintain and exercise control over the private streets and required improvements associated with private streets, including, but not limited to, sidewalks, bikeways, curbs and gutters, traffic signs and markings, associated landscaping and lighting, entry signs, monuments, perimeter walls and fences, entry gates and gatehouses.
(8)
The petition must include evidence that the declaration of covenants creating the property owners' association must be recorded with the clerk of the county superior court and the recorded declaration of covenants and articles of incorporation creating the property owners' association must provide that all private streets and associated improvements are owned by the property owners' association or are held in common by the property owners within the development. The streets must be properly maintained and insured with no liability or maintenance responsibilities accruing to the city.
(9)
The petition must include evidence that the declaration of covenants and articles of association must provide for a maintenance fund, the proceeds of which may be used solely for the purpose of regular maintenance of the streets, whether for resurfacing or similar purpose. For the purposes of providing further assurances that city funds will not be required or used for maintenance of private streets, the property owners' association must submit proof of a maintenance fund equal to 50 percent of the current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the community development director or his designee, in an interest bearing account on behalf of the property owners' association.
(10)
The petition must include evidence that the property owners have a maintenance bond renewable annually in an amount equal to 50 percent of the current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the community development director or his designee.
(11)
The petition must include evidence that the property owners' association is empowered to levy assessments against owners on the streets for the payment of expenditures made by the association for maintenance of the private streets and improvements associated with private streets, including, but not limited to, sidewalks, bikeways, curbs and gutters, traffic signs and markings, associated landscaping and lighting, entry signs, monuments, perimeter walls and fences, entry gates and gatehouses and evidence that any unpaid assessments constitute a lien in favor of the property owners' association on the lot, building, or unit of the owner. At least 15 percent of all fees or assessments paid must be set aside in the maintenance fund.
(12)
The city council may not consider a petition for abandonment unless it:
a.
Contains all of the evidence and documents required by this section;
b.
Is supported by an analysis by the department of public works that shows that the street is no longer used by the public to the extent that it serves no substantial public purpose and that the public at large will benefit from its closure since the public will no longer be responsible for any costs to maintain and repair the street; and
c.
Is supported by an analysis by the department of community development that shows that the abandonment of the street does not negatively impact adjacent neighboring communities and the public at large.
(i)
Street cross-sections. Except as expressly stated in a city-adopted plan (e.g., Dunwoody Village) or within the city's standards and specifications, all streets must be designed and constructed in substantial compliance with the regulations of the table below. Modifications of this table may be approved by the community development director based on contextual constraints.

Right-of-way and street improvements.
(1)
All proposed new streets must be designed and built in accordance with the standards listed in this article and the city's standards and specifications.
(2)
Streets must have a minimum right-of-way width that complies with the comprehensive transportation plan and that will safely accommodate motorized and nonmotorized transportation improvements and street cross-sections needed to provide appropriate, safe and adequate access to the subject property, in accordance with the city's standards and specifications. Where a proposed subdivision or project requiring a land development permit has frontage on an existing public street, right-of-way must be dedicated to meet the requirements of this section. The right-of-way must be improved wherever required as further provided in this section. For existing streets on which a proposed subdivision or project requiring a land development permit has frontage, the applicant must:
a.
Dedicate a minimum of 50 percent of the required right-of-way width as measured from the centerline of the existing street right-of-way;
b.
Install all required sidewalks, street trees, streetlights, and place utilities in accordance with the standards in this article; and
c.
Provide a minimum of 50 percent of the roadway pavement required in this article and install it to the right-of-way centerline.
(3)
Land reserved for any road purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements on the city zoning ordinance where the land is to be dedicated to the public in fee simple or an easement associated with the road is granted to the city.
(4)
Right-of-way dedication and road widening must extend for the full length of road frontage of the property under development and must conform to the standards in these regulations. Flares at pavement ends may be required to extend beyond property under development.
(5)
The city council, after considering all related factors, may authorize deviations from this section as follows:
a.
Right-of-way dedication may be waived or modified if existing government plans for the roadway indicate lesser right-of-way would be required for dedication.
b.
Road improvements may be waived or modified if:
1.
Existing use of property not to be substantially changed (i.e., traffic generation and ingress/egress would remain the same);
2.
Governmental construction plans for the road indicate a pavement width less than city standards (only the planned pavement width is required);
3.
Widening would create a hazard to motorized or nonmotorized traffic.
c.
The applicant may, with written concurrence of the community development director, provide payment to the city in lieu of road improvements when:
1.
Road improvements by state or local action are scheduled within 24 months;
2.
Existing utility companies' improvements are situated so as to require their removal or relocation before road improvements should be accomplished;
3.

(d)
Surface drainage.
(1)
The size, length and location of all surface drainage pipes or structures must be shown on the final subdivision plats and subject to the approval of the public works department. All storm drain pipes or culverts carrying stormwater from the street and adjacent property between or through lots must be extended to at least 30 feet behind the rear of the house. Stormwater must be released into a channel without causing scouring, erosion or resulting sedimentation to the receiving channel. When necessary, the outlet channel must include structural and vegetative measures to ensure non-erosion velocities. This requirement for pipe extension only applies to the discharge ends of piped systems.
a.
An exception to extending pipes 30 feet behind the rear of the house may be made for pipes 54 inches and larger where the house site is proposed to be more than 30 feet from the center of the drainageway.
b.
An exception to extending pipes 30 feet behind the rear of the house may be granted by the city when soil conditions prohibit erosion.
c.
An exception to extending pipes 30 feet behind the rear of the house may be granted by the city where lots are at least one acre in size, open channels are provided, and neither ponding nor erosion control will result.
(2)
Installation, backfilling and compaction must be in accordance with state transportation department specifications, sections 106 and 520. All pipes must have a minimum cover of one foot and headwalls or inlet basins constructed at the end of each pipe.
(3)
The design of drainage structures must be based on recognized hydrological formulas as outlined in the Stormwater Management Manual.
(4)
A contour map with an interval of two feet must be submitted as part of preliminary plats. As determined by the community development director, any lots within the subdivision which are undesirable for building due to bad drainage conditions must be excluded, and no building is permitted thereon until these conditions have been corrected as specified by the community development director.
(e)
Plans and profiles. Three copies and one electronic/digital copy of the complete plans and profiles for subdivision street improvements must be submitted for review and recommendation of approval or denial by the public works department prior to approval of the final plat.
(f)
Financial guarantees.
(1)
If, at the time the final plat is submitted for approval, the construction of the street improvements has not been accomplished, then the final plat must be disapproved. No performance bonds may be allowed or authorized except the community development director may require a performance bond to be filed with the city to ensure that all final road improvements required by this Code are made by the owner or applicant. The city may not accept a road until such time as all road improvements required by the city are made.
(2)
After the work has been completed in accordance with the city specifications and duly inspected by the city, then a maintenance bond is required, equal to ten percent of the estimated construction cost. The proposed maintenance bond must be reviewed and approved as to form by the city attorney prior to acceptance by the city. The maintenance bond must cover the street improvements, drainage system, water system and sewer system. Funds may be placed in escrow with the city in lieu of maintenance bonds.
(3)
The applicant must sign a maintenance agreement with the city, by which the applicant must agree to maintain the streets, drainage, water quality BMPs, water and sewer systems, and rights-of-way for a period of 12 months. During the applicant maintenance period, the city must make inspections and instruct the applicant by letter as to what correction must be made.
(4)
In case of emergency repairs, which must be made immediately, or required corrections, which are not made within 30 days of notice, the city must have the authority to make these corrections and recover costs from the applicant. In cases where funds are being held in escrow by the city, the cost of making these corrections must be deducted from these funds, and the applicant charged with any costs above the amount of escrow funds.
(5)
At the end of the 12-month applicant maintenance period, the city must make a final inspection and notify the applicant and the bonding company of any corrections to be made. If the work is acceptable, the community development director must recommend to the city attorney that all remaining escrow funds be released; provided, however, in the discretion of the community development director, based upon:
a.
Weather conditions;
b.
Labor market;
c.
Material market; or
d.
Circumstances beyond the control of the applicant or the city unforeseen by either party.
(6)
The maintenance period may be extended for a definite period of time sufficient to make the necessary corrections by an agreement in writing executed by the city, the applicant and his surety. Provided, further, that the applicant is responsible for any damages done to work already completed by him to the time of the extension agreement whether or not the city had accepted it.
(7)
Maintenance bonds and acceptance by the city of any dedicated improvements must be as one package upon completion of all improvements, even though the final plat may have been approved prior to completion.
(g)
Standard plans and specifications. Standard city plans and specifications referred to in this part are on file and may be obtained from the community development department.
(h)
Sidewalks and bicycle lanes.
(1)
Sidewalks are required on all sides of all new street frontages and on the subject side of all improved streets in all subdivisions and as set forth in subsection 16-223(j), unless the community development director determines that a deferral or fee in lieu is approved in accordance with section 16-221.
(2)
At a minimum continuous sidewalks are required on at least one side of all new and improved local residential streets. No other variances or exceptions are allowed.
(3)
The community development director may require that sidewalks be extended to the nearest arterial or collector street.
(4)
A grassed, planted or landscaped strip, as set forth in this article, must separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs, bridges excepted. The community development director may approve a variable sidewalk location and landscape strip width based on site conditions and future road expansions. Where sidewalks currently exist, new sidewalk construction or reconstruction must be continuous with existing sidewalks.
(5)
Sidewalks must be installed at the same time as the building construction, unless an alternative method is approved by the community development director. Sidewalks must be completed prior to the issuance of certificate of occupancy for property on which the sidewalk fronts. The sidewalk plan must be recorded on the final plat and all sidewalks completely installed prior to approval of the final plat.
(6)
Sidewalks may not be cut, removed or closed temporarily without a permit from the public works department. Such permit may not be issued unless safe, adequate, and convenient provision is made for nonmotorized travel through the area that is disrupted. Damage to sidewalks caused during construction or development activity must be repaired at no cost to the city within 30 days or prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, whichever is earlier.
(7)
All sidewalk construction and repairs must provide for wheelchair ramps to and from sidewalks at the intersection of each street corner and crosswalk. Access ramps must be constructed pursuant to standards approved by the public works department.
a.
All driveways with sidewalks and sidewalk crosswalk installations are required to be constructed in accordance with the accessible sidewalk standards published by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, in FHWA-SA-03-01 as amended.
(8)
Sidewalks may not be constructed on any street in the city without first obtaining a permit to do so from the public works department. Any person constructing a sidewalk on a street, without first obtaining a permit, is in violation of this Code, and the public works department is authorized to condemn the sidewalk and have it removed and replaced at no cost to the city.
(9)
Bicycle lanes are required on new or substantially improved arterials or collector streets where the posted speed limit is 35 miles per hour or greater. Bicycle lanes may also be required by the community development director where necessary to provide connections to bikeways identified on the comprehensive transportation plan or other adopted plan. Bicycle lanes must be constructed as follows:
a.
Bicycle lanes, where required, must be at least four feet wide and placed in the outside lane of a roadway, adjacent to the curb and gutter or shoulder. Curb and gutter areas may not be counted in calculating the width of a bicycle lane. When on-street parking is permitted, bicycle lanes must be at least four feet in width and located between the parking lane and the outer travel lane. Bicycle pavement widths are in addition to the minimum pavement width required for the road.
b.
Bicycle lanes must be delineated with signs and striping consistent with the latest edition of the manual for uniform traffic control devices, and approved by the community development director.
c.
Bikeways and bicycle lanes must be constructed in accordance with the most recent specifications set forth in American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) guidelines.
d.
The design, striping and sign system for bicycle lanes must be coordinated with that of the vehicular road system to provide a safe and continuous route for bicycles. Deceleration lanes must be striped so that bicycles can safely remain in a lane marked between the deceleration lane and the through traffic lane.
(10)
No wall, fence, sign or other structure may obstruct passage along a sidewalk or bicycle lane.
(i)
Parking on right-of-way.
(1)
For residential projects constructed under the provisions of the zoning ordinance as single-family attached residential projects, wherein title to the single-family unit is held by fee simple ownership, the city may assume maintenance responsibility one year after the release of the subdivision bonds for parking constructed on public rights-of-way, in accordance with minimum city standards. A special parking maintenance district, as authorized by Georgia Constitution article IX, § II, ¶ VI, comprised of all property within such single-family attached residential subdivision, may be established by resolution of city council for the maintenance of such parking constructed on the public right-of-way at the time the subdivision plat is finally recorded, provided the plat is so noted.
(2)
Final subdivision plats for single-family attached residential projects must have the following notation when a special district is to be established for city maintenance of parking within the public right-of-way:
"All single-family residential lots on this plat are included in a special taxing district for funding the maintenance of parking provided in the development."
(3)
If the city creates a special parking district, as authorized by Georgia Constitution article IX, § II, ¶ VI, revenue to fund city parking maintenance will be obtained by an ad valorem tax levied on all properties within such parking district. Such ad valorem millage will be set annually by the city council when other ad valorem millage rates are set. No assessment will be made in a special parking district in the calendar year in which it is established.
(j)
Underground utilities. All utilities are required to be placed underground unless the community development director determines that underground utilities are infeasible due to shallow rock, high water table, or other similar geologic or hydrologic conditions.
(k)
Streetlights. Streetlights consistent with Georgia Power specifications are required in all new subdivisions of two or more lots except where no utility improvements are required by this chapter. Streetlights must be provided on the same side of the street as sidewalks.
