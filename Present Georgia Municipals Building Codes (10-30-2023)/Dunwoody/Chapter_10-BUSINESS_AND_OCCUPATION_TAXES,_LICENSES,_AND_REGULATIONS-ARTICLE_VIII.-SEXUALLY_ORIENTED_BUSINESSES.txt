And based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas—1986; Indianapolis, Indiana—1984; Garden Grove, California—1991; Houston, Texas—1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona—1979, 1995-98; Chattanooga, Tennessee—1999-2003; Los Angeles, California—1977; Whittier, California—1978; Spokane, Washington—2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota—1994; Littleton, Colorado—2004; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma—1986; Dallas, Texas—1997; Ft.

(5)
The city council finds:
a.
Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
b.
Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area.
c.
Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
(c)
Adoption of findings subject to adverse secondary effects. The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

(3)
If the decision is to deny, suspend, or revoke the license, the decision shall not become effective until the 30th day after it is rendered, and the decision shall include a statement advising the respondent of the right to appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.

The provisional license shall allow the respondent to continue operation of the sexually oriented business or to continue employment as a sexually oriented business employee and will expire upon the court's entry of a judgment on the respondent's appeal or other action to restrain or otherwise enjoin the city's final administrative decision. The provisional license shall not be construed to provide the applicant with any substantive right, entitlement, or claim of estoppel beyond the ability to continue operation or employment until the court enters judgment on the respondent's appeal or other action to restrain or otherwise enjoin the city's final administrative decision.

(c)
Preexisting sexually oriented businesses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Code, a nonconforming sexually oriented business, lawfully existing in all respects under law prior to the effective date of this article, may continue to operate for one year following that date in order to make a reasonable recoupment of its investment in its current location. At the conclusion of said one year, the use will no longer be recognized as a lawful nonconforming use, except that a nonconforming sexually oriented business may obtain an extension of the original one-year period upon a showing of financial hardship. An application for an extension based upon financial hardship ("hardship exception") shall be made at least 60 days before the conclusion of the aforementioned one-year period.

Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be provided to the applicant via certified mail at least ten days before the hearing. At the hearing, all parties shall have the right to offer testimony, documentary and tangible evidence bearing on the issues; may be represented by counsel, and shall have the right to confront and cross examine witnesses.
(e)
Issuance, grounds for hardship extension. The hearing officer shall issue a written decision within ten days after the hearing on the application for a hardship extension. The hardship extension shall be granted upon a showing of financial hardship. Such a showing shall be established if the hearing officer makes the following findings:
(1)
The applicant has, prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, made a substantial investment, including but not limited to lease obligations incurred in an arms-length transaction, in the property or structure on or in which the nonconforming use is conducted;
(2)
The applicant will be unable to recoup said investment as of the date established for termination of the use; and
(3)
The applicant has made good faith efforts to recoup the investment prior to the conclusion of the one-year period.
Any extension granted under the provisions of this section shall be for a reasonable period of time commensurate with the investment involved.
