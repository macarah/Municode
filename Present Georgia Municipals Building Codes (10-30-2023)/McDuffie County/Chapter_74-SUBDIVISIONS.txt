ARTICLE II. - PROCEDURES FOR PLAT APPROVAL

Sec. 74-31. - Prior considerations.
Prior to initial application for development of a proposed subdivision within the county, consideration should be given to the major issues and requirements which will impact the design and development of the subdivision and the resulting cost of construction. Such issues include, but are not limited to:
(1)
Suitability of land. Land which is deemed by the planning commission to be unsuitable for development will be denied for development, or, the developer will be required to initiate or incorporate mitigating measures to render the land suitable for development. Land considered as unsuitable for development includes, but is not limited to:
a.
Flooding. Land subject to flooding, deemed by observation to be located in floodplains, and land designated as flood prone as indicated on the FEMA Floodplain map of McDuffie County.
b.
Wetlands. Land which is designated as wetlands by existing map resources or identified on-site by a qualified consultant.
c.
Poor drainage. Land which is considered unsuitable due to poor drainage.
d.
Geologic/topographic conditions. Land which possess rock formations or outcroppings, and land having steep slopes, or land which may endanger health, life, or property. Land development which may aggravate erosion, increase flood hazard, or necessitate excessive expenditures of public funds for supply and maintenance of services.
e.
Predetermined unsuitable. Land which other public agencies have investigated and found, in the best interest of the public, not suitable for the type of platting and development proposed. Such lands shall not be approved for subdivision unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer for meeting the problems created by subdivision of such land.
f.
General. Land which is considered unsuitable due to scattered or premature subdivision of land which would endanger health, safety or property because of lack of, or adverse effect on, water supply, schools, proper drainage, transportation, other public services or public funds for the supply or maintenance of such services.
(2)
Design costs. Developers with little or no prior experience in subdivision development will encounter significant engineering and surveying cost and time relating to the design, submittal, and applicable resubmittal of subdivision design plans.
(3)
Land/improvements. Developers will encounter significant costs in acquiring the land for the subdivision, designing the subdivision to county design requirements, the purchase and installation of the subdivision infrastructure and improvements including paved roadways, sidewalks, municipal water and sewer, underground electrical service, street lights, green spaces/greenways, recreation areas, landscaping, and drainage facilities such as drop inlets, storm water piping and detention basins.
(4)
Compliance fees. Developers will experience associated cost in complying with pertinent federal, state, and local regulations such as wetland mitigation, county review fees, state erosion and sediment control (E&S) review and fees, state/federal NPDES fees.
(5)
Responsibility of costs. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or developer to underwrite the total cost of the construction of the subdivision development. The furnishing of performance bonding to gain early release of lots for sale, or other transfer of title, is prohibited.
(Ord. of 6-6-07, § 2.1)
Sec. 74-32. - Preliminary consultation.
Initially, and prior to the submittal of any preliminary plat, all subdividers or developers are required to meet with the director of the planning commission, director of public works, the county's environmental health specialist, and other applicable representatives to review the county's requirements for subdivision development. The subdivider/developer should submit a draft scaled sketch of the proposed subdivision along with data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity and the proposed layout and development of the subdivision. It is not necessary to produce engineered plans at this time. No fee shall be charged for this informal consultation, and no formal application is anticipated. The informal consultation will cover the development and design requirements and issues applicable to the proposed development. After consultation, and upon approval by the planning commission, the owner/developer may draft and submit a preliminary plat as described below.
(Ord. of 6-6-07, § 2.2)
Sec. 74-33. - Submittal of preliminary plat.
(a)
Plat requirements and improvements. Prior to the submittal of a preliminary plat the subdivider/developer should first reference and become familiar with the zoning district design requirements found in the McDuffie County Land Development Code (zoning ordinance) for the zoning district in which the property is to be developed. The subdivider/developer is required to comply with those plat requirements noted herein which must be incorporated into the subdivision plans.
(b)
Plan submittal. The subdivider/developer shall submit to the planning commission preliminary plat sets, the number of which shall be determined by the planning commission, along with a subdivision review fee in an amount as approved by the board of commissioners. The submittal of a preliminary plat to the planning commission for review neither constitutes an application for board review, nor conveys developmental rights to the subdivider/developer which are conveyed only upon approval of the preliminary plat by the board of commissioners.
(c)
Plan review. At such time as the owner or developer submits to the planning commission a preliminary plat and any additional documentation as is required by the planning commission, and upon receipt of all applicable fees, the staff shall review the preliminary plat for conformity with the provisions of this chapter. The planning commission shall not accept an application for board review of a preliminary subdivision plan unless, in their judgment, it is found to comply with all applicable required plan elements and required subdivision improvements. The developer should note that the review of the preliminary plat by the planning commission does not include or cover the state's review undertaken by the local NRCS office for erosion and sedimentation control, or the review by the local environmental health specialists regarding the use of well and septic tanks. Upon completion of the planning commission review the planning commission staff shall inform the developer of the results of the review and any subsequent actions necessary to bring the plat into conformity with the requirements of this chapter.
(d)
Application to planning commission board.
(1)
Application without variance request(s). After review by the planning commission, should the preliminary plat be found to be in full compliance with the provisions of this chapter, without the necessity or intent of application by the developer for the granting of a variance, the review of the preliminary plat by the planning commission board shall neither be necessary nor required. The preliminary plat shall be forwarded by the planning commission directly to the board of commissioners for review.
(2)
Application with variance request(s). After review by the planning commission, should the preliminary plat fail to be in full compliance with the provisions with this chapter, and it is the intent of the developer to apply for variances from the provisions of this chapter, the developer is required to first submit a preliminary plat of the subdivision which shall be in full compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The developer shall concurrently submit a second plat ("variance plat") which shall clearly indicate any variances or deviations which are being sought by the developer. After staff review of both plats the subdivider/developer will be directed to submit an application for preliminary plat review before the planning commission board, and the board of commissioners thereafter. Such application shall be made by such date as is designated as the application cut-off date for such board review.
[Advertising] Applications for variances from the subdivision regulations shall require a public notice to be advertised in the local newspaper of general circulation not less than fifteen (15) days prior to such review in a form as approved by the planning commission. Unless otherwise authorized by the planning commission, notice of such application by on-site signage shall not be required. developers should contact the planning commission for guidance on the characteristics, design, and makeup of the "variance plat" sheet(s).
(e)
Planning commission board action. Upon presentation to the planning commission board of the "compliant" and "variance" plats the planning commission staff shall report their findings, recommendations, and developer's requests for variances. The board shall review the application and thereafter recommend approval of the preliminary plat, with or without conditions, or denial of the preliminary plat. The board shall, in addition, have the opportunity of forwarding the plats to the board of commissioners without action or recommendation, or to postpone their decision. If action on a preliminary plat(s) is not taken by the planning commission board within 62 days from the date of the first hearing, the planning commission shall be considered as having taken "no action" whereupon the preliminary plat shall thereafter be forwarded to the board of commission for review. In addition to the 62 days, additional time may be granted for review of the plats if agreed upon by the applicant. The final action or recommendation of the planning commission board shall be conveyed to the county commission clerk who shall then place the subdivision plat on the agenda for review by the board of commissioners.
(f)
Board of commissioner review. The board of commissioners upon review of the preliminary plat shall consider the action or recommendation of the planning commission board and any additional comments or information pertaining to the application. The board of commissioners, after giving due consideration to the application, shall render a final declaration as to the approval, with or without conditions, or denial of the plat. The board of commissioners shall, in addition, have the opportunity to postpone their decision. However, if final action is not taken by the board within 93 days of the date of the first hearing before the board of commissioners, the preliminary plat shall be considered as approved. In addition to the 93 days, additional time for review may be granted if agreed upon by the applicant. Approval of the preliminary plat by the board of commissioners shall constitute authorization for the subdivider to begin construction of the subdivision in accordance with the approved preliminary plat. Any deviation from the approved plan which is found during construction, or prior to approval of the final or as built plat, shall immediately be addressed by appropriate corrective action and approved by the planning commission or board of commissioners. The subdivider, subdivision owner or agent, shall not transfer, sell, or negotiate to sell any lots, areas, or phases of the subdivision, by reference or exhibition, except upon approval of the final or as built plat. Should the subdivision plat not be approved, the planning commission staff or board of commissioners shall notify the applicant setting forth the causes or reasons for such denial.
(g)
Post approval actions.
(1)
Preliminary plat status change. It shall be understood by the owner/developer that, upon approval of a preliminary plat, time is of the essence. Upon approval it is incumbent upon the subdivider/developer to begin development and construction of the subdivision in an expeditious manner. if it is determined by the planning commission that continuous development activity of or within the subdivision, or of a subdivision phase, has ceased, or is otherwise in a state of inactivity for a period of six (6) months, the planning commission is authorized to declare the status of the construction of the subdivision, and therefore the subdivision plat, as "inactive". Should a subdivision receive the status of "inactive" the developer shall be notified in writing by regular post, addressed to his/her last known address of record, that the preliminary plat and subdivision development is considered as inactive and that all development permits and approvals shall are considered suspended until such time as the developer or subdivider shall apply for a "reactivated" status. The procedure for reactivation shall be by application to and on such forms as prescribed by the planning commission.
(2)
Reactivation and conformity. Prior to such time as the owner or developer shall apply for the status of "active" or "reactivated", the preliminary plat, and therefore the project addressed by said plat may be subject to being brought into conformity with any current standards of planning, construction, or engineered design at such time as the project and plat is considered for reactivation.
(3)
Exemption (grandfathered plats). Subdivision preliminary plats which have received approval from the board of commissioners prior to the adoption of this chapter shall be considered as "grandfathered" and shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.
(4)
Division prohibited. Upon adoption of this chapter by the board of commissioners, the further division of any lot, tract, or other parcel within any subdivision in McDuffie County is thereafter prohibited regardless of the date of development.
(Ord. of 6-6-07, § 2.3)

(b)
Road/street names. Road/street names shall not duplicate existing street names, irrespective of the use of the suffixes such as street, avenue, boulevard, road, pike, drive, way, place, court, or other derivatives which must also be approved by the planning commission. The planning commission can assist the subdivider in avoiding duplication and in coordinating the names of streets. Approved street signs shall be placed at all intersections. Proposed streets which are continuations of, or are in alignment with existing streets shall bear the names of existing streets. Streets whose intersection or "curves" approximate a right angle 90° may, as directed by the planning commission, be required to be assigned a different name.
(Ord. of 6-6-07, § 3.1)
Sec. 74-102. - Street classification.

(2)
Secondary artery. County roads which are by traffic volume and speed 45—55 m.p.h. are designated as such by the planning commission.
(3)
Collector roads/streets. Roads, as designated by the planning commission as having a lower traffic volume than an arterial road, and have a lower required speed 25—45 m.p.h. and serve to facilitate the movement of traffic between land service streets and arterial roads.
(4)
Land service streets. Roads/streets which facilitate the movement of traffic directly from land lots to collector roads, and which require the lowest traffic speed 15—25 m.p.h.
(b)
Classification by use:
(1)
Residential.
a.
Small lot subdivisions (proposed): (Zone: R-3) (Proposed: Lots = .40 acre, but generally < .50 acre with min. frontage of 75 feet).
b.

It shall be the responsibility of the owner, developer, or subdivider to pave such roads unless otherwise approved by the board of commissioners.
(c)
Layout of new streets. The proposed street system within a subdivision shall be determined by the planning commission to adequately balance the privacy of the future occupants with the free flow of traffic within the county, and to adequately provide for access for public safety by fire, police and emergency medical vehicles, and for school buses. In making such determination, satisfaction of the following requirements shall be considered by the planning commission:
(1)
In the opinion of the planning commission where it is necessary to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication and improvement of right-of-way to the boundary of such property.
(2)
Unless approved otherwise by the planning commission, a subdivision shall provide a street connection to each public street that it adjoins, and shall provide direct or indirect continuity through the subdivision between each connection.
(3)
The proposed street layout should be designed to minimize cut and fill within the right-of-way to provide better access to the subdivision lots. The design should also minimize the area of tree removal required for installation of streets, utilities and drainage features in order to reduce the number of large trees removed during construction.
(d)
Interval of intersection with arteries. Subdivision streets which intersect a county arterial road shall do so at intervals not less than the following:
(1)
Primary artery, 1,000 feet;
(2)
Secondary artery, 600 feet.

(c)
Street development. Every subdivision lot or parcel shall have access to a street system which shall be designed and engineered according to the design criteria contained in this chapter, article III herein, and such criteria as referenced below.
(1)
Preparation of right-of-way. The full width of all roadways shall be prepared so that pavement, sidewalks, and other required improvements may be constructed in such a manner that future extension of additional utilities or street improvements will not damage yards of abutting property. Abutting property shall be suitably sloped to the right-of-way line. Due regard shall be shown for desirable trees not impairing visibility.
(2)
Preparation of subgrade. Before grading is started, the entire area to be paved shall first be cleared of all stumps, roots, brush and other objectionable materials. In all areas to be graded or filled, the subdivider shall stockpile the topsoil to be spread later in all disturbed areas not paved.
(3)
Protection of banks. Immediately after grading, filling, and re-spreading of topsoil, all areas of disturbed soil shall be fertilized, seeded, sodded, or otherwise appropriately treated with suitable vegetative cover to retard erosion. The stabilization as evidenced by an adequate stand of grass on all right-of-ways shall be obtained to the satisfaction of the director of public works before approval of the final plat.
(4)
Roadway base. Roadway base material and compaction shall conform to the county's specifications for such, and shall be approved by the director of public works.
(5)
Curb-and-gutter and paving (R). All new streets shall be surfaced by the developer with paving materials as required by county specifications regarding street paving and surface materials. Concrete curbs and gutters shall be required on all new streets and shall be constructed by the subdivision developer in accordance with the county's specifications for curbs and gutters available from the office of the director of public works. Where a subdivision abuts an existing state or county road, the developer shall be required to extend the subdivision's road improvements (paved roadway, curb/gutter, etc) out to, and to improve such public road in compliance with the minimum requirements of this chapter.
(6)
New streets (R). The preparation and development of all new roads shall comply with the county's specifications herein, and shall be approved by the county before such streets may be developed and accepted by the county.
(7)
Turn lanes (R). Center turn lanes may be required at entrances into residential, industrial, and commercial developments which front on arterial streets. Turn lanes shall be 12 feet in width for a minimum distance of 200 feet which distance shall be measured from the intersection of the right-of-way lines. Contact the planning commission for analysis of county roadway at proposed subdivision entrance(s) and the requirements for turn lanes.
(8)
Acel/decel lanes (R). Acel/decal lanes shall be required for all subdivision entrances fronting a primary or secondary arterial roadway, or what is determined by the planning commission to be a major collector road or street of increased speed and traffic flow. Acel/decal lanes shall be constructed to the design criteria as required by the public works director.
(9)
Number of entrances (R). To facilitate ease of traffic, every subdivision having frontage greater than 2,000 feet on an existing public roadway, or has frontage on multiple county roadways, may be required to provide more than one entrance to such subdivision.
(d)
Sidewalks (R). Concrete sidewalks shall be required for all residential subdivisions, multi-family and PUD developments. Sidewalks may be required in industrial and commercial developments depending on the characteristics and density of the development. Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of the streets to the county's design standards as found in the office of the director of public works and shall be four feet in width and four inches in depth. For standard (upright) curb and gutter, the sidewalk may join or abut the back side of the curb. For roll-top curbing, the front (street) edge of the sidewalk shall be placed not closer than five feet from the back side of the curb. To stabilize the edges of the sidewalk and curbing, turf grass shall be placed in the five-foot area between the back of the curbing and the front edge of the sidewalk. For standard curbing with abutting sidewalk, a single row of turf shall be placed on the back side of the sidewalk. Sidewalks shall not be located less than one-foot from all front property lines to prevent interference or encroachment by fencing, walls, hedges or other plantings or structures placed on the property line at a later date. At street corners and other required locations, sidewalk handicap ramps shall be installed. In addition to interior subdivision sidewalks, sidewalks along exterior roadways or other public right-of-ways shall also be required where deemed by the planning commission as an integral part of a pedestrian traffic system within a one-mile radius of existing or planned schools, neighborhood recreation, or commercial areas, or other public places, and for continuation of existing sidewalks.
(e)
Site improvements. Banks which infringe on sight lines at intersections shall be appropriately graded to correct the deficiency. Wherever grading or filling occurs on lots within the subdivision, the subdivider shall first stockpile the topsoil from the affected areas immediately after grading and filling, and shall redistribute to areas of disturbed soil, sufficient topsoil to support growth of lawn grass and other vegetation, and shall immediately seed such areas with appropriate vegetative cover to prevent erosion, silting of streams and other damages. Due regard shall be shown for such desirable trees which are already on the site, and grading and filling should be planned to preserve as many of such trees possible; however, no retained planting shall infringe on sight lines at intersections. If trees are planted by the subdivider, they shall be located five feet inside or behind property lines where they are less subject to injury, decrease the chances of motor accidents and enjoy more favorable conditions for growth. If trees are to be planted within a planting strip in the right-of-way, the proposed locations and species of such trees to be used must be submitted for the planning commission's approval since the public inherits the care and maintenance of such trees. Where land is platted or reserved for commercial or industrial use bordering or across from residential lots, a suitable buffer planting of trees and shrubs which are approved by the planning commission shall be required, such trees and shrubs shall not infringe on sight lines at intersections where planted.

--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 20-02, § 1, adopted July 1, 2020, in effect repealed and replaced art. VI, §§ 74-251—74-253, and enacted a new art. VI, §§ 74-251—74-253. Former art. VI pertained to similar subject matter and derived from an Ord. adopted June 6, 2007.

Sec. 74-251. - Dedication of subdivision improvements.
To ensure the proper installation and maintenance of all subdivision improvements prior to the county accepting same, the following requirements shall be met:
(1)
Request of dedication of subdivision improvements. After the installation and completion of subdivision improvements including roadways, rights-of-way, or other subdivision improvements that subdivision developer intends to dedicate to the county, the subdivision developer or owner shall request the public works director, planning commission, and other applicable departments to make a final inspection of the subdivision improvements. Should any defects exist, they shall be immediately remedied, after which a final inspection shall again be requested. Upon inspection approval, the subdivision owner or developer shall request in writing that the subdivision improvements be dedicated to, and accepted by, the county board of commissioners. Formal written requests to the board of commissioners shall be submitted to the county planning commission.
(2)
The board of commissioners may require the developer/owner to maintain in force a performance bond or other equivalent form of approved security securing such subdivision improvements.
(Ord. No. 20-02, § 1, 7-1-20)
Sec. 74-252. - Assurance of continued maintenance.
The developer maintenance period shall be 12 months from the date of acceptance of any or all improvements dedicated to the county. In such cases where it shall be appropriate, the developer maintenance period for any or all improvements dedicated to the county within a development shall be extended 12 months from the completion of all phases in the development and acceptance of all improvements dedicated to the county.
(1)
Maintenance assurance. In order to protect the county from faulty improvements, the subdivision developer or owner shall be required to keep all subdivision roadways, rights-of-way, required traffic signs and signals, and all other subdivision improvements in good repair during the developer maintenance period, and any extensions thereof. The developer maintenance period shall last 12 months from the date the county board of commissioners formally accepts subdivision improvements, except in such cases where development occurs in phases. If the development is completed in phases, the developer maintenance period shall last 12 months after the last phase has been completed and the improvements are dedicated to the county. As an assurance of such continued maintenance the governing authority or its designee will require a bond or other equivalent form of approved security, in a minimum amount of $5,000.00 or any amount equal to at least ten percent of the actual construction cost of all improvements to be dedicated to the county, whichever is greater, until the owner or developer has satisfied the requirements of the developer maintenance period.
(2)
Extension of developer maintenance period. During the developer maintenance period, if upon inspection of subdivision improvements the county determines that work or repairs are needed in order for the subdivision improvements to meet county specifications or requirements, the subdivision developer or owner shall be notified in writing by the department of the deficiencies. Thereafter, the subdivision developer or owner shall extend the maintenance bond one year and shall have 60 days from receipt of such notification to correct such deficiencies. If the deficiencies are not corrected within such time, then the bond or other equivalent form of approved security posted by the subdivision developer or owner shall be, if approved by the board of commissioners, forfeited and called upon up to the cost of repairs or the total amount of the bond. Should the amount of the bond be inadequate to pay for the cost of correcting the deficiencies, then the subdivision developer or owner shall pay any and all costs beyond bond coverage. The developer maintenance period shall be extended by the number of days required for correction of the deficiencies and inspection and acceptance by the county of the repairs.
(Ord. No. 20-02, § 1, 7-1-20)
Sec. 74-253. - Variances.
(a)
Board variances. The planning commission board may recommend, and, the board of commissioners may authorize, variances from the requirements and minimum design standards contained in this chapter provided the subdivider submits to the planning commission a specific request for such which shall include specific and detailed justifications why such variance(s) should be granted, and shows to the satisfaction of the boards that strict compliance to these requirements would cause an overwhelming burden of hardship to the developer. The recommending of any variances by the planning commission board, and the granting of any variance by the board of commissioners, shall be stated in the minutes of the respective board meeting with the reasons for which the departure was justified and the conditions under which such variance was granted. Mere inconvenience, financial or otherwise, shall not constitute authorization for an application for a variance.
(1)
Variance plat. At such time as a preliminary plat is authorized to be submitted for review, if it is the intent of the developer to seek variances from the required subdivision improvements as referenced in article IV, a second or "variance plat" shall be drafted showing the design of the subdivision incorporating such requested variances.
(b)
Administrative variances. The director of the planning commission is hereby authorized to grant variances in the dimensional requirements of this chapter provided the purpose and intent of this chapter is maintained.
