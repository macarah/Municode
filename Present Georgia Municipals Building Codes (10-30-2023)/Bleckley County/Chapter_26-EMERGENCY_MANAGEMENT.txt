Sec. 26-2. - Emergency management and response powers.
(a)
Declaration of local emergency.
(1)
Grant of authority. In the event of an actual or threatened occurrence of a disaster or emergency, which may result in the large-scale loss of life, injury, property damage or destruction or in the major disruption of routine community affairs, business or governmental operations in the county and which is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant extraordinary assistance by federal, state and local departments and agencies to supplement the efforts of available public and private resources, the county commissioner may declare a local emergency for the county. The form of the declaration shall be similar to that provided in subsection (b).
(2)
Request for state assistance. Consistent with a declaration of local emergency, the county commissioner may request the governor to provide assistance, provided that the disaster or emergency is beyond the capacity of the county to meet adequately and state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster.
(3)
Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the county commissioner finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time, the commissioner shall execute and file with the clerk of the county commissioner a document marking the end of the state of emergency. No state of local emergency shall continue longer than 30 days, unless renewed by the commissioner. The commissioner may, by resolution, end a state of local emergency at any time.
(4)
Effect of declaration of emergency.
a.
Activation of emergency operations plan. A declaration of emergency by the governor or a declaration of local emergency by the commissioner shall automatically activate the county emergency operations plan and shall be the authority for deployment of personnel and use of any forces to which the plan applies and for use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, materials, and facilities assembled, stockpiled or arranged to be made available pursuant to the state's emergency management act or any other laws applicable to emergencies or disasters.
1.
The Cochran-Bleckley Emergency Management Agency ("EMA") Director shall have the legal authority to exercise the powers and discharge the duties conferred upon the emergency management agency, including the implementation of the emergency operations plan, coordination of the emergency responses of public and private agencies and organizations, coordination of recovery efforts with state and federal officials, and inspection of emergency or disaster sites.
2.
In responding and conducting necessary and appropriate investigations, the director or his/her designee is authorized to enter at a reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting sites involved with emergency management functions. The director is authorized to execute a right of entry and/or agreement to use property for these purposes on behalf of the county; however, any such document shall be later presented for ratification at a meeting of the county commissioner.
3.
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his or her official duties.
b.
Emergency powers. Following a declaration of emergency and during the continuance of such state of emergency, the commissioner is authorized to implement local emergency measures to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation under control. In exercising this authority, the commissioner may cause to become effective any of the following sections of this chapter as appropriate: section 26-5 (registration of building and repair services) to become effective if the governor declares a state of emergency; and section 26-6 (closed or restricted areas and curfews). If any of these sections are included in a declaration of local emergency, the same shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the county commissioner and shall be in effect until the declaration of local emergency has terminated.
c.

8.
To suspend any law, code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of county business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any county agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension;
9.
To provide benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes;

(a)
County business. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or county commissioner, the affairs and business of the county may be conducted at places other than the regular or usual location, within or outside of the county, when it is not prudent, expedient or possible to conduct business at the regular location. When such meetings occur outside of the county, all actions taken by the commissioner shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the county. Such meetings may be called by the presiding officer or any two members of the governing body without regard to or compliance with time-consuming procedures and formalities otherwise required by law.
Note— Local legislation should be reviewed to determine whether there are restrictions upon moving the meeting location if it is only a locally declared emergency and not a state of emergency declared by the governor.
(b)
Public works contracts. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or county commissioner, the commissioner may contract for public works without letting such contract out to the lowest, responsible bidder and without advertising and posting notification of such contract for four weeks; provided, however, that the emergency must be of such nature that immediate action is required and that the action is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

Temporary dwellings. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or county commissioner, the commissioner or its designees may issue temporary mobile home, trailer, recreational vehicle or other temporary dwelling structures or parks in any zoning district, even though not otherwise permitted by development code, while the primary dwelling is being repaired, provided that such temporary dwellings or parks are designed by an engineer and the plans are approved by the county health department and development services. The temporary permit shall not exceed six months in duration.

Each day any such entity does business in the unincorporated areas of the county without complying with this article constitutes a separate offense.
(b)
The cost of registration fees in a declared emergency or disaster is fixed at $100.00 per annum. Registration is nontransferable. The cost of the emergency building permit shall be equal to the cost for a building permit under existing regulations. The permit shall only be authorized for repairs.
