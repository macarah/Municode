Sec. 26-2. - Emergency management and response powers.
(a)
Declaration of local emergency.
(1)
Grant of authority. In the event of an actual or threatened occurrence of a disaster or emergency, which may result in the large-scale loss of life, injury, property damage or destruction or in the major disruption of routine community affairs, business or governmental operations in the county and which is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant extraordinary assistance by federal, state and local departments and agencies to supplement the efforts of available public and private resources, the county commissioner may declare a local emergency for the county. The form of the declaration shall be similar to that provided in subsection (b).
(2)
Request for state assistance. Consistent with a declaration of local emergency, the county commissioner may request the governor to provide assistance, provided that the disaster or emergency is beyond the capacity of the county to meet adequately and state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster.
(3)
Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the county commissioner finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time, the commissioner shall execute and file with the clerk of the county commissioner a document marking the end of the state of emergency. No state of local emergency shall continue longer than 30 days, unless renewed by the commissioner. The commissioner may, by resolution, end a state of local emergency at any time.

In responding and conducting necessary and appropriate investigations, the director or his/her designee is authorized to enter at a reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting sites involved with emergency management functions. The director is authorized to execute a right of entry and/or agreement to use property for these purposes on behalf of the county; however, any such document shall be later presented for ratification at a meeting of the county commissioner.
3.
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his or her official duties.
b.
Emergency powers. Following a declaration of emergency and during the continuance of such state of emergency, the commissioner is authorized to implement local emergency measures to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation under control. In exercising this authority, the commissioner may cause to become effective any of the following sections of this chapter as appropriate: section 26-5 (registration of building and repair services) to become effective if the governor declares a state of emergency; and section 26-6 (closed or restricted areas and curfews).

8.
To suspend any law, code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of county business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any county agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension;
