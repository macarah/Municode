Sec. 10-19. - Purpose and intent.
The county wishes to control the sale and consumption of malt beverages and wine within its limits and to find additional sources of revenue in order to forestall any tax increase on the people of the county. Further, the county, after giving thorough consideration to all the implications involved, and keeping always in mind the public interest and the welfare of the citizens of the county, deems it advisable to legalize the sale of malt beverages and wine within the unincorporated limits of the county. Therefore, the county will issue wholesale and retail licenses for the sale of malt beverages and wine within the unincorporated areas of said county, subject at all times to regulations and controls to be established by the sole commissioner as set forth in this article and by state law.
