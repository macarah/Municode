ARTICLE IV. - AD VALOREM TAX

Sec. 66-64. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
The sole commissioner has determined that the nonpayment of ad valorem taxes by property owners effectively shifts a greater tax burden to property owners willing and able to pay their share of such taxes.
(b)
The failure to pay ad valorem taxes creates significant barriers to marketability of property and nonjudicial tax foreclosure procedures are inefficient and lengthy, commonly resulting in title to real property that is neither marketable nor insurable.
(c)
Tax delinquency in many instances also results in properties that present health and safety hazards to the public.
(d)
The sole commissioner finds that the alternative to nonjudicial tax foreclosure procedures authorized by the O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-75 through 48-4-81 is an effective means of eliminating health and safety hazards by putting certain tax delinquent properties back in the tax rolls and into productive use.
(Ord. of 8-20-1998)
Sec. 66-65. - Procedure.
In addition to any other rights and remedies provided under state law for the enforcement of tax liens by the county, the collecting officers for taxes may proceed with judicial in rem of tax foreclosures for delinquent taxes in accordance with the provisions of the O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-75 through 48-4-81, and this article shall be sufficient authority for use of the provisions of the judicial tax foreclosure procedures as set out in said state law sections by the appropriate tax collecting officials of the county.
(Ord. of 8-20-1998)
Sec. 66-66. - In rem judicial foreclosures.
(a)
The alternate method of judicial in rem foreclosure procedures as set out in O.C.G.A. 48-4-76—48-4-81 is hereby authorized to be used by the tax commissioner of the county and other tax collecting municipalities of properties located in the county.
(b)
The criteria for the selection of properties to be subject to the provision of judicial in rem tax foreclosures include the following:
(1)
When it appears that the taxes will not be paid before sale or the property will not be redeemed before the end of the redemption period.
(2)
When the taxes are owed on an estate or the property has title problems.
(3)
When dealing with a tract of land that could be deemed as an excessive levy.
(4)
When the property is suitable to be acquired by a land bank authority.
(5)
When there are environmental problems associated with the property.
