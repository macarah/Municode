DIVISION 2. - ETHICS

Sec. 2-84. - Declaration of policy.
(a)
It is the policy of the city that the proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all city officials is adopted.
(b)
This code has the following purposes:
(1)
To encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials;
(2)
To establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts and actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the city;

To require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interests in matters that affect the city; and

Sec. 2-86. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
City official or official, unless otherwise expressly defined, does not include city employees, but does mean the mayor, members of the city council, city manager, city clerk, and all appointed officers and persons holding positions designated by the city Charter. The term "city official" or "official" also includes all individuals, including city employees, appointed by the mayor and/or city council, as appropriate, to city authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can or may vote or take formal action or make official recommendations to the city council.
Decision means any ordinance, resolution, contract, franchise, formal action or other matter voted on by the mayor and council or other city boards or commissions, as well as discussions or deliberations of the mayor and council, board or commission which can or may lead to a vote or formal action by that body.
Discretionary authority means the power to exercise any judgment in a decision or action.
Entity means a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited partnership, firm, corporation, professional corporation, holding company, joint stock company, receivership, trust or any other entity recognized by law through which business may be conducted.

The term "interest" does not mean an interest of a person or entity, including a city official, which would be affected in the same way as the general public. The interest of a councilmember in the property tax rate, general city fees, or a comprehensive zoning ordinance or similar decisions is incidental to the extent that the city official would be affected in common with the general public; therefore, such interest shall not be deemed a conflict of interest where the official must refrain from participation.
Member means an elected member of the city council, or any individual, including city employees, appointed by the mayor and/or city council, as appropriate, to city authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can or may vote or take formal action or make official recommendations to the city council.
