Sec. 4-270. - Transferability of alcoholic beverages licenses; fee required to change establishment owner, manager, partnership, stockholders, or establishment name.
(a)
License transferability. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all alcoholic beverage licenses shall be personal to the owner or owners and shall not be transferable.
(b)
Death of an individual owner. In case of the death of an owner of an establishment, no sale of alcoholic beverages shall be allowed until such time as a personal representative of the estate, appointed by a probate court of competent jurisdiction, shall apply to the city clerk for authorization to continue sales notwithstanding the death of the owner. Upon submission of an application, together with an application fee in the amount established by the city, the establishment shall be allowed to operate for a period of 60 days from the date of death, until expiration of the license, or until the approval of a new license under this subsection (b), whichever shall first occur. In the event an application for a new license is submitted pursuant to this subsection (b), it shall be reviewed and acted upon notwithstanding the drawing provisions of section 4-266(c), which will not be applicable. By way of explanation, in the event of the death of an owner, the personal representative of the estate, a devisee or an heir, whichever is appropriate, may apply for and obtain (if qualified) a new license in the place and stead of the license previously held by the deceased and the grant of a license to this individual shall not trigger the drawing process set forth in section 4-266(c), nor shall it entitle others to apply. Upon issuance of a new license pursuant to this subsection (b), the previous license shall be revoked by operation of law. No additional license fee shall be required during the period for which the original license was issued. The owner of a new license issued under this subsection (b) shall be entitled to reapply annually for a renewal license in the same manner as the prior deceased owner.
(c)
Sale of establishment by business entity.
(1)
If an owner who is not an individual (i.e., a corporation, limited liability company, general partnership, limited partnership, or limited liability partnership) desires to sell all of its interest in a licensed establishment (either by the sale of all assets or by the sale of all stock or other interests in the business entity which is the owner, as the case may be), the owner shall inform the city clerk in writing of its intent to sell and shall identify the proposed transferee of the license. Upon such notification by the owner, the proposed transferee shall have 15 business days thereafter to submit an application to the city clerk (together with an application fee in the amount established by city and amendable by resolution) in accordance with the requirements of sections 4-265 and 4-266(a). In the event an application is filed pursuant to this subsection, it shall be reviewed and acted upon notwithstanding the drawing provisions of section 4-265(c), which will not be applicable, and the city clerk's receipt of such an application shall not entitle others to apply. Upon receipt of a complete application, the city clerk shall have 15 days following receipt to inform the proposed transferee as to whether or not the application meets the requirements of this ordinance. If the application meets the requirements of this ordinance, upon receipt of joint written instructions from the present license holder and the proposed transferee, the city clerk shall issue a new license to the proposed transferee for the same location and the previous license for the location in issue shall be revoked by operation of law. No additional license fees shall be required during the period for which the original license was issued. The owner of a new license issued under this subsection shall be entitled to reapply annually for a renewal license in the same manner as the prior owner.
(2)
The provisions of this subsection are only applicable to an established location which has been licensed and engaged in business for at least two years.
(d)
Spacing requirements, etc. Provided the establishment met the requirements of section 4-268 at the time of issuance of the original license, the application of a proposed transferee under subsection (b) or (c) of this section shall be deemed to meet the requirements of that section. By way of explanation, if, for example, the establishment was not within 300 feet of any church at the time the initial license was issued, but at the time the application of the new owner or proposed transferee is submitted, the establishment is within 300 feet of a church because a new church has been constructed since the issuance of the original license, this fact shall not disqualify the new owner or transferee from being entitled to a new license.
(e)
Withdrawal from partnership or sale or transfer of minority ownership. Nothing in this section shall prohibit one or more members of a general or a limited partnership holding a license hereunder (i.e., the partnership holds the license) to withdraw from the partnership in favor of one or more of the partners who were partners at the time of the issuance of the license. The occurrence of such event shall not be deemed to be a transfer of ownership in violation of this section. Likewise, nothing in this section shall prohibit any member of a general or a limited partnership holding a license hereunder who owns a minority interest (less than 50 percent) from selling or transferring his interest, but only in the event the partnership holding the license had a majority owner (more than 50 percent) who was previously identified to the city at the time the license was issued and the aforesaid majority owner remains unchanged.
(f)
Sale or transfer of stock under certain circumstances. If the license issued under this chapter is held by a corporation or a limited liability company, if a shareholder or member holding a minority interest (less than 50 percent) in the corporation or limited liability company desires to sell or transfer his shares in the corporation, nothing in this section shall prohibit the same, but only in the event the corporation holding the license had a majority owner (more than 50 percent) who was previously identified to the city at the time the license was issued and the aforesaid majority owner remains unchanged.
(g)
Transfer of location of establishment. Any licensee who desires to transfer the location of an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages within the city shall so notify the city prior to any transfer of location. The mayor and council, or their designee, shall determine whether the new location is in compliance with all provisions of this chapter and state law. No change in the location of a licensed establishment shall be permitted unless the new location complies with all provisions of this chapter. The mayor and council shall have the authority to approve or deny the transfer of location in the same manner that it may approve or deny the issuance of a new license. An investigative fee in the amount established by the city and amendable by resolution shall be paid by the licensee at the time that an application is made for the transfer of an establishment location. Should a transfer of location be approved, with no change of ownership of the business, the license fee paid for the old location shall be applied to the new location.
(h)
Change of establishment name. Any licensee who desires to change the name of an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages within the city shall so notify the city clerk prior to any change of name, and the city clerk shall direct the issuance of a corrected license in replacement of the original license. The application may be denied by the mayor and council upon their finding that the proposed name of the business is the same as or confusingly similar to an existing business or a trade name of another entity. A fee in the amount established by the city and amendable by resolution shall be paid by the licensee at the time that an application is made for the change of an establishment name.
(i)
Change of manager. Any licensee who changes the manager of an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages within the city shall so notify the city clerk within three days of the effective date of such change and shall file with the city clerk such information about the new establishment manager as the city clerk may require. A fee in the amount established by the city and amendable by resolution shall be paid at the time that an application is made for change of an establishment manager and investigation into the manager-designee.

No sales shall be allowed in such establishment, however, until it has been completed in accordance with such plans and is inspected by the city clerk to ensure compliance with city codes.
