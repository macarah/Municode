Secs. 3-1—3-30. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - SIGN ORDINANCE

Sec. 3-31. - Statement of purpose.
(a)
Dublin, Laurens County, Georgia is a rapidly developing community. As our population here and in surrounding counties increases, many new services and businesses are locating in the city. It is important for our citizens and businesses to be able to communicate through the use of signs. This important individual right of speech must be protected and balanced against the rights of the general public. In adopting these sign regulations, it is not the intent and purpose of the Mayor and City Council of the City of Dublin to impose an outright ban on signs, or regulate their content, but instead to:
(1)
Ensure the right of individuals to convey their messages through signs;
(2)
Protect the public health, safety and general welfare;
(3)
Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive land use planning;
(4)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(5)
Maintain the historical and cultural heritage and image of the city;
(6)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(7)
Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(8)
Promote economic development and tourism;
(9)
Protect private property values;
(10)
Promote proper sign maintenance to insure safety and appearance;
(11)
Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs; and
(12)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
(b)
In assessing how to go about the above-described task, the mayor and city council have gathered information from many sources. They have received input from city staff, including the departments of engineering, planning and zoning, legal and police. Mayor and council have given considerable weight to and find the following relevant and useful as to the size, location and quantity of sign structures within the city and how to regulate them in order to achieve the above-stated intents and purposes: University of Georgia Land Use Clinic (2003, June 26); Sign Control on Rural Corridors: Model Provisions and Guidance; Wisconsin Department of Transportation (1994, December); Milwaukee County Stadium Variable Message Sign Study: Impacts of an Advertising Variable Message Sign on Freeway Traffic; Scenic America (2007); Billboards in the Digital Age: Unsafe (and Unsightly) at Any Speed; Scenic America Issue Alert; Nasar, Jack L. and Hong, Xiaodong (1999, September); Visual Preferences in Urban Signscapes; Journal of Environment and Behavior, 31(5), 671-691; Office of Safety Research and Development, Federal Highway Administration (2001, September 11); Research Review of Potential Safety Effects of Electronic Billboards on Driver Attention and Distraction, U.S. Department of Transportation; New York State Department of State, Division of Local Government Services (2006, January); Municipal Control of Signs; James A.

(a)
The sign and sign structure shall be maintained in good repair, structurally sound, with proper anchorage capable of supporting the imposed loads, so as not to pose a threat to the public health, safety or welfare. All structural members shall be maintained free from deterioration, and shall be capable of safely supporting the imposed dead and live loads.
(b)
All exterior surfaces shall be maintained in good condition. Exterior wood surfaces, other than decay-resistant woods, shall be protected from the elements and decay by painting or other protective covering or treatment.

When required, all exposed surfaces of metal or wood shall be protected from the elements and against decay or rust by periodic application of weather-coating materials, such as paint or similar surface treatment. Sign faces shall be maintained in good repair, and shall have neatly painted, posted or otherwise maintained display surfaces, free of defects such as holes, tears, cracks, breaks or missing portions, which are plainly visible from the public right-of-way.
(c)
When a sign or sign structure is found to be in need of maintenance, the code enforcement officer shall issue a notice of violation to the property owner, which shall describe the maintenance issue, and provide a reasonable amount of time to repair the violation.
(d)
If, after receiving the notice of violation, the property owner fails to remedy the maintenance issue within the time provided, it shall be a violation of this article, subject to citation. The code enforcement officer may also institute the appropriate proceeding at law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate such violation, or to require the removal of the sign or sign structure.

Sec. 3-41. - Permits.
(a)
Permit required. Except as otherwise provided herein, it shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, move or convert any sign in the city, or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a sign permit from the building superintendant. These directives shall not be construed to require any permit for change of copy on any sign, replacement of the sign face, nor for the repainting, cleaning or other normal maintenance or repair of a sign or sign structure for which a permit has previously been issued, so long as the sign or sign structure is not enlarged in any way or otherwise modified.
(b)
Application. Sign permits may be applied for by the owner of the property upon which the sign will be located, or by that person or entity's authorized agent. In order to obtain a permit to erect, alter or relocate any sign under the provisions of this article, an applicant therefore shall submit to the building superintendant a sign permit application, which shall set forth in writing a complete description of the proposed sign including:
(1)
The name, address and telephone number of the owner or persons entitled to possession of the sign and of the sign contractor or erector.
(2)
The name, address and telephone number of the owner or lessee of the lot on which the sign is located if different from those designated above.
(3)
The location by street address of the proposed sign structure.
(4)

(6)
Each applicant shall present to the building superintendant on request a certificate of liability insurance prior to the issuance of a sign permit.
(7)
Where the application is for a multiple message sign using electronic lighting as part of the display on the sign face, a copy of the sign manufacturer's specifications for luminosity shall be attached to the application.

Issuance of permit if application in order. It shall be the duty of the building superintendant, upon receipt of a completed application for a sign permit, to examine such plans and specifications and other data and, if the proposed structure is in compliance with the requirements of this section and all other applicable provisions of this article to issue, within thirty (30) days from date of filing, to the applicant a written permit evidencing the applicant's compliance therewith. Sign permits shall be issued in the name of the property owner upon which the sign is to be located. Issuance of the permit shall in no way prevent the building superintendant from later declaring said sign to be nonconforming if the permit is obtained based on false information submitted by the applicant.
(d)
Denial of permit. The city shall deny permits to applicants that submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this article, incomplete applications, and applications containing any false material statements. Should the city deny a permit, the reasons for the denial are to be stated in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested or via hand delivery to the address on the permit application on or before the 30th business day after the city's receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of re-submission, instead of the date of the original submission. No permit shall be denied or revoked, except for due cause, that is, the violation of the provisions of this article, state or federal law related to signage, or the submission of an incomplete application or an application containing false material statements.
(e)
Permit duration. A sign permit shall become null and void if the construction of the sign for which the permit was issued has not begun within a period of six (6) months after the date of issuance and completed within twelve (12) months after date of issuance. No refunds will be made for permit fees paid for permits that expired due to failure to erect a permitted sign. If later an individual desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule applicable at such time.
(f)
Work on illegal signs. No person shall erect or assist in the erection, construction, maintenance, alteration, relocation, repair or painting of, or do any work upon any sign for which a permit has not been obtained. Any such sign shall be illegal and the building superintendent shall order the owner to remove the same immediately. If the owner fails to remove the same within thirty (30) days, the building superintendent shall proceed in accordance with this article.
(g)
Inspection. All signs for which a permit is required by this article are subject to inspection by the building superintendent.
(h)
Revocation. The building superintendent is hereby authorized and empowered to revoke any permit issued by him upon failure of the holder thereof to comply with the provisions of this section within thirty (30) days after notification in writing. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this article, the clerk shall revoke the permit.
(j)
Permit fees. Before any permit is issued under the provisions of this section, the applicant shall pay a fee of forty dollars ($40.00), payable upon application. An application for a ground sign having any sign face of thirty-two (32) square feet or greater in area shall require a permit fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). However, no permit fee shall be required for signs having no electrical connection and a sign face less than thirty-two (32) square feet in area.

The aggrieved party or its agent and the building inspector shall be allowed to present testimony and evidence as to whether the decision should be affirmed, reversed or modified.

Sec. 3-43. - Variances.
Variances shall be limited to the minimum relief necessary to overcome the hardship. No variance shall be granted to allow a greater number of signs than would be allowed if the hardship did not exist. A variance from compliance with the sign regulations of this article shall be limited to the following hardship situations:
Standards:
(1)
Where the proximity of existing signs on adjoining lots causes the subject property to be ineligible, due to spacing requirements, for a sign of the type sought; or
(2)
Where visibility of a conforming sign from the public street and within fifty (50) feet of the proposed sign would be substantially impaired by existing trees, plants, natural features, signs, buildings or structures on a different lot;
(3)
Placement of the sign elsewhere on the lot would not remedy the visual obstruction; and such visibility obstruction was not created by the owner of the subject property; and the variance proposed would not create a safety hazard to traffic; and
(4)
Variance applications shall be submitted to the building inspector and shall be heard by the City of Dublin Board of Zoning Appeals and shall be heard under the same rules governing appeals.
