3.120 - Official Land Use Standards Atlas.
The boundaries shown on the Land Use Standards Atlas Maps, Comprehensive Plan, and this Land Use Standards Ordinance identify the various districts shown above and define the uses allowed within the defined boundaries of each district.
The boundaries are as follows:
EXPAND
Ag Suburban
Rural Residential Crossroads/Neighborhood (Commercial Limited)
Ag/Conservation Highway Commercial (Commercial General)
Estate Residential Institutional/Public (Commercial Limited)
Industrial (Commercial General)
  3.121
Atlas location. The maps upon which the boundaries of the land use standards districts established in Section 3.110 are shown constitute the Official Land Use Standards Atlas. The Official Land Use Standards Atlas is filed in the Office of the Planning Director and is incorporated as a part of this ordinance, and is as much a part of this ordinance as if the information contained therein was set out in full in this ordinance.
3.122
District boundaries. In the event that any uncertainty exists with respect to the intended boundaries of the various land use standards districts as shown on the Official Land Use Standards Atlas, the Planning Director shall make the interpretation using the following rules:
(1)
The land use standards district boundaries are the center lines of roads, alleys, waterways, and rights-of-way unless otherwise indicated. Wherever designation of a boundary line coincides with the location of a road, alley, waterway, or right-of-way, it shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
(2)
Where the land use standards district boundaries do not coincide with the location of roads, alleys, waterways, and rights-of-way, but do coincide with lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
(3)
Where the land use standards district boundaries do not coincide with the location of roads, alleys, waterways, and rights-of-way or lot lines, the land use standards district boundary shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Land Use Standards Atlas.
3.123
Base building line setback requirements. Base building lines are hereby established from which all front, side, and rear yard setbacks are to be measured. For all public roads in Thomas County, the base building line dimension from center line of right-of-way shall be thirty-five (35) feet. When a right-of-way from center line is greater than thirty-five (35) feet, yard setbacks shall be measured from the right-of-way line. Where no right-of-way line can be determined, the base building line dimension shall be measured from the centerline of the road or street.
Section 3.200 - Regulations of general applicability.
3.210 - Uses.
3.211 - Permitted uses.
No structure shall be constructed, built, moved, remodeled, reconstructed, used, nor shall any land be used or occupied except in accordance with the requirements of the land use standards district in which it is located, unless it was a nonconforming use at the time the district was created. See Section 3.261 of this ordinance for nonconformities.
3.212 - Conditional zoning.
The Thomas County Board of Commissioners imposes conditions on any zoning proposal which would be in the interest of public health, safety or welfare.

No structure or land shall be constructed, built, moved, remodeled, reconstructed, used, or occupied as a conditional use except as approved under the provisions of Section 4.300 or a variance from allowed uses established in the land use regulations granted by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners.
3.214 - Limited use (LU) provision.
The limited use provision allows an applicant to request that a certain property be classified as a limited use. In some areas of the County, a particular land use activity selected out of a general land use classification may have less community impact than some of the other uses within that classification. For this reason, an applicant may petition for a land use change of a property to a specified use only (i.e., C1-LU). The limited use must be among the uses permitted in the district for which the limited use was granted. If violated, the property would revert to the prior land use district classification.

  3.218 - Protection of natural features and resources.
General.
The provisions set forth herein are intended to protect the natural features and natural resources within Thomas County and to implement policies in the comprehensive plan. The natural features and natural resources as follows relate to floodplain, water resource protection boundaries, wetlands, river corridors, and soil and erosion control intended to be protected by the Ordinance related to:
Floodplain Damage Protection.
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its 100-year floodplain study, dated March 9, 1990 with accompanying maps and other supporting data are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this section and the Land Use Standards Ordinance.
(1)
It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety, and welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas.
(2)
General construction standards must be met when there is an encroachment beyond a special flood hazard boundary.
(3)
Thomas County Planning Department has information on supporting data for review of Federal Insurance Rate Maps and Thomas County's Flood Ordinance can be accessed on the website at Chapter 50, Article II, Floods.
Water Resource Protection Boundaries.
The intent of this section is to establish minimum development standards and regulations which will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout Thomas County. The findings of the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan has determined that the management of these resources is essential to the health, safety, welfare, and economic well being of the public, and to provide a guide for future growth and development in our County.
(A)
Three (3) water resource boundary protection areas are:
1.
Water sheds
2.
Wetlands
3.
River corridors
(B)
It is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured through management of land uses within Thomas County.
River Corridor Protection.
The following rivers have been designated as protected rivers by Thomas County and by the State of Georgia:
1.
Ochlocknee River
2.
Little Ochlocknee River
3.
Aucilla River
Purpose.
River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in Thomas County and the State of Georgia.
Protection required.
Shall comprise of all land, inclusive of islands in areas being within one hundred fifty (150) feet horizontally on both sides of the rivers as measured from the river banks.
Protection criteria:
The purpose of the river corridor criteria is to help maintain high water quality of the designated rivers by insuring that:
A.
A natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained within the river corridor at all times, except as provided for in the Ordinance. Construction within the buffer is prohibited.
B.
Uses and construction permitted in the corridor that creates no impairment or river functions.
C.
Complete criteria as stated in the Protected River Corridor Ordinance in the Thomas County Subdivision Ordinance.
D.
The standards and requirements in this section do not supersede those contained in the State River Protection Act and the Erosion and Sedimentation Act except that the one hundred fifty (150) foot buffer requirement exceeds the state standards.
E.
The River Corridor Ordinance shall require a one hundred fifty (150) foot buffer as allowed by the State of Georgia.
Wetlands Protection.
General.
A wetland is any sensitive and fragile natural resource with many development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. They provide a natural filtering of ground water for a higher quality of water, which migrates to our aquafers. These areas include the lands designated within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Wetlands Inventory Maps (N.W.I.) The N.W.I. are available at www.fws.gov/nwi. In addition, those areas included in the Thomas County Generalized Wetland areas depicted as wetland boundaries for a delineation of boundaries by the United States Army Corps of Engineer's as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. The landowner is, also, subject to federal or state permitting requirements.
Protection Criteria (local permit or permission):
(1)
No activity will be permitted within wetlands without a permit from Thomas County.
(2)
If development is located within twenty-five (25) feet of the wetland, a United States Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required.
(3)
If the United States Army Corps of Engineers determines wetlands are present, the local permit will not be granted until a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is granted.
(4)
The Wetland Protection Ordinance of Thomas County with its amendments can be accessed on the Thomas County web site Article IV Chapter 42 of the Environment Code. Generalized Wetland maps are located at the Thomas County Planning and Zoning Department.

NFI—Natural Features Inventory.
General.
A natural features inventory (NFI) is an inventory of all environmentally significant features on a parcel of land that is proposed for development or subdivision. Significant features include wetlands, water bodies, watercourses, floodplains, native forests, and habitats for endangered plants and animals.
I.
The requirement for a NFI inventory information can better ensure Thomas County and the developer in meeting local, state, and federal requirements for protecting various natural resources and features in Thomas County.
II.
An environmental permit application "form" shall be submitted for review of the specific finding to the Planning and Zoning Department by a qualified professional or biologist. This information and study is used to concentrate development activity away from sensitive areas as referenced in the above boundaries requiring protection. A natural features inventory is required as a part of any application for development or subdivision.
III.
Required applications for development or subdivisions:
a.
Short form—Is required on ten (10) or fewer acres. If significant natural features are identified within the property, a long form will be required.
b.
Long form—Is required for tracts larger than ten (10) acres as well as parcels of less than ten (10) acres if significant natural resources are found. The form will require a narrative of all natural features located within the site and a natural features overlay map identifying all significant areas requiring protection.
Natural features inventory forms are available at Thomas County Planning and Zoning Department. Completed forms may be submitted to the Thomas County Planning Director at regularly scheduled Technical Review Committee meetings. Thomas County staff will have fifteen (15) days to complete their review. At the end of the fifteen (15) day review period, the application will either receive approval, or the applicant will be notified if additional information is needed.

3.271.1 - Estate residential.
Amended by Ordinance of 05-24-2022 (1)
The purpose of this district is to provide an area for low density development of neighborhoods and subdivision development of exclusively residential land uses. The development area is concentrated to the north, northeast, and southwest of Thomasville. Significant development pressure in these areas is due to the availability of city water and some sewageable areas. New and infill development in the estate residential must be carefully regulated with design of streets, infrastructure, buffering, landscaping and connectivity of neighborhoods to create and maintain a sense of place.
Permitted uses within any estate residential area the following development uses may be permitted:

(A)
R-1 Residential , Single-family—Low density residential one (1) acre is intended to provide for single-family site built conventional detached residential dwellings on individual lots at a low density development consistent with the use of private community wells, DNR approved wells, and septic tanks or on-site waste water treatment facilities.
(B)
R-2 Residential , Single-family—Medium density residential one-half (½) of an acre, twenty-one thousand seven hundred eighty (21,780) square feet. This district is intended to provide for single site built conventional family dwellings on individual lots at a moderate density of development, consistent with the use of either community water systems or community sewage on-site disposal systems or both.
(C)
R-3 Residential , Single-family—This district is intended to provide for single-family manufactured home subdivision developments of low density or medium density.
Low density (one (1) acre) development shall be consistent with the use of private community wells, DNR approved wells, septic tanks or on-site wastewater treatment facilities.
Medium density (one-half (½) of an acre, twenty-one thousand seven hundred eighty (21,780) square feet) subdivision development shall be consistent with the use of either community water systems or community sewage disposal systems or both.
Manufactured homes, modular homes, and site built conventional single-family dwellings are permitted in a R-3 subdivision:
Manufactured homes shall be designed and installed to give the appearance of a single-family conventional dwelling. The appearance would ordinarily include:
•Permanent masonry foundation
•Pitched shingle roof
•Porches at exterior doors
•A floor space commensurate with adjacent dwellings located within the district
•Exterior appearance of wood, vinyl, masonry or fiber board siding
(D)
R-87 Low density —Subdivisions of single-family detached conventional built homes are intended to provide for residential development at a very low density that are expected to become more urban in character in future years. These areas involved are generally in transition from agriculture to residential and would be considered appropriate for low density residential development. The district is characterized by very low density of housing and large lots sizes as well as uses associated with rural agriculture areas. Large lots sizes are permissible. The low densities are permitted in this subdivision generally permits on-site septic systems and private wells.
(E)
Conservation subdivision developments —Thirty-five (35) acre minimum parcel size with development of fifty (50) percent of open space. (See design and development rules and regulations for conservation subdivision in the Thomas County Subdivision Ordinance.)
This type of development will maintain a rural atmosphere while allowing new residential development design as "conservation subdivision" that incorporates significant amounts of open space and protects the sensitive land areas. Architectual styles are encouraged so as to maintain the regional rural character of Thomas County. "Franchise" or "corporate" architecture should not be included.
Cluster design with smaller lot sizes are typical designs.
(F)
Single-family detached residential individual lots (one (1) unit/two (2) acres minimum.)
The single-family detached residential lot encourages low density development in the estate residential boundaries. The low densities permitted in this district generally permit onsite septic systems and private wells when public water and public sewer is not available.

3.271.2 - Suburban residential.
Amended by Ordinance of 05-24-2022 (1)
The purpose of this district boundary is to provide for both small attached and detached housing at a greater density than estate and rural residential neighborhoods in Thomas County. The areas designated as suburban residential are predominately neighborhoods situated between estate residential neighborhoods of Thomas County and the city limits of Thomasville.
The suburban "higher density" residential areas that are near the City of Thomasville water and sewer utilities to receive sewer and furnish related utilities. (Pressures for the typical types of suburban residential development are greater due to availability of sewer and water.) The "higher density" type development in sewerable areas will include a mixture of owner and rental occupied housing, and provide opportunities for innovative design.
A.
The following are appropriate types of developments that may be considered in the higher density Suburban Boundary and are subject to design standards and be located in a sewerable area:
(1)
Townhomes, duplexes, condominiums, and senior housing. (RM-11)
(2)
Apartments/rentals/duplexes. (RM-11)
(3)
Planned unit developments (PUD)—Type of development.
(4)
Conservation Subdivision—Type of development.
(5)
RM-11-Two (2)—eleven (11) units per acre (subject to design standards).
(6)
Mixed uses of small churches, public buildings, parks and limited neighborhood retail should be intergrated as "conditional land uses" in these predominately residential neighborhoods. All development is subject to subdivision rules and regulations, design and construction standards, and approval by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners.
B.
The boundary of the suburban district will allow many types of residential development and flexibility in terms of open space, convenient shopping, and recreational facilities.
The following uses are compatible in this predominately residential area:
(1)
Detached single-family—Two (2) acre/unit minimum subdivision. (R-87)
(2)
Detached single-family—One (1) acre/unit minimum subdivision. (R-1)
(3)
Detached single-family—One-half (½) of an acre unit minimum subdivision. (R-2)
(4)
Single-family manufactured home—One (1) acre unit minimum subdivision or one-half (½) acre unit minimum subdivision.
(5)
Single-family attached—Four (4) units per acre development. (R-4)
(6)
Conservation subdivision—Cluster development flexibility in terms of open space, fifty (50) percent green space. Subject to Conservation Ordinance design standards. (CSD)
(7)
Detached standard single-family—Individual lot—Two (2) acres minimum.
(8)
A master planned development/community with mixed uses blending residential development with schools, parks, open space, recreation, retail businesses, and services linked in a compact pattern that encourage walking and minimizes the need for auto trips within the subdivision. Compatible architectural styles are encouraged to maintain the regional character and should not include "franchise" or "corporate" architecture. (PUD)
(9)
Traditional neighborhood—Each new development should be a master planned community with mixed uses and flexibility of design standards relating to lesser setbacks, smaller lots, and amenities like sidewalks, street lamps, street trees, landscaping, and on street parking being provided. (TND)
(10)
Schools, colleges, and publicly owned and operated community structures.
(11)
Public utility structures and land.
(12)
Accessory uses of storage buildings must meet set backs, building height, location, and size requirements.
I.
Conditional uses.
Certain uses may be considered by the Thomas County PLUS Commission and Thomas County Board of Commissioners for conditional uses within the suburban residential district and the overall suburban boundary.
1.
Telecommunications towers and television towers.
2.
Privately operated preschool, kindergarten, day care nurseries, and care home facilities.
3.
Utilities, gas, electrical transmission, and pipe line distribution systems.
4.
Other uses after review by the Planning Staff, if found to be appropriate. See Section 4.300 "conditional uses" process of the Thomas County Land Use Standards Ordinance and permitted uses Table 4 of the Thomas County Land Use Ordinance.
II.
Tables.
Reference 3.271.2A. and B. of this section for the various "permitted uses" allowed in the suburban boundary and the suburban residential district. For density, area, yard, and height requirements reference Table 1.
The different "permitted uses" allowed are subject to water and sewer availability.
Private/public sewer and water systems will allow for higher density development of residential uses and the typical conventional subdivision.
Eleven (11) type developments are allowed in the predominately residential areas. Reference 3.271.2B. of this section.
Six (6) "higher density" type developments shall be allowed where the City of Thomasville is capable of providing water and sewer. These developments should be located near the Thomasville City Limit for utility services. (Reference 3.271.2(A) of this section.)
It is the intent of Thomas County to require new commercial developments to install appropriate improvements and comply with general design regulations intended to improve aesthetic appearance and functional enhancement.
The design regulations are intended to merge traffic engineering, civil engineering, urban design, landscape architecture, and land use planning principals into a set of regulations for commercial development.

3.271.7 - Planned developments.
Amended by Ordinance of 05-24-2022 (1)
•Conservation subdivision
•Planned district (commercial)-PD
•TND development
•PUD
The standards and requirements for all above planned developments provides for flexibility of design in order to promote efficient use of land and protect environmentally sensitive resources on the parcel.
These developments are alternatives to conventional subdivisions and may require specific procedures for application review, zoning, natural features inventory survey, open space, and infrastructure requirements for public water and public sewer.
The goal for Planned Developments shall be to maintain compatibility with nearby development and consistency with the future land use element of the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan by allowing the design of developments that are architecturally and environmentally innovative for efficient land use.
CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION
Purpose.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to provide flexibility in ensuring preservation of green space within a master-planned residential development. A conservation subdivision design preserves green space while maintaining the prorated density of residential units for the overall site area. Neutral density is achieved by allowing smaller individual owned residential lots in neighbor-hoods that include or are adjacent to aesthetically and ecologically important areas. The goal of the design process is to identify and set aside conservation areas prior to the delineation of transportation and residential pod layouts. Green space areas include wetlands, stream buffer zones, woodlands, playing fields, and meadows, depending on the resources of the land.
The purpose of conservation subdivision design is to:
A.
Encourage development that permanently conserves natural resources such as wetlands, floodplains, streams, groundwater; forests and steep slopes; scenic roads and scenic views; archaeological and historical resources, while still allowing density neutral residential development in urban-rural transition zones;
B.
Allow for greater flexibility and creativity in the design of residential developments;
C.
Encourage compact, efficient development practices that consume less land and provide for the efficient use of infrastructure;
D.
Encourage development practices that protect local topography by conforming the development to the landscape rather than the landscape to the development, thereby reducing land clearing costs and minimizing erosion and sedimentation;
E.
Provide for a greater range of development types in the community;
F.
Further community goals for protecting open space and greenways by means other than fee simple acquisition;
G.
Provide opportunities for compatible agricultural activities adjacent to residential uses; and
H.
Encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging the use of parks, open spaces, and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
Definitions —For the purpose of these regulations the following terms, whenever used in these regulations, shall have the meaning indicated for the Conservation Subdivisions:
(1)
Cluster development: A form of residential development that concentrates buildings or lots on a part of the site to allow the remaining land to be used for common open space, recreations, and preservation of environmentally sensitive features. The concentration of lots is facilitated by a reduction in lot size. A cluster development will consist of one (1) or more cluster groups surrounded by common open space.
(2)
Common facilities: All the real property and improvements set aside for the common use and enjoyment of the residents of a cluster development, including, but not limited to, buildings, open space, private streets, parking areas, walkways, recreation areas, drainage easements, and any utilities that service more than one (1) unit, such as sewerage and water supply facilities.
(3)
Conservation easement: The grant of a property right of interest from the property owner to another person, agency, unit of government, or organization stipulating that the described land shall remain in its natural, scenic, open, or wooded state, precluding future or additional development.
(4)
Deed restriction: A restriction on the use of a property set forth in the deed.
(5)
Density neutral: Density neutral means that the number of units allowed in a conservation subdivision design shall be equal to the number of units allowed using a conventional subdivision design.
(6)
Farmstead: A group of existing buildings with accessory structures used for agricultural purposes, such as barns, silos, and storage sheds.
(7)
Floodplains: Those lands, including the floodplain, flood fringe, floodway, and channel, subject to inundation by the 100-year recurrence interval flood or, where such data are not available, the maximum flood of record.
(8)
Homeowners' Association: An association combining individual home ownership with shared use, ownership, maintenance, and responsibility for common property or facilities, including private open space, within a cluster development.
(9)
Housing density determination: Process of determining the maximum number of units that can be developed in a conservation subdivision.
(10)
Nonprofit conservation organization: A nonprofit corporation, charitable trust, or other nonprofit organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which includes the "acquisition of property or rights in property for conservation purposes" as part of its mission, as reflected in the bylaws, charter, or incorporation papers of the organization.
(11)
Open space: Open space is the portion of the conservation subdivision that has been set aside for permanent protection. Activities within the open space are restricted in perpetuity through the use of an approved legal instrument.
(12)
Preliminary conceptual site plan: This plan shows the primary and secondary conservation features as well as the tentative location of houses, lots, and streets.
(13)
Site map: A map showing the locations of the primary and secondary conservation features as well as water features, soils, topography, vegetation, planned open space, and roads.
General regulations.
A.
Applicability of regulations. In order to achieve these purposes, the conservation subdivision design is available as a use by right in the following district boundaries:
1.
Ag district.
2.
Ag conservation.
3.
Rural residential.
4.
Estate residential.
5.
Suburban residential.
(1)
Conservation subdivisions are most appropriate near urban-rural transitional areas where densities are lower.
(2)
The following classifications of a minor or major conservation subdivisions relate to the minimum acres required for development in the following district boundaries:
EXPAND
District/Boundary Minimum Acres Class
Ag District 35 acres Major
Ag Conservation 35 acres Major
Rural Residential 35 acres Major
Estate Residential 20 acres Minor
Suburban Residential 20 acres Minor
  (3)
Conservation subdivision in Ag districts. The Ag-Agricultural zoning district permits a wide array of uses, some of which may conflict with the enjoyment of one's property as a residential use. The Board of Commissioners may approve a site plan for a conservation subdivision on property zoned Ag upon finding the proposed subdivision is compatible or may be consistent with development surrounding the proposed subdivision. The regulations in this chapter shall be applicable upon approval of the site plan by the Board of Commissioners.
(4)
Off-lot individually-owned septic facilities. When permitted by the Health Department, components of an individually-owned wastewater treatment facility may be located on suitable soil in the open space when such land is secured by easement. Land under easement in the open space used for this purpose may be included by applicant toward meeting minimum lot size requirements of the Health Department; and the total land area of the house lot and off-lot easement must equal or exceed the minimum lot size specified by the Health Department. The easement shall be fully described on the subdivision plat, and clearly marked by iron pins or signs placed by a registered surveyor from commencement of construction until occupancy of the corresponding house.
Public maintenance of community or individually-owned off-lot wastewater facilities.
With permission of the Health Department, Planning Director, and Public Works Director, easements may be accepted for maintenance of community waste water facilities or individually owned off-lot waste water treatment facilities.
B.
Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be designed as a conservation subdivision may be held in single and separate ownership or in a multiple ownership. However when a tract is held in multiple ownership, it shall be planned as a single entity, and developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
1.
Phased development: Unless approved under a concept/preliminary plan as outlined herein, each phase of a conservation subdivision must meet the density criteria established herein.
2.
Proof of ownership: The developer of a conservation subdivision must provide documentation of ownership of all land to be planned as a conservation subdivision prior to approval of a land disturbance permit for the development. The only lands that may be considered for development as a conservation subdivision are those lands owned by the applicant for the land disturbance permit.
C.
Site suitability. As evidenced by the existing resources or NFI survey, the conservation subdivision concept/preliminary plan, and the final plat, the tract incorporating the conservation subdivision design shall be suitable for supporting development in terms of environmental conditions, its size and its configuration.
D.
Sensitive area disturbance. The proposed design shall strictly minimize disturbance of environmentally sensitive areas, as shown on the NFI survey. Lands within the 100-year floodplain, designated as wetlands, having slopes in excess of twenty-five (25) percent, and riparian buffers adjacent to streams constitute such environmentally sensitive area, where disturbance shall be strictly minimized. Demonstration by the applicant that these features shall be protected by the proposed application shall be prerequisite to approval of the conservation subdivision concept/preliminary plan and subsequent final plat.
E.
Minor and major subdivisions number of lots. Minor subdivisions, defined in the Thomas County Development Ordinance as "a subdivision of land which results in the creation of two (2) or more lots and does not result in the creation of any public or private streets", are not eligible to be developed under the conservation regulations contained herein. Only those subdivisions, creating eight (8) or more lots are permissible to be developed as a conservation subdivision.
F.
Effect of concept/preliminary plan. The approved concept/preliminary plan shall bind all land within the plan to the requirements and conditions of the conservation subdivision regulations. Should the developer or land owner subsequently sell or otherwise transfer their interest in the property, all heirs and assigns shall be bound to the approved concept/preliminary plan, unless amended by and/or approved by the Board of Commissioners.
1.
Deed restriction required: Upon approval of the concept/preliminary plan for the entire property being developed as a conservation subdivision, the applicant shall present a covenant to be recorded with the deed for all property within the concept/preliminary plan. Such covenant shall bind all land within the concept/preliminary plan to said plan and shall not expire unless or until such plan is amended and approved by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners.
Use regulations.
Land planned as a conservation subdivision may be used for the following purposes:
A.
Single-family detached dwellings;
B.
Conservation areas as specified herein;
C.
The following nonresidential use in accordance with standards specified in this article [section]:

**Subject to DNR water system and onsite waste water treatment system or septic tanks in the common areas.
Minimum lot size: Clustering of home on lots that are smaller than conventional development is the key to conserving the natural features and creating open space.
Housing density determination. The maximum number of lots in a conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two (2) methods, at the discretion of the applicant:
A.
Calculation method: The maximum number of lots is determined by multiplying the net tract acreage by the maximum density units/acre factor (see Table 1) specified in the underlying zoning. The net tract acreage is calculated as outlined below:
Step 1.
Calculation of the constrained lands:
Total area of land in items a.—d. below multiplied by one-half (½).
a.
Slopes over twenty-five (25) percent of at least five thousand (5,000) square feet contiguous area.
b.
The 100-year floodplain.
c.
Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act.
d.
Area of land in stream buffers as required by federal, state or local regulations.
Total area of land in items e. and f. below:
e.
Area of land designated for construction of roads and associated ROW.
f.
Area of all impervious surfaces associated with amenities, including but not limited to parking areas, tennis courts, swimming pools, clubhouses and other constrained Lands = (total area of land in items a.—d. times one-half (½) + total area of land in items e. and f.
Step 2.
Net tract acreage. Once the area of constrained lands has been calculated, the net tract acreage is calculated by subtracting the acreage of constrained lands from the gross tract acreage of the property to be development as a conservation subdivision.
B.
Yield plan method: The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all local, state and federal applicable regulations. Such yield plan shall be reviewed by the appropriate County staff to verify such plan meets the minimum criteria for development as proposed.
Where the number of lots allowed under the yield plan method results in more lots than the number of lots under the calculation method, the lot size may be reduced by fifty (50) percent of the permissible lot size in Table 1 to accommodate the difference in the number of lots between the two (2) methods. Where on-site sewage management systems are to be used, the size of the lots shall be no less than that required by the Health Department.
Area and Yard Requirements; Locations and Structures.
Placement. The placement of all principal buildings shall provide for safe, quiet, and harmonious grouping as well as adequate privacy by providing adequate front, side, and rear yards.
Location. Structures shall be placed so as to fulfill the objectives of, purposes of this ordinance, and to minimize any adverse effect on the environment and to take advantage of ecological conditions.

Value of secondary conservation areas. Secondary conservation areas are those areas within a property which contain other intrinsic qualities of value to the community. Also, secondary conservation areas are valued as supplemental area to the total conservation area of a conservation subdivision. To that end, Thomas County would prefer secondary conservation areas to be protected to the maximum extent possible after all identified primary conservation areas have been protected.
Conservation areas, general recommendations.
A.
Conservation areas should include the most sensitive resource areas of a property.
B.
Fragmentation of conservation land should be minimized so that resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development.
C.
Conservation areas should be designed as a part of larger continuous and integrated green space.
D.
The conservation areas (primary and secondary) shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within the subdivision. Nonadjoining lots shall be provided with safe, convenient access to the conservation areas.
Permitted uses of green space. Uses of green space may include the following:

All fees associated with the recordation of plats and legal instruments will be furnished by the developer of the conservation subdivision or their agent.
Procedure.
Pre-application meeting (first meeting).
A pre-application meeting is required between the applicant, the site designer and the Planning Staff where the site designer has not submitted a conservation subdivision designed under these regulations prior to the effective date. Subsequent pre-application meetings are recommended but are at the discretion of the site designer. The purpose of the pre-application meeting is to introduce the applicant to the County's zoning, subdivision regulations, and procedures; to discuss the applicant's objectives and to schedule site inspections; set up additional meetings, and plan submissions. Applicants are encouraged to present the NFI survey at this meeting.
Existing resources Natural Features Inventory (second meeting).
The purpose of this key submission is to familiarize County Staff and Officials with existing and factual reference in making a site inspection. This plan shall be provided prior to the site inspection and shall form the basis for the development design as shown on the conceptual preliminary plan. The applicant shall present the Natural Features Inventory survey, which is to ensure that the important site features have been adequately identified prior to the creation of the site design, and that the proposed green space will meet the requirements of this article.
The existing NFI survey forms shall include the following features: (The NFI short or long forms are available at the Planning Department.)
•Property boundaries.
•All streams (perennial and intermittent), rivers, lakes, wetlands and other hydrologic features.
•Topographic contours of no less than ten-foot intervals.
•All primary and secondary conservation areas labeled by type, as described in this article [section].
•Vegetation characteristics.
•Groundwater recharge areas.
•Significant wildlife habitats, if known.
•Historic, archeological and cultural features.
•General soil types.
•The planned location of protected green space.
•Existing roads and structures.
•Potential connections with existing green space and trails.
•Identification of surrounding property type/land use.
Review of existing resources. The existing resources map shall be reviewed by the Planning Director or his/her designee. If found inadequate by the reviewer, the reviewer shall state the reasons for its inadequacy, and the existing resources map shall not be accepted until adequate changes are made.
Site inspection (third meeting).
After preparing the existing resources survey or NFI, applicants may arrange for a site inspection of the property by the Planning Staff and shall distribute copies of such site analysis plan at this on-site meeting. The purpose of the site visit is to familiarize the staff with the property's existing conditions and special features, to identify potential site design issues, and to provide an informal opportunity to discuss site design concepts, including the general layout of the designated green space lands and potential locations for proposed buildings and street alignments. Comments made by the staff and consultants shall be interpreted as being only suggestive. It shall be understood by all parties that no formal recommendations can be offered, and no official decisions can be made at the site inspection.
Sketch plan submission (may be submitted at site inspection meeting).
Purpose. At the discretion of the applicant, a sketch plan may be submitted as a diagrammatic basis for informal discussion with the staff regarding the design of a proposed subdivision or land development. The purpose of a sketch plan submission is to provide a mechanism to help applicants and the staff develop a better understanding of the property and to help establish an overall design approach that respects its special or noteworthy features while providing for the density permitted under the Zoning Ordinance.
Required information. To provide a full understanding of the site's potential and to facilitate the most effective exchange with the Planning Staff, the sketch plan shall include the information listed below. Many of these items can be taken from the NFI survey and in fact the diagrammatic sketch plan may be prepared as a simple overlay sheet placed on top of a tax map or aerial map.
1.
Name and address of the legal owner, the equitable owner, and/or the applicant;
2.
Name and address of the professional engineer, surveyor, planner, architect, landscape architect, or the site designer responsible for preparing the plan;
3.
Graphic scale (not greater than one (1) inch = two hundred (200) feet, however, dimensions on plan need not be exact) and north arrow;
4.
Approximate tract boundaries, sufficient to locate the tract on a map of the community;
5.
Location map;
6.
Zoning district;
7.
Streets on and adjacent to the tract (both existing and proposed);
8.
One hundred-year floodplain limits, and approximate location of wetlands, if any;
9.
Topographic, physical and cultural features including fields, pastures, meadows, wooded areas, trees with a diameter of fourteen (14) inches or more, hedgerows and other significant vegetation, steep slopes (greater than twenty-five (25) percent), soil types, ponds, ditches, drains, dumps, storage tanks, streams within two hundred (200) feet of tract, existing right-of-way and easements, and cultural features such as all structures, foundations, walls, wells, trails, and abandoned roads;
10.
Schematic layout indicating a general concept for land conservation and development.
11.
Proposed general street and lot layout;
12.
In the case of land development plans, proposed location of buildings and major structures, parking areas and other improvements; and
13.
General description of proposed method of water supply, sewage disposal, and stormwater management.
Concept/preliminary plan (fourth meeting).
The concept/preliminary plan shall follow the process and procedure outlined in the Thomas County Subdivision Rules and Regulations for plan submittal. The plan shall be reviewed by staff at regular scheduled Technical Review Committee meetings.
Four-step subdivision design process.
All concept/preliminary plans for conservation subdivisions shall include documentation of a four step design process in determining the layout of proposed green space lands, house sites, streets and lot lines as described below.
A.
Step 1: Delineation of green space lands.
1.
The minimum percentage and acreage of required green space lands shall be calculated by the applicant and submitted as part of the sketch plan or conceptual design plan in accordance with this ordinance. Green space lands shall include all primary conservation areas and those parts of the secondary conservation areas to meet the terms of this ordinance.
2.
Proposed green space lands shall be designated using the engineer's calculations as a base map.
3.
In delineating secondary conservation areas, the applicant shall consult with the Planning Staff on the prioritization of natural and cultural resources on the tract in terms of their highest to least suitability for inclusion in the proposed green space.
4.
On the basis of those priorities and practical considerations given to the tract's configuration, its context in relation to resource areas on adjoining and neighboring properties, and the applicants subdivision objectives, secondary conservation areas shall be delineated to meet at least the minimum area percentage requirements for green space lands and in a manner clearly indicating their boundaries as well as the types of resources included within them.
B.
Step 2: Location of house sites.
Potential house sites shall be tentatively located using the proposed green space lands as a base map as well as other relevant data on the resource maps such as topography and soils. Home sites should generally be located not closer than one hundred (100) feet from primary conservation areas and fifty (50) feet from secondary conservation areas, taking into consideration the potential negative impacts of residential development on such areas as well as the potential positive benefits of such locations to provide attractive views and visual settings for residences.
C.
Step 3: Alignment of streets and trails.
Upon designating the house sites, a street plan shall be designed to provide vehicular access to each house, which complies with the standards for road design in the Thomas County Subdivision Regulations and bears a logical relationship to topographic conditions. Impacts of the street plan on proposed green space lands shall be minimized, particularly with respect to crossing environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands and traversing steep slopes. Street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number of new cul-de-sacs and to facilitate access to and from homes in different parts of the tract and adjoining parcels.
D.
Step 4: Drawing in the lot lines.
Upon completion of the preceding three (3) steps, lot lines are drawn as required to delineate the boundaries of individual residential lots. Lot lines are drawn as the last step.
E.
Additional design considerations:
1.
Additional minimum acreage requirements for green space areas consist of secondary conservation areas.
2.
Total green space area requirements are the sum of primary and secondary conservation areas.
3.
The locations and boundaries of primary conservation.
4.
The locations and boundaries of secondary conservation.
5.
Development areas constitute the remaining lands of the tract outside the designated green space areas.
Road specification.
Roads for the conservation subdivision shall follow road construction guidelines consistent with those set forth in the Thomas County Subdivision Regulations. The design of streets within the conservation subdivision, and where possible and with the approval of the County Public Works Director, should seek to:
1.
Minimize the number of cul-de-sac streets by providing more than one (1) entrance to the development and interconnect streets as much as possible.
2.
For cul-de-sac streets, minimize the amount of impervious surface by limiting the internal turning radius to thirty-five (35) feet and the width of the paved lane to twenty (20) feet. Use grass and vegetation for the inner circle of turn-a-rounds, rather than paving the entire area. Declare the HOA responsible for the maintenance of the grassy area in the neighborhood bylaws.
3.
Omit curbs wherever appropriate.
4.
As an alternative to curbs and gutters, allow runoff from roofs and pavements to pass immediately through grass swales or infiltration basins. Use plant material that will absorb rainwater and act as a natural filter for oil and pollution.
5.
Provide paths for nonvehicular traffic within the development and connecting to neighboring residential recreation areas.
Buffer requirement.
Where property to be developed as a conservation subdivision abuts property not a part of the conservation subdivision, the conservation subdivision shall have a buffer along the exterior property boundary. The buffer shall be undisturbed except as specifically allowed herein, and of sufficient volume to provide a year-round opaque screening. Where no vegetation exists within the required buffer area, or where existing semi vegetation does not provide a sufficient screen, and where planting of native vegetation will provide screening, the buffer shall be planted with such vegetation to meet the intent of this section.
A.
Mandatory stormwater structures. Where the only practical place upon the tract of land being developed as a conservation subdivision to locate a stormwater facility serving to contain and control the stormwater generated from the conservation subdivision is within the required buffer. The County Public Works Director may permit such a structure to be built within the required buffer. The area devoted to the installation of the stormwater structure may not be used to satisfy the green space requirement for the development.
Where stormwater structures are allowed within the buffer, the developer shall plant sufficient vegetative material to effectively screen the location of such structure and obscure such structure from view.
B.
Trails. Where trails are planned to be provided, such trails may be constructed within the buffer area. The path through the buffer area containing such trail may be no wider than eight (8) feet. All clearing associated with the construction of such path shall be contained within the eight (8) feet. If such trails are planned as a part of the development, the trails must be located within the first twenty-five (25) percent of the buffer furthest from the exterior boundary line for the subdivision but in no event shall be within thirty (30) feet of said exterior boundary line.
Size of buffer. The size of the exterior buffer is determined by the size of the lot proposed adjacent to the exterior boundary for the conservation subdivision. (See Table 3, Minimum Exterior Boundary Buffer.)
Buffer counts toward green space requirement. The area of land designated to the exterior boundary buffer may be used to satisfy the minimum required green space for the development. The buffer area shall not be included as a part of any platted residential lot within the subdivision. This buffer shall be considered a secondary conservation area unless a feature of the buffer qualifies as primary conservation area as defined herein. Such buffer shall be designated as part of the green space for the subdivision and be permanently protected in accordance with the requirements contained herein.

  Planned Unit Development (PUD)
A.
Purpose.
The intent and purpose of the planned unit development (PUD) is to encourage creative and imaginative design for the development of residential and nonresidential areas that include compatible residential, commercial, office and related public facilities and provides a higher level of urban amenities. A PUD may be approved according to a site plan that ensures the more efficient use of land conservation of natural environment and efficient streets and utilities.
This district is to be utilized as a floating zone which shall mean that areas will not be pre-designated as planned unit development districts, but rather each such designation shall result from a specific and separate application for amendment. Planned unit development districts are separate zoning districts and shall follow the same amendment procedure as other zoning districts. The development standards and land uses, if approved, shall become the standards for the property related to the zoning regulations. For purposes of zoning compliance, a PUD district property shall be treated as one (1) lot or parcel.
B.
Objectives:
The planned unit development district must provide the following, as appropriate:
(1)
Mixture of uses: Accommodate a mixture of land uses which are compatible both internally and externally on the parcel.
(2)
Ensure the conservation of natural resources, geological, and topographical features with emphasis upon:
(a)
Conservation of existing surface and sub-surface water resources.
(b)
Prevention of soil erosion on the property.
(c)
Preserve large trees and natural vegetated areas.
(d)
Efficient land use in design of streets and utilities within the PUD district and adequate utilities including public water, public sanitary sewer systems and stormwater facilities.
(e)
Developing open space for recreation or wildlife.
(3)
A preliminary development plan to convey the overall concept and to guide and coordinate any phased development and a final development plan which meets all of the pre-approved regulations.
(4)
The PUD developments may be located only within the suburban residential boundaries and have access to minor arterial or minor collector roads or streets.
C.
Type of planned unit development and permitted uses:
The following types of planned unit developments are authorized by these regulations:
(1)
a.
Residential uses only (single-family except manufactured homes).
b.
Residential with other uses (mixed).
Other uses: Public buildings, including churches and other places of worship, and recreation facilities for use of the residents of the PUD [and also their guests]. The restrictions as to the use of these facilities shall be set forth in covenants for the residential district.
The following minimum requirements shall be required:
Adequate public water and public sewer service or facilities shall be required for all development in a PUD.
Minimum land area for development is fifteen (15) acres.
Residential: (Sixty-five (65) percent).
Open space: (Fifteen (15) percent).
Recreation, civic or public buildings: (Twenty (20) percent).
The following uses may be permitted within a PUD district if in conformance with specific and precise preliminary and final development plans or phases as set forth in this ordinance:
1.
Residential uses: Residences may be a variety of housing types and ownership types as follows: single-family detached, attached single-family, duplex (two-family), multifamily, townhouse, patio homes, zero (0) lot line design homes, condominiums, and apartments.

2.
Community center, meeting facilities, indoor or outdoor recreation facilities and spaces are permitted when limited to use by the residents of the PUD through recorded covenants and restrictions.
3.
Commercial and office uses:
Office uses shall include those permitted in the commercial limited districts. Office development shall be designed with respect to intensity, location and use so as to primarily serve the residents of the PUD. All business or office uses shall be landscaped and buffered from residential uses. Office uses would be considered an office park development in the PUD.
Commercial uses shall include those uses allowed in "planned shopping centers" and "planned service centers". Such uses shall be designed with respect to their nature, development intensity and location so as to primarily serve the residents of the PUD.
Commercial development shall be landscaped and meet buffer requirements in a manner to screen the commercial development from residential development in the PUD. All interior streets or roads in this district shall be curb and gutter.
The development design for streets and roads shall not route through residential areas within or adjacent to the PUD parcel.
4.
Public uses.
Other uses such as public buildings, civic use, churches and recreation facilities are permitted.
These developments shall be centrally located within the PUD to ensure adequate areas by residents and users.
Pedestrian and bicycle paths shall be provided to connect civic and public uses to residential areas.
Adequate public water and public sewer service or facilities shall be required for all development in a PUD.
The minimum acreage for a mixed PUD of residential, commercial/office uses (office park) or planned shopping center shall be twenty-five (25) acres.

(1)
General: To develop a PUD within the County, the property must be rezoned to a PUD designation. Rezoning shall be subject to approval of the preliminary development plan by the County Commission. No building permits shall be issued until the final development plan for the particular development phase has been approved by the County Commission and fully recorded.
(2)
Unified ownership: An application for approval of a PUD may be filed by any person having an interest in the property to be included in the PUD. The PUD application shall be filed with written consent from all of the recorded owner(s) of the property included in the development and with written consent from all holder(s) of an equitable interest in such property. Such consent shall contain a statement that the applicant is authorized to represent the owner(s) in pursuit of a PUD application and that such owner(s) shall agree to be bound by the decision of the County Commission in the event such application is approved. All of the land in a PUD shall be owned by an individual, by a corporation, or by a single legal entity before approval of the final development plan. The owner shall be required to provide evidence of full ownership interest in the land, by legal title or the execution of a binding sales agreement before final approval of the final development plan. Individual properties may be sold after approval of the final development plan subject to private deed covenants that assure the continuance of the PUD as originally approved and developed.
(3)
Pre-application meeting in the technical review meeting: Before submitting the preliminary development plan application for approval as a PUD, the developer shall meet with the Planning Director, Health Department Official, Public Works Director and any other such personnel as may be deemed necessary to determine the feasibility and suitability of the application. This step is required so that the developer may obtain information and guidance from County officials before entering into any binding commitments or incurring substantial expenses of the site and plan preparation.
(4)
A completed natural features inventory assessment of the property must be prepared.

In the event that any uncertainty exists with respect to the intended boundaries of the various Land Use Standards Districts as shown on the Official Land Use Standards Atlas, the Board of Commissioners shall make the interpretation using the following rules:
(1)
The land use standards district boundaries are the center lines of the streets, alleys, waterways, and rights-of-way, unless otherwise indicated. Wherever designation of a boundary line on the zoning atlas coincides with the location of a street, alley, waterway, or right-of-way, it shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
(2)
Where the land use standards district boundaries do not coincide with the location of streets, alleys, waterways, and rights-of-way, but do coincide with lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
(3)
Where the land use standards district boundaries do not coincide with the location of streets, alleys, waterways, and rights-of-way or lot lines, the land use standards district boundary shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Land Use Standards Atlas.
