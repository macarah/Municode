Section 84. - Buffer and Landscape Standards for Gateway Overlay Zoning District.
This section enacts a new article to provide guidance in the management of development along the major highways entering the City of Gray, which are U.S. Route 129, Georgia Route 22, Georgia Route 11, and Georgia Route 18; and shall apply to all properties bordering these highway corridors. These are the major highways through the City of Gray, which are traveled daily by many people and are home to numerous businesses and residents, thus making these highway corridors the major gateways to the City of Gray with much value to the community, both economically and aesthetically.
The purpose of this section is to set standards for development of property fronting these highway corridors, including the establishment of buffers and the preservation and establishment of landscaping and trees as a part of all land disturbing activities in order to safeguard the ecological and aesthetic environment necessary for the health, safety, and welfare of the public, to enhance and protect property values, and to make the City of Gray a more attractive place to live, visit, and conduct business.
Buffer areas visibly separate one use from another through screening and distance; shield and block noise, light, glare or visual or other conditions; block physical passage to non-similar areas; and reduce air pollution, dust, dirt, and litter.
Trees, woodland areas, and landscape strips act as buffers against noise, wind and sun; filter out pollutants; assist in stabilizing the soil; reduce erosion and storm water runoff; improve water quality; enhance wildlife; and increase the aesthetic, social, and property value of the community.
Thus, the mayor and city council of the City of Gray hereby finds that requirements for buffers, the planting of new trees and other landscape material, the protection and preservation of trees as part of the land development process along the Gateway Highways U.S. Route 129, Georgia Route 22, Georgia Route 11, and Georgia Route 18, are public purposes and provide for the public health and general welfare.
Regulations of the Gateway Overlay Zoning District are as follows:
84.1. Applicability. Any lot within 500 feet of a gateway highway shall be included in the gateway overlay. If any portion of a lot is affected by the overlay than the entire lot shall conform to section 84.

84.11. Tree protection.
a.
Planning considerations. Tree space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the development process. The root systems of trees do extend beyond the drip line of the canopy. The root system within the drip line region is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Disturbance within this root zone will directly affect a tree's chances for survival. To protect these trees critical root zones the following standards shall apply:
1.
The use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged. This will facilitate ease in overall site organization as related to tree protection.
2.
Tree protection zones for stands or single trees should include an area no less than the total area beneath the tree(s) canopy as defined by the farthest canopy drip line of that tree(s).
3.
Layout of the project site utility and grading plans should accommodate the required tree protective zones. Utilities must be placed along corridors between protective zones.
4.
Construction site activities such as parking, materials storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protection zones.
5.
No disturbances shall occur within the protective zone of stands of trees during construction.
b.
Protective barriers. Protective tree barriers shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely surrounding the critical root zones of all designated tree protective zones prior to any land disturbances.
1.
These barriers will be a minimum of four feet high constructed in a post and rail configuration. Four foot orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing is also acceptable.
2.
Passive forms of tree protection may be utilized to delineate tree save areas which are remote from areas of land disturbance. These areas must be completely surrounded with continuous rope or flagging.
3.
All tree protection zones should be designated as such with "tree save area" sign posted visibly on all sides of the fenced area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are highly recommended for site entrances.
4.
All designated tree protection zones must be protected from the sedimentation of erosion material. Type A, B or C Silt screening as defined in the Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Georgia shall be installed when necessary along the outer uphill edge of the tree protection zone at the land disturbance interface, and shall remain in place throughout the construction and landscape installation process.
c.
Encroachment. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. If encroachment is anticipated within the critical root zones of designated tree protective zones the following preventive measures shall be employed.
1.

2.
The installation of utilities through a protective zone shall occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching. If roots must be cut, proper root pruning procedures must be employed.
3.
No fill shall be allowed within the drip line.
4.
Where the zoning officer has determined that irreparable damage has occurred to trees within the tree protective zones, the trees must be removed and replaced.
d.
Landmark and historic trees. The Georgia Landmark & Historical Tree Register was established in 1994 by the Georgia Urban Forest Council. The register serves as a record of all the significant trees across the state.
Landmark and historic trees are those individual trees or groups of trees that have been designated as significant on the basis of their importance in national state or local history. They possess integrity of location, setting, design, progeny, and represent events, heritage, feeling and association.
Inclusion of a tree or group of trees on the register is used for the protection and preservation of the tree(s). Any tree or group of trees which is included on the Georgia Landmark & Historical Tree Register is prohibited from being damaged and may be removed only with prior zoning department approval. If a historic and/or landmark tree is damaged or removed without prior approval the department of planning and zoning will impose a fine equal to $1,000.00 per inch DBH of the damaged or removed tree(s).

Section 85. - Water Resource Protection Overlay Districts.
85.1. Purpose.
The intent of this section is to establish minimum development standards and criteria which will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout the City of Gray. It has been determined the wise management of these resources as defined in this section is essential to maintaining the health, safety, general welfare and economic well being of the public.
85.2. Establishment of Water Resource Overlay Districts.
The City of Gray's Water Resource Overlay Districts shall include the following:
Groundwater Recharge Area Overlay District
Wetlands Protection Overlay District
The boundaries of these Water Resource Overlay Districts are shown on a set of maps designated as "Water Resource Overlay Districts" and are included as part of the City of Gray's Official Zoning Map, which is on file in the zoning enforcement officer's office located in the Jones County Government Center.
85.3. Definitions.
In addition to the general definitions provided in this section, the following definitions shall apply to this section:
a.
Aquifer. Any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
b.
Drastic. The standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Document EPA-600-87-035 (Note: The drastic methodology is most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility).
c.
Generalized wetlands map. The current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for the City of Gray, Georgia.
d.
Jurisdictional wetland. An area that needs the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
e.
Jurisdictional wetland determination. A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33. U.S.C. § 1344, as amended.
f.
Pollution susceptibility. The relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area.
g.
Pollution susceptibility map. The relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources using the drastic methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia.)
h.
Recharge area. Any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
i.
Regulated activity. Any activity which will or which may reasonably be expected to result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
j.
Significant recharge areas. Those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition).
k.
Water resource districts. A water resource district is a map overlay which imposes a set of requirements in addition to those of the underlying zoning district.
l.
Wetlands. Those areas inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation and hydrological conditions involving a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.
85.4. Groundwater Recharge Area Overlay District.
85.4.1. Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides, sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
85.4.2. Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.
85.4.3. District delineation. The Groundwater Recharge Area Overlay District is delineated according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition)." Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the "Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 Edition." Said maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance.
85.4.4. Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Overlay District. The following are additional requirements for specific uses:
a.
New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt provided they comply with all federal requirements.
b.
New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within:
1.
A high pollution susceptibility area;
2.
A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet in size; and
3.
A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet in size.
As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 × 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the National Resource and Conservation Service.
c.

Notes to tables
Section A. The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (3 or 4 bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed for construction or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the Jones County Board of Health will require larger lots to assure usable soil area.
Section B. The Jones County Board of Health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features.
Section C. Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively.
Section D. The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors.
Section E. There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent city zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met.
Section F. The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine the square footage of the lot needed, X, use the following formula:
EXPAND
X = 5,000 gal/day
1,200 gal/acre/day
  = 4.17 acres
= 4.17 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre
= 181,500 ft 2 area of land needed.
Likewise, for a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine the square footage of the lot needed, Y, for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula:
EXPAND
Y = 5,000 gal/day
600 gal/acre/day>
  = 8.33 acres
= 8.33 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre
= 363,000 ft 2 area of land needed.
85.5. Wetlands Protection Overlay District.
85.5.1. Findings of fact. The wetlands within the City of Gray are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constrains due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study, and recreational opportunities.
85.5.2. Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas.
85.5.3. District delineation. The Wetlands Protection Overlay District is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Gray, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this section, together with all explanatory matter thereon as attached thereto.
The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City of Gray and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this Ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
85.5.4. Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use except those identified shall be allowed within the Wetland Overlay District without a development permit from the City of Gray. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a Wetlands Protection District boundary as determined by the zoning enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until Section 404 Permit or letter of permission is issued.
85.5.5. Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right within the Wetland Protection Overlay District to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, exempted from Section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 Permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.) draining or dredging as provided herein. (These activities listed in this section are:
1.
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
2.
Conservation or preservation soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the State of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
3.
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
4.
The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
5.
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed, and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed.
6.
Education, scientific research and nature trails.
85.5.6. Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in a Wetland Overlay District:
1.
Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants.
2.
Hazardous or sanitary landfills.
Section 86. - HD Historic Overlay Zoning District.
The purpose of this district is to protect areas deemed to possess special historical, cultural, and aesthetic features. Whenever a property or area is designated historic, the HD Historic Overlay Zoning District designation shall be placed upon that specific property or area, in addition to the applicable zoning district designation. The requirements contained herein are in addition to requirements applicable to that underlying zoning district.
86.1. Certificate of appropriateness required. Where a Certificate of Appropriateness is required by the City of Gray Historic Preservation Commission Ordinance for construction, structural alteration, or use of land in an HD District, no person shall undertake that construction, structural alteration; or use without having first obtained a Certificate of Appropriateness.
86.2. Affect on zoning permit process. A Zoning Compliance Permit or Conditional Use Permit shall not be issued for any construction, structural alteration, or use of land in an HD District for which a certificate of appropriateness is required and has not been issued. An application for a conditional use may be considered and approved contingent upon issuance of a certificate of appropriateness.
86.3. Annexed property. Whenever property proposed to be annexed into the City of Gray is designated as being in a Jones County HD Historic Overlay Zoning District, the applicant shall be required to request said property be included in the City of Gray HD Historic Overlay Zoning District.

Section 87. - Design overlay districts.
87.1. Purpose and intent. The Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) and Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO) have been implemented to help create a sense of place for the City of Gray that will help to protect and enhance the downtown area. The development in the DDO district affects Gray's small town character, its traditional development pattern, and its cultural heritage and tourism economy.
Often, conventional development patterns produce linear development, asphalt wastelands, harsh and glaring light levels, and a proliferation of billboards and other distracting signage and visual clutter. Inadequately planned and regulated strip development has also spawned traffic congestion, competing signage and incompatible architecture. The primary goal of the overlay zoning ordinance and the Design Guideline Manual is to protect and improve the character of these gateways and corridors while directing future development that promotes safety, walkability, visual attractiveness and directional wayfinding in a manner that compliments Gray's ambiance and historic character and orientation.
87.2. Objectives. The properties within the Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) are primarily one-story commercial buildings, with one and two-story residential homes primarily located around the perimeter of the district. The properties within the Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO) are primarily one-story commercial buildings. The overall purpose and intent of both districts is to permit the development of land in a manner consistent with a traditional, pedestrian-oriented, small town feel. The regulations for both the Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) and Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO) are intended to implement the following objectives:
87.2.1. Promote redevelopment. To provide for and promote the rehabilitation, revitalization and redevelopment of vacant and underutilized properties in the districts.
87.2.2. Promote development of vacant parcels, in keeping with the vision of the corridor. To provide for and promote the development of vacant properties within the districts in a manner and style consistent with the regulations set forth in the City of Gray Design Guideline Manual
87.2.3. Improve streetscapes. To implement various recommendations in plan, programs, studies, and strategies of the city, for aesthetic improvement of the overlay districts. In order to improve the streetscape, additional provisions for private property improvements are required.
87.2.4. Promote specific designs. To encourage development and redevelopment to occur in a manner consistent with the community's expectations for superior design and development characteristics that promote quality of place. Such expectations include:
•
Human-scale development and pedestrian-friendly places, including generally the principles of neo-traditional development.
•
Development that is sensitive to and that extends design principles characteristic of the city's historic characteristics.
•
New non-residential development using design principles consistent with the late 19th and early 20th century architectural style, in order to recreate the original small town feel of the commercial business district by using "commercial block" patterns with common sidewalls, building fronts abutting the sidewalk and on-street parking.
•
Breaking up "super-blocks" (large parcel development patterns) and optimizing connectivity.
•
Installing small public gathering places and pocket parks in redeveloped areas.
•
Ensuring quality construction that will avoid construction of buildings with limited life spans.
87.3. Establishment of districts. The following overlay zoning districts are hereby established:
EXPAND
District Name Abbreviation
Downtown Design Overlay District DDO
Corridor Design Overlay District CDO
  87.3.1. The Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) regulations shall only apply to those parcels as shown on the official zoning map for the City of Gray.
87.3.2 The Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO) regulations shall NOT apply to single-family dwellings. The CDO regulations shall apply to all non-residentially used or zoned parcels that lie within 500 feet of the right-of-way of the following corridors within the Gray city limits as of the date of ordinance adoption. If any part of the parcel is within 500 feet of a designated corridor, then the entire parcel must conform. The corridors are defined as follows:
•
Gray Highway/US 129/Highway 11.
•
Monticello Highway/Highway 11.
•
Highway 22.
•
Highway 18.
•
Bill Conn Parkway.
•
Cumslo Road.
87.4. Relationship to underlying zoning regulations. The existing zoning map and underlying zoning regulations governing all properties within the Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) and Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO) shall remain in full force and effect. The special regulations contained within this chapter shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to the requirements of the zoning district within which a specific property is located. Except where it is otherwise explicitly provided, whenever the overlay district standards conflict with standards that would otherwise apply under this zoning ordinance, the most restrictive regulations shall control.
•
Within the Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO), property zoned R-1 (Single-Family Residential), R1A and R-2 and recognized as a lot of record at the time of adoption of the legislation are exempted. Individual single-family parcels not subject to the provisions of the site regulations are not controlled by the regulations of this overlay district ordinance.
87.5. Use limitations.
•
Permitted uses. Except for mobile buildings, trailers and manufactured homes, which are prohibited, all uses that are permitted in the underlying zoning district(s) shall be permitted in the Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) and Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO).
•
Amortization of nonconforming uses. When a nonconforming use is abandoned or discontinued for a period of 90 consecutive days, any subsequent use of the property thereafter must comply with the applicable regulations of the Gray Zoning Ordinance regarding the use of the property.
87.6 Conformance with design guidelines. All new development, redevelopment, and construction activity within the Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) and Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO) must conform to the City of Gray Design Guidelines Manual (Guidelines) as adopted. All modifications and additions to existing buildings must conform to the guidelines. The DRC shall weigh existing conditions against the specific requirements of the guidelines and may grant approval of a proposed modification or addition if they find that varying from the guidelines in this specific case does not have a negative impact on the surrounding area.
Prior to issuing an occupational tax certificate for the relocation of an existing business or for the establishment of a new business, the city clerk will require the applicant to provide written proof of zoning compliance.
87.7. Applicability.
87.7.1. All further development of the property in the DDO and CDO shall conform to the standards and guidelines adopted for the Districts, regardless of any change in ownership.
87.7.2. The violation of any provisions of the DDO and CDO standards and guidelines, as submitted and approved under the provisions herein, shall constitute a violation of these regulations.
87.7.3. Any application for rezoning to a DDO or CDO classification shall be submitted in accordance with the City of Gray's rezoning requirements.
87.7.4. To ensure that development and redevelopment within the DDO and CDO areas are consistent with the objectives of this section, each project is required to undergo a project review prior to the issuance of building permits by the City of Gray. The review requirements are outlined below in section 87.9.
87.8. Definitions.
•
Aggrieved party: One who demonstrates that his or her property will suffer special damage as a result of the decision complained of, rather than merely some damage that is common to all property owners and citizens similarly situated.
•
Certificate of design review (certificate): A document, required prior to a building permit, approving an application to make an alteration or a material change in the appearance of a property or of a structure, site, or work-of-art located in the Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) or Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO).
•
Connectivity: Development achieves "connectivity" when one or more land uses and parcels within the development have direct accommodations for both vehicles and/or pedestrians to travel between or among those land uses, and direct vehicular and pedestrian connections with compatible land uses on abutting properties. Direct accommodations for vehicles means that there is one or more alley, road, or driveway connections between the uses on the development site and among compatible uses on abutting sites (parcels), so that a vehicle can exit one development and enter the other development (i.e. cross property lines) without exiting onto a public street that provides principal access to the developments. Direct accommodations for pedestrians means that there are one or more sidewalks or other approved paths that allow a pedestrian to go from one development or parcel to another without using the sidewalk along a public street that provides principal access to the developments.
•
District: The area identified on the official zoning map of the City of Gray.
•
Design review commission: Reviews the architectural and site planning considerations and improvements proposed within the DDO and CDO.
•
Exterior architectural feature: The architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior of a structure, including, but not limited to, the texture of the building material, the type and style of all windows, doors, and signs, and other related architectural fixtures, features, details, or elements.
•

87.9.3. Nomination of commission members:

The list of nominees will specify the name of the person(s) who nominated each candidate and will verify that each candidate has consented in writing to serve. The majority vote of city council will determine the membership of the commission.

Removal will occur automatically if a commission member:

87.9.5. Meetings. The design review commission shall adopt rules of procedure as are necessary to carry out the purposes of its authority. The commission shall establish a regular monthly meeting date and time for its meetings. However, meetings shall be held only on an as-needed basis. All meetings shall be open to the public. The commission shall appoint a secretary to keep a record and minutes of its proceedings, showing the action of each commission member upon each question. The commission shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be filed with the city clerk and which shall be public records. The zoning enforcement officer shall serve as advisor to the commission.
87.9.6. Authority. The design review commission is authorized to receive, consider, grant, grant with conditions, or deny applications for design review as required by this ordinance. In granting approval of design review, the commission may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to the location, construction, maintenance and operation of any use or building, in addition to those expressly set forth herein, as may be deemed necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest. Decisions of the design review commission shall be final unless a written appeal to the mayor and city council is filed with the city clerk no later than 30 days after the date of the design review commission's decision.
87.9.7. Required design review/certificate of design review. Within the DDO and CDO, no material change in appearance shall be made and no building permit issued unless a certificate of design review (certificate) has been approved by the design review commission. Such material changes shall conform to all of the requirements as specified in the City of Gray Design Guideline Manual. Work not in compliance with a certificate of design review is prohibited.
87.9.8. Exemption for minor changes. There are certain types of routine maintenance activities that property owners can carry out without obtaining a certificate of design review. These activities are fairly narrow in scope, however, and depending on the extent of the maintenance effort, could require design review. The City of Gray Design Guidelines Manual should be consulted for additional information about routine maintenance items that do not require a certificate.
87.9.9. Certificate of design review application requirements and process. All applications for design review approval shall be made as required by the zoning enforcement officer and shall, at minimum, contain the following information:
(i)
Elevation drawings; color and material samples. Every application or review involving the construction of a new building or structure and alterations and/or additions to existing structures shall be accompanied by exterior elevation drawings drawn to scale and submitted in sufficient number of copies as required by the zoning enforcement officer. Said exterior elevation drawings shall clearly show, in sufficient detail the exterior appearance and architectural design of proposed change(s) to buildings or structures and new construction, as applicable. Each application shall also indicate proposed materials, textures and colors and provide samples of materials and colors. However, any "ordinary repair or maintenance" as previously defined in this document will not require such a certificate.
(ii)
Photographs. All applications shall be accompanied by photographs of all sides of the existing building(s) or structure(s) affected, and of adjoining properties. Photographs shall be submitted in printed copy unless otherwise specified by the zoning enforcement officer.
(iii)
Site plan and landscaping plan. For every application, a plot plan or site plan drawn to scale shall be submitted which shows all improvements affecting appearances, such as walls, walks, terraces, plantings, tree protection areas, accessory buildings, signs, lights, and other elements.
(iv)
Fee. A fee, as may be established by the mayor and city council, shall be submitted with each application.
(v)
Additional information. Any additional information, as may reasonably be required by the zoning enforcement officer, shall be submitted with the application.
87.9.10. All certificate of design review applications shall be submitted to the zoning enforcement officer at least ten days prior to the DRC's next regularly scheduled meeting. The zoning enforcement officer's written finding of completeness shall be required prior to processing the application.
87.9.11. For new developments, new buildings, and significant changes to existing developments and/or buildings, at least ten days before the next scheduled DRC meeting, an applicant may request from the zoning enforcement officer ("ZEO") a preliminary review by the DRC of the applicant's application or plans. Upon notification by the ZEO of the request for a preliminary review, the DRC will add the request to the agenda for its next meeting. The only purpose of a preliminary review is to assist the applicant in completing the application but in no event will result in a final approval or denial of the application. The completed application shall be submitted to the ZEO at least ten days prior to the DRC's next regularly scheduled meeting. The DRC shall review the application and make a final decision on the application at its next scheduled meeting.
87.10. Decisions on applications for certificates of design review. The design review commission shall utilize the City of Gray Design Guideline Manual in evaluating all proposed projects requesting a certificate of design review.
87.10.1. Standards for certificate of design review decisions. The DRC shall issue a certificate of design review if it finds the proposed change(s) in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the DDO and CDO districts.
The design review commission shall consider the appropriateness of any proposed material change in appearance in the context of the following criteria:
•
Consistency with the City of Gray Design Guideline Manual for the type of development and/or the proposed use.
•
The nature and character of the surrounding areas, and the consistency and compatibility of the proposed application with such nature and character.
•
The general design; the character and appropriateness of design, scale of buildings, arrangement, materials, texture and colors (non-painted surfaces), of the structure in question; and the relation of such elements to similar features of structures in the immediate surrounding area; site and landscaping.
•
The interior arrangement or use having no effect on exterior architectural features, safety or utility, shall not be considered.
•
Among other grounds for considering a design inappropriate are the following defects: character foreign to the area; arresting or spectacular effects; a multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance; and the absence of unity and coherence in composition not in harmony with the density and character of the present structure(s) or surrounding area.
87.10.2. Approval. If an application is approved, the DRC will issue a certificate of design review to the applicant for the proposed work on the property. The DRC has the responsibility to follow up with the applicant after the work has been completed to ensure compliance with the certificate of design review.
87.10.3. Denial. The DRC shall deny a certificate of design Review if it finds the material change in appearance would have a substantial adverse effect on the DDO or CDO district. If an application is denied, the DRC will notify the applicant in writing of its decision and state the reason(s) for the denial. The DRC may suggest modifications or alternatives to the proposed alternation or new construction. Applicants are strongly encouraged to meet with the DRC to discuss modifications which would make the project acceptable. The applicant may make modifications to the plans and resubmit a new or revised application for consideration by the DRC. The denial by the DRC shall be binding upon the zoning enforcement officer, and no building permit shall be issued.
87.10.4. Time limit for approval or denial. The DRC shall approve or deny an application for a certificate of design review within 30 days after a fully completed application is filed with the Zoning Enforcement Officer. Failure of the Commission to act within 45 days shall be deemed an approval of the application and no other evidence of approval by the DRC shall be needed.
87.10.5. Requirement of conformance with certificate of design review. All changes to existing buildings and proposed new construction shall conform to the certificate of design review issued for the project. In the event work is not performed in accordance with such certificate, the DRC shall notify the zoning enforcement officer to issue a stop work order.
87.10.6. Certificate of design review void if construction not commenced. An approved certificate of design review shall be valid for 18 months, after which time it shall expire. Upon expiration, a new application must be submitted and a new certificate of design review issued by the design review commission prior to commencement of any construction or building modifications.
87.10.7. Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the DRC relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of design review may appeal such determination to the City Council of Gray. The appeal must clearly set forth all alleged errors, and must be filed with the zoning enforcement officer's office within 30 days after the date of the DRC's decision. After a public hearing by the mayor and city council, the council may either approve the decision, modify the decision, or reject the decision, if it finds that the DRC abused its discretion by acting arbitrarily and/or in violation of constitutional rights in reaching its decision.
87.11. Amendments. Amendments to the DDO and CDO Districts will follow the same process as initial adoption. Any proposed amendments to the overlay boundary or individual properties must be publicly advertised and reviewed through established public hearing procedures of the comprehensive land development ordinance.
87.12. Severability. All ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are repealed to the extent necessary to give this ordinance full force and effect except that any ordinances repealed by this provision shall not limit or impair the City of Gray's authority to enforce such ordinances or resolutions to the extent that violations thereof occurred prior to repeal.
