ARTICLE VII. - STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEMS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 7.01. - Findings of fact and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that:
•
Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;
•
Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
•
The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
•
These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Lee County Greenspace Plan provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits;
•
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution.
Therefore, the Leesburg City Council has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff.
(b)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(2)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(3)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(4)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(5)
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan;
(6)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety;
(7)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up;
(8)
Develop policies, programs and projects that result in less impact to streams while creating sustainable communities;
(9)
Identifying opportunities in impacted watersheds, and where practicable to retrofit or improve existing Best Management Practices (BMPs), install new BMPs where needed, disconnect impervious areas, and improve stream stability and habitat.

Sec. 7.08. - General criteria.
(a)
A development's storm drainage facilities shall be designed so that there is no increase in the flooding of property upstream or downstream of the development without all the affected landowner's consent in the form of recorded drainage easements.
(b)
A system emphasizing a natural as opposed to an engineered drainage strategy shall be encouraged.
(c)
The storm drainage facilities shall have the hydraulic characteristics to accommodate the expected design flow of stormwaters, which consists of the:
(1)
Off-site and on-site stormwater, including stormwater coming into a tract from upstream;
(2)
Discharge of water into a natural drainageway; and
(3)
Means to convey water to a point where it will flow downstream into a stream, water channel or drainageway, or where it can be connected into an adequate existing or proposed facility.
(d)
Storm drainage facilities shall be designed on the basis of ultimate known or projected developments (proposed by the developer) for the tributary watershed. If a stormwater management basin (holding, detention or retention pond) is to be constructed, only the storage volume required for the immediate proposed construction is required to be constructed. As additional areas are developed, the additional storage volume is required to be constructed. Even though only what is required at the time of construction is to be built, the ultimate known development shall be totally designed for at the time of first proposed phase of development.
(e)
In no circumstances shall runoff be diverted to public or private property or public or private rights-of-way without recorded easements from the property owner.
(f)
No storm drainage shall empty into a sanitary sewer line or system.
(g)
Special consideration shall be given to innovative drainage designs that would not adversely affect the quality of development in a particular area.
(h)
No damming or ponding of water in gutters, public streets or other waterways shall be permitted except to a very limited extent where the manager of development services shall consider it necessary.
(i)
Flow or storage of water across, over, or on public streets or parking lots intended for use by the public, except through approved, properly constructed drainage systems, shall not be allowed during the storm event.
(j)
The 100-year flow pattern (overland and collection system) shall be defined, and any existing or future structures located in the overland flow path shall be elevated or constructed to above the defined flooding level. Final subdivision plats shall state which structures have minimum floor elevations.
Sec. 7.09. - Connection to existing stormwater system.
(a)
If a public stormwater sewer system is reasonably accessible as determined by the manager of development services, the developer shall connect such storm drainage systems and shall do all grading and provide all drainage structures necessary to properly carry the water to the storm drainage system.
(b)
If a public stormwater sewer system is not accessible as determined by the manager of development services, the developer shall not connect with such storm drainage systems and shall do all grading and provide all drainage structures that are necessary to properly carry water to locations in compliance with this article.
Sec. 7.10. - Residential subdivision lot drainage.
(a)
Residential subdivision lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern.
(b)
Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots.

The grade shall be sloped away from the structure for a distance of not less than 25 feet at a minimum grade of four percent (25:1 slope) and a maximum grade of 25 percent (4:1 slope).
(2)
Permit process.
a.
At building permit application submittal the builder shall:
1.
Sign an elevation affidavit form (provided by the building inspection department). On the affidavit the builder shall indicate the proposed elevation of the structure's finished floor and of the finished soil grade immediately outside of the structure. The finished floor elevation and the soil grade elevation shall be measured in relation to the road centerline elevation immediately adjacent to the structure (for lots with double road frontages the elevation may be to either of the roads). This may be as simple as stating:
i.
Existing road centerline elevation plus zero inches.
ii.
Finished soil grade elevation plus 12 inches above road centerline and
iii.
Finished floor grade elevation plus 24 inches above road centerline.
(3)
Field verification.
a.
For field verification the builder shall:
1.
Drive a two-inch by four-inch stake in the ground immediately outside of the foundation at the side of the structure facing the road. The stake shall have three marks. The marks on the stake shall indicate the elevation of the road centerline, the finished soil grade elevation, and the finished floor elevation. It shall be the builder's responsibility to determine the elevations and to verify to the building inspector that the three elevations are correct before any concrete is poured. If there is any discrepancy in the elevations as determined by the building inspector the builder shall be required to prove to the building inspector's satisfaction that the elevations are at least the minimum height above road centerline elevation. If the builder is not able to verify the elevations to the satisfaction of the building inspector then concrete shall not be poured until the problem is resolved.

If the lot is within or adjacent to the confines of a closed contour the engineer or surveyor shall certify that the building site for the dwelling is already at least three feet above the 100-year high water level. If the building site is not already at least three feet above the 100-year high water level the engineer or surveyor shall establish a finished floor elevation (FFE) so that the finished floor is at least three feet above the 100-year high water elevation of any potential ponding stormwater.
a.
The 100-year high water elevation shall include pre- and post-developed runoff coming to the site and shall include any stormwater retention or detention area whether manmade or natural. This shall include the ponding of stormwater on the lot in question or any adjacent lot or lots within the confines of a sub-basin drainage area located in the subdivision. This shall also include any basin area adjacent to the immediate subdivision phase but still impacting lots within that subdivision phase.
b.
If a finished floor elevation is required to be established then the formal elevation certificate process shall be followed; requiring that a flood elevation certificate shall be submitted prior to the building permit being issued and another one after the first finished floor is established to verify that the finished floor is at least at or above the established elevation. All applicable construction practices and floodplain development requirements shall be adhered to.
(d)
For any dwellings and appurtenances to include all infrastructure facilities and garages directly serving any dwellings built on individually subdivided lots located outside of the confines of a major subdivision or any lot located in a minor subdivision as defined in the subdivision regulations the following shall apply:

Requirements.
a.
All dwelling structures shall have the finished floors built to an elevation that is at least three feet above the highest adjacent natural soil grade immediately outside of the footprint of the foundation.
b.
Earthen fill shall be placed around the foundation of all dwelling structures so that the elevation of the soil grade immediately adjacent to the foundation of the structure shall be no more than 18 inches below the first finished floor on any side of the structure facing an uphill grade. (This requirement may be waived on any side of the structure where the natural grade falls away from the foundation.) The earthen fill shall slope away from the structure at a minimum grade of four percent (25:1 slope) and no steeper than a 25 percent (4:1 slope) from the foundation to the point where it ties in to natural dirt grade on the uphill side or sides of the structure.
(2)
Permit process.
a.
At building permit application submittal the builder shall:
1.
Sign an elevation affidavit form (provided by the building inspection department). On the affidavit the builder shall indicate the proposed elevation of the structure's finished floor as related to highest existing natural dirt grade immediately outside of the structure. This may be as simple as stating:
i.
Highest adjacent natural soil grade plus zero feet.
ii.
Finished soil grade on the uphill side of foundation to be not less than 18 inches below the first finished floor.
iii.
Finished floor grade plus three feet above highest adjacent natural soil grade.
(3)
Field verification.
a.
For field verification the builder shall:
1.
Drive a two-inch by four-inch stake in the ground immediately outside of the foundation at the point where the highest adjacent natural soil grade exists immediately outside of the foundation. The stake shall have three marks. The marks on the stake shall indicate: (1) the elevation of the highest adjacent natural soil grade; (2) the finished soil grade on the uphill side of foundation; and (3) the finished floor elevation. It shall be the builder's responsibility to verify to the building inspector that the three elevations are correct before any concrete is poured. If there is any discrepancy in the elevations as determined by the building inspector the builder shall be required to prove to the building inspectors satisfaction that the elevations are at least the minimum height above road centerline elevation. If the builder is not able to verify the elevations to the satisfaction of the building inspector then concrete shall not be poured until the problem is resolved.
(4)
Exemptions.
a.
Exemptions for relief due to extreme sloping lots and changes in topographic contours (vertically upward and away from the roadway) that would make it unreasonable to construct the structure with finished floors three feet above the highest adjacent natural dirt grade may be granted by the development services director provided the following information is submitted prior to a building permit being issued:
1.
A topographic survey of the lot showing one-foot contours stamped by either an engineer or surveyor licensed in the State of Georgia shall be submitted. The survey shall indicate the proposed location of the structure and all associated supporting infrastructure to include any well, septic tank and drain field, HVAC, etc.
2.
A letter from the engineer or surveyor detailing the reasons why the exemption should be granted. The letter shall indicate whether the existing natural dirt grade at the proposed building site is at least two feet above the centerline of the roadway fronting the structure.
i.
If the documentation provides supporting information that the requirement to elevate the first finished floor three feet above the highest adjacent natural dirt grade is extreme or unreasonable and that the structure shall not be threatened by any ponding stormwater then the development services director may wave the elevation requirement.

In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the development services director or his designee may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question.
Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control.
Sec. 7.28. - Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures.
The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under section 7.20. The applicant may, if approved by the development services director or his designee, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.
Sec. 7.29. - Drainage system guidelines.
Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public right-of-ways. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual;
(2)
All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual, and for all retention facilities shall account for the seasonal high water elevation as shown in section 7.23; and
(3)
Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual.
Sec. 7.30. - Dam design guidelines.
Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.
