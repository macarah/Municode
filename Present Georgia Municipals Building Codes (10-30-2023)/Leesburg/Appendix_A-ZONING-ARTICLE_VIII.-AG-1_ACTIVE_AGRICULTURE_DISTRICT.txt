ARTICLE VIII. - AG-1 ACTIVE AGRICULTURE DISTRICT

Sec. 8.01. - Statement of purpose.
The AG-1 Active Agriculture District was established for the purpose of preserving, promoting, maintaining, and enhancing the use of land for commercial agricultural purposes, to prevent scattered and leap-frog non-farm growth, to protect and preserve natural resource areas and to stabilize increases in public expenditures for such public services as roads and road maintenance, police and fire protection, and schools.
This district is designed to protect and preserve prime agricultural areas for continued agricultural and agriculturally oriented uses. Their loss cannot be readily compensated, since these prime agricultural areas are relatively scarce, particularly on the national level and other areas require more capital energy and nutrients to provide equal productivity. For these reasons, land should not be converted from the AG-1 district to another zoning classification unless and until there is no other land available in the city to accommodate the nonagricultural uses.
The standards and densities prescribed for this district are intended to preserve the open character of the area and thereby to protect the business of agriculture. This district is intended not to regulate agricultural uses, but to regulate those uses which threaten agriculture. The intent of these regulations for this district is to discourage subdivision of land for typical residential type lots requiring public services such as fire and police protection, paved roads, water, sewer, etc.
This district is generally intended to apply to lands in productive farm operations including:
(1)
Lands historically producing good crop yields or capable of such yields;
(2)
Lands productive for dairying, livestock raising and grazing;
(3)
Other lands which are integral parts of such farm operations;
(4)
Land used to produce specialty crops such as cranberries, mint, sod, fruits and vegetables; and
(5)
Lands capable of productive use through economically feasible improvements such as irrigation.
