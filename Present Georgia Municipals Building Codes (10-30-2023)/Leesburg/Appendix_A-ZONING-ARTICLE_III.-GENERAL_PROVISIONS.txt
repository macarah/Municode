ARTICLE III. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 3.01. - Applicability.
Except as hereinafter specifically provided, the regulations of this article shall apply.
Sec. 3.02. - Conflicting regulations.
Whenever any provision of this article imposes more stringent requirements, regulations, restrictions or limitations than are imposed or required by any other city ordinance this article shall govern.
Sec. 3.03. - Scope.
No building or structure, as defined herein, or part thereof, shall hereinafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, or altered and maintained, and no new use or change in use shall be made or maintained of any building, structure or land, or part thereof, except in conformity with the provisions of this article.
Sec. 3.04. - Only one principal building per lot.
Except as herein provided, there shall be no more than one principal building per lot other than within a planned unit development.
(1)
In residential zoning districts an "in-law suite" may be allowed. When such a second accessory dwelling is constructed, the following rules shall apply:
a.
The in-law suite shall not be larger than 75 percent of the footprint of the primary dwelling, with a maximum square footage of 1,500 square feet.
b.
The in-law suite shall be used for housing family members only. No in-law suite shall be rented to non-family members. No commercial use of the in-law suite shall be permitted.
c.
The in-law suite shall meet all building setback requirements for the zoning district in which it is located.
d.
Each in-law suite shall be so defined by permanent physical markers as to be given a numerical address and location designation.
e.
Each in-law suite shall receive approval from the county health authorities as to its suitability as a site for an effective sanitary sewage disposal system designed to accommodate wastes generated by the user of that land site.

(2)
For every 50 square feet, or fraction thereof, of required landscape area, one shrub a minimum of five gallons in size is required. Up to 50 percent of the required number of shrubs may be replaced by three-inch caliper trees at the rate of ten shrubs equals one tree.
(g)
Acceptable material. If a wall or fence is not used pursuant to this section, then the following must apply:
(1)
Multiple-family residential and non-residential property abutting single-family residential property. Where non-residential property abuts property zoned for residential use, landscaping shall be provided along the side and rear property lines so that a solid screen five feet in height when planted is formed and will, within a year, grow to six feet. If deemed necessary by the planning director, or his designee, due to topographical changes between the multiple-family residential or non-residential and residential property, the minimum height may be increased to eight feet. At a minimum, materials shall consist of 25 percent evergreen trees a minimum of six feet tall, 25 percent ornamental and/or shade trees with a minimum three-inch caliper or in small groups of ornamental and/or shade trees six feet tall having the same effect of a three-inch caliper ornamental and/or shade tree, and 50 percent evergreen and deciduous shrubs, provided that no more than 25 of the shrubbery may be deciduous. When planted, this landscaping shall form a continuous screen that is at least six feet in height.
(2)
Ground cover. Except where occupied by planting beds, all perimeter-landscaping areas shall be sodden or seeded. If seeded, grass shall be established through proper watering and fertilization as needed.
(h)
Preservation of trees. In order to encourage the preservation of existing trees, the area within the drip line of trees of 12 to 24 caliper inches that is protected by fencing during grading and construction and is included in the required landscape area shall receive double credit toward the required landscape area. If the tree is in the buffer area, such credit can be given in the buffer area as long as the desired buffer zone effect is accomplished. Otherwise, the credit shall be given to other areas, not located in the buffer area. Any tree 24 caliper inches or over shall be preserved, unless approved for removal by the planning director, or his designee where removal of such tree is mandated by development constraints that cannot reasonably be altered. If such tree is approved for removal, the tree must be replaced by a tree, or cluster of trees, that, when planted, has an overall caliper of at least six inches.

Sec. 3.13. - Animals in residential districts.
It is the intent of this section to permit in residential zoning districts the keeping of limited numbers of domestic animals where it is recognized that such areas are changing from agricultural to suburban residential in character. This section is further intended to minimize problems that may arise from such animal uses and to provide suitable standards for protection of health, safety, welfare and preservation of residential districts from inappropriate raising of animals.
(1)
The animals authorized herein shall be allowed only where the primary dwelling exists already and is on the same lot.
(2)
These provisions apply only to the outside of the residence on an individual lot and are not intended to restrict the type or number of animals kept entirely within a residence.
(3)
Animals permitted.
a.
Domestic pets. Cats, dogs, rabbits or other generally recognized domestic pets may be kept by persons residing on the property for their use and enjoyment.
b.
Livestock. Unless otherwise specified, horses may be kept in R-1 and R-3 residential zoning districts, provided that the lot is not less than five acres total, that the area where the horses are kept is not less than 50,000 square feet per every three such animals and that the area shall be fenced and maintained at least 25 feet from any property line. Up to three horses may be kept per each 50,000 square feet of fenced area.
c.
No keeping of livestock, fowl, domestic pets or any other animal shall become a nuisance as defined in the city nuisance ordinance.
(4)
Conditional uses. The following animals may be authorized upon conditional use permit being granted by the city council where authorized in R-1 and R-3 zoning districts.
a.
Livestock. Unless otherwise specifically stated, horses, cows, ponies, donkeys and other domestic livestock may be kept, raised or bred for home use and enjoyment; provided that the lot is not less than five acres total, that the area where the livestock are kept is not less than 50,000 square feet per every three such animals and that the area shall be fenced and maintained at least 25 feet from any property line.
b.
Fowl. Ducks, quail, chickens, turkeys, pigeons, pheasants, and other fowl may be raised for home use, provided such fowl are adequately contained within that property in the rear yard and at least 25 feet from any property lines.
(5)
Uses prohibited. The keeping, breeding or training of any animals or fowl for monetary gain or profit shall be deemed a commercial business and is expressly prohibited in all residential districts except where such operations may qualify as a nonconforming use as defined in this ordinance.
Sec. 3.14. - Conditional uses.
(a.)
Before a building permit shall be issued for a conditional use, application shall be made to the planning commission which, after public hearing and careful review of any applicable sections of this ordinance and the criteria below, may recommend to the city council the issuance of such permit or approval if in the judgment of the planning commission the application meets the criteria below and will not be detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the city.
(b.)
The public notice and procedures for the required public hearings by the planning commission and the city council shall be as set forth in article XVII herein.
(c.)
An application to establish a conditional use shall be approved following a public hearing and recommendation by the planning commission, and a public hearing and determination by the city council, that satisfactory provisions and arrangements have been made by the applicant concerning each of the following criteria, all of which are applicable to each application:
(1)
The proposed use shall not be contrary to the purpose of this article;
(2)
The proposed use shall not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood nor affect adversely the health and safety of residents and workers;
(3)
The proposed use shall not constitute a nuisance or hazard or otherwise provide inadequate provisions regarding the following: the number of persons who will attend or use such facility; vehicular movements, ingress and egress to the subject property and generation of traffic, noise, odor, dust or vibration generation that negatively impacts surrounding properties; or type of physical activity;
(4)
The proposed use can be adequately serviced by public or private facilities providing necessary services such as water, wastewater treatment, stormwater management, parks, utilities, and schools;
(5)
The proposed use will not be affected adversely by existing uses, and the proposed use will be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use; and
(6)
The parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted can be met.
(d.)
The planning commission may recommend and the city council may impose or require such additional restrictions and conditions as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community, to ameliorate any negative impacts of the proposal on surrounding properties, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood. Wherever the city council shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations that any term, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, said council shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
(e.)
Conditional uses shall not be transferable except upon written approval of the city council and shall be implemented within a period of 12 months from the time the use is granted or become null and void and subject to procedures for resubmission as established above and are subject to all other applicable laws and regulations.
Sec. 3.15. - Variances.
(a)
The city council shall authorize, after public hearing and review of the planning commission, in specific cases such variances from the terms of this ordinance as will not in its opinion, be contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this ordinance will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship. Such variance may be granted in such individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon consideration of the following criteria:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography;
(2)
The application of the ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship;
(3)
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
(4)
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public interest or impair the purposes and intent of this ordinance; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building which is prohibited by the zoning ordinance. The city will control the actual use of properties through zoning and conditional uses and not through variance.
(b)
In exercising the above powers, the city council shall not consider any nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same district, nor permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts, as grounds for the issuance of a variance.
(c)
The public notice and procedures for the required public hearings by the planning commission and the city council shall be as set forth in sections 17.03 and 17.04, provided that said notice and procedure provisions shall be modified when applied to variances so as to clarify that the matter being reviewed is a variance request.
(d)
The city council shall review the application materials and documents of record, the staff comments, the planning commission record and recommendation, and the facts and materials presented to the city council and apply the subsection (a) of this section variance criteria to make a final decision on the variance request. The final decision, and the basis for that decision, shall be set forth clearly in the minutes of the meeting at which the variance was decided.
(e)
Variances shall be implemented within a period of 12 months from the time the variance is granted or become null and void and subject to procedures for reapplying and are subject to all other applicable laws and regulations.
(f)
Any person aggrieved by a final decision of the city council regarding a variance is authorized to seek review of such decision by petitioning the Superior Court of Lee County for a writ of certiorari, setting forth plainly, fully and distinctly the alleged error(s). Such petition shall be filed within 30 days after the final decision of the city council is rendered.
Sec. 3.16. - Site plan review.
(a)
In order to assure that the requirements of this ordinance are complied with, all applications for a building permit shall be accompanied by a building site plan which shall conform to the following list of requirements and which shall be reviewed by the city planner, or his duly authorized representative, to determine compliance with this article before a building permit is issued. A building permit application shall not be issued for proposed site plans that do not meet all of the following requirements:
(1)
The site plan shall be drawn to scale. The planning director, or his designee, may request that the plan be drawn by a registered engineer or surveyor certified to work in Georgia if questions of flood zone locations exist within the property for which a building permit is being sought.
(2)
The plan shall show the complete outline of each proposed building at the location it is proposed to be built. The plan shall also show the actual size of the building to be erected. The plan shall also show all existing structures located on the property and their exact dimensions.
(3)
The plan shall show all property lines. The plans shall also show the actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon.
(4)
The plan shall show all required property setback lines. No part of any permanent structure shall encroach upon or violate any required setback.
(5)
The plan shall show the exact location of all easements on the property. No part of any permanent structure shall encroach upon any easement.
(6)
The plan shall show all parking, driveways, well location, septic tank location, drainfield location, trees larger than 24 inches in caliper and landscape buffers and all other requirements as set out in this ordinance.
(7)
The plan shall show all other structures on adjacent lots within ten feet of the appropriate property line.
(8)
The plan shall show front, side, and rear elevations indicating the building height from finished grade.
(b)
After the city planner or his duly authorized representative has approved the site plan such approval shall be noted on the permit application.
(c)
Before construction begins, the builder shall locate and clearly mark all lot corners.
(d)
At the time the building inspector conducts the foundation inspection, he may undertake whatever measurements he may deem appropriate including, but not limited to, measurements from the property lines to the proposed outermost edge of the building, so as to assure compliance with the approved site plan.
Sec. 3.17. - Flag lots.
Flag lots shall be subject to the following regulations:
(1)
Flag lots shall be measured from the mid-point between two opposite lot lines of the flag portion of the lot.
(2)
When calculating lot area the pole portion shall not be counted.
(3)
The minimum required lot area shall be the same as that required in the zoning district in which it is located.
(4)
The access pole must be part of the flag lot and must be under the same ownership as the flag portion. An easement shall not be allowed as a means of access to a flag lot.
(5)
Flag lots shall not be permitted whenever their effect would be to increase the number of driveways taking access to a collector or arterial road. Shared driveways shall be used to eliminate additional points of access. This criterion prohibits one of the most common abuses, the use of flag lots to avoid the developmental costs of roads. These sites are best developed without flag lots, even if the cost of the lots is thereby increased, since controlling access reduces congestion on major roads.
(6)
Any land division that creates one or more lots, flag or otherwise, with or without common access shall be a minor subdivision and shall meet all applicable regulations of the city subdivision ordinance.
(7)
All applicable regulations of the land development regulations must be met.
(8)
Flag lots have required building setbacks that must meet the requirements in the zoning district in which it is located. The pole portion shall not be considered when determining required building setbacks.
(9)
The access pole shall have a minimum width of 30 feet and shall not be greater than or equal to the minimum required width for building in the applicable zoning district. The purpose of this maximum width criterion is to prevent an abuse of flag lots in order to circumvent the city's length versus width requirement in the subdivision of lots. The maximum length of the pole of the lot shall be no more than five times the lot width of the flag portion.
Sec. 3.18. - Land conservation.
In order to protect open green space and to reduce the cost of development of a residential subdivision, this ordinance establishes density neutral development requirements by establishing the total number of units a specified amount of developable land will yield. This total yield must not include undevelopable areas such as stormwater management ponds, and similar areas. In order to protect significant natural areas, wetlands and other similar areas may be used to meet the greenspace requirement. Wetland areas may also be used to meet stormwater management requirements in accordance the land development regulations. In order to do this, where the property is to be developed as a major subdivision, the following process must be followed:
(1)
Delineate all unbuildable lands such as steep slopes, stormwater retention areas, etc.
(2)
Then, out of the remaining buildable land, determine the number of dwelling units desired, provided that the maximum density allowed by this ordinance is not exceeded.
(3)
Once subsection (2) of this section is done, where the property is to be developed as a major subdivision with at least a city-provided water system or a city-provided sewer system, unless otherwise specified, a minimum of 25 percent of the remaining developable land shall be preserved. Where the property is to be developed with wells and septic tanks, a minimum of ten percent of the developable land shall be preserved. Preservation under this section shall be accomplished by delineating any potential conservation areas such as significant tree stands, fields, historic or cultural areas. These areas shall be preserved as a common area for the residents of the subdivision. Unless the conservation area is conveyed to and accepted by the city, a legal entity such as, a homeowner's association, or trust for maintenance and care must be established and evidence thereof provided to the city and filed with the subdivision files. Such legal entity must have perpetual existence and be responsible for the continued preservation of the preserved land. Whenever an adjacent development has already preserved greenspace, all greenspace areas must be connected among the different developments in order to provide a connected greenspace "belt."
(4)
Once potential conservation areas noted in subsection (3) of this section are delineated, the next step is to locate potential house sites on the remaining land.
(5)
Once potential house sites are located, streets should be aligned with the houses. Trails, separate from public roads, may also be used to connect the house sites to allow neighborhood connectivity.
(6)
The final step is to draw in lot lines. These cannot include unbuildable lands noted in subsection (1) of this section or land delineated as conservation areas per subsection (3) of this section. Unless the entire property consists of buildable lands, both requirements of subsection (1) or (3) of this section must be complied with by the developer; provided, however, that in no event shall less than 25 percent of the total tract be preserved in developments where wells and septic tanks are not to be used, and no less than ten percent of the total tract shall be preserved in developments where wells and septic tanks are to be used.
Sec. 3.19. - Buffers in residential districts.
(a)
Applicability. This section shall apply to all new residential subdivision developments and additions thereto, where preliminary plat plans have not been approved prior to the date of adoption of this ordinance. New phases that are being developed under a previously approved general development plan will have to meet this requirement for all phases that have not received preliminary plat approval prior to the date of adoption of this ordinance.
(b)
Purpose and intent. The following regulations are designed to promote the health, safety, order, aesthetics and general welfare by protecting incompatible uses of land, providing for a more attractive residential environment, to promote desirable living conditions and the sustained stability of neighborhoods, assuring adequate open space, and reducing noise, night lighting, odor, objectionable view, loss of privacy and other adverse impacts and nuisances through the use of residential buffers and landscaping.
(c)
Submittal of buffer plans. A buffer plan shall be submitted to the planning and development department together with the preliminary plat. The buffer plan may be included on the preliminary plat. The following information shall be shown on the required plan:
(1)
Clearly state what level of service will be provided to the development and what level of service will be provided to adjacent residential developments.
(2)
Location and dimensions of areas to be buffer area.
(3)
Delineation of buffer area as restricted easement of private lots or dedicated to the city.
(d)
Level of service. Buffer areas shall be required between all developments served by a different level of public utilities. The levels of service of public utilities that may be provided are:
(1)
Level 1—Individual well and septic system.
(2)
Level 2—City water system and individual septic system.
(3)
Level 3—City water system and city sewer system.
(e)
Buffer area required. A minimum 20-foot natural or landscape-enhanced buffer shall be provided along the side and rear property lines of development with differing levels of service. This buffer area may account for the land conservation area required by section 3.18 of this ordinance. It is the responsibility of the developer to provide the required buffer area prior to final acceptance of the development by the city council.
(f)
Acceptable buffer.
(1)
Natural buffer. In cases where the natural vegetation is mature enough to provide a solid visual buffer there should be no disturbance within the buffer area. If the buffer area is included within a private lot, a restrictive easement shall be recorded with the lot indicating the area of easement, restricting use of the easement, and requiring the easement to remain undisturbed. The restrictive easement shall state that failure to leave the buffer undisturbed shall result in the property owner being required to bring the buffer area into compliance with the following subsection (f)(2) of this section.
(2)
Landscape-enhanced buffer. In cases where the natural vegetation is not adequate to provide a solid visual buffer between developments then landscaping shall be required to supplement the natural vegetation. This landscaped buffer area shall consist of trees and shrubs that are indigenous to the area and tend to grow well. All existing vegetation shall not be disturbed.
(g)
Installation and maintenance. The owner and/or user of the property shall be responsible for installing all required buffers and maintaining them in a neat and orderly appearance. Necessary trimming and maintenance shall be the responsibility of the property owner or user of the property to maintain the health of all plants, to provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance, and to assure that all buffers actually serve the purpose for which they were intended. In cases of noncompliance, the planning director, or his designee, shall be empowered to take action as provided by law to ensure maintenance of all plants and buffer areas.
(h)
Miscellaneous requirements.
(1)
No artificial plants, trees, ground cover or other artificial vegetation may be installed.
(2)
Areas reserved for stormwater detention/retention are not permitted within buffer areas. However, exceptions may be granted by the planning director, or his designee, if, after consultation with the manager of development services, no reasonable alternatives are available or undue hardship is shown.
(i)
Modification of buffer requirements. The planning director, or his designee, may approve minor variations to the buffer requirement due to unusual topographic restraints, sight restrictions, siting requirements, preservation of existing stands of native trees or similar conditions. The buffer plan shall be submitted and specify the modifications requested and present a justification for such modifications.
Sec. 3.20. - Fences.
Walls or fences shall be permitted in any zoning district and are not subject to setback requirements, except that in a residential zoning district:
(1)
No wall or fence shall exceed eight feet in height within a side yard or rear yard.
(2)
Any wall or fence that extends into the front yard shall not exceed three feet in height, except fences enclosing stormwater facilities that may not exceed six feet in height. Any wall or fence that extends into the front yard shall not encroach upon the right-of-way.
(3)
Fences enclosing tennis courts may not exceed 12 feet in height.
(4)
No wall or fence constructed of woven wire or metal fabric (hog wire, barbed wire, or similar types of fencing) shall extend into a front yard, except fences enclosing stormwater facilities that may be vinyl coated chain link. No wall or fence shall be constructed of exposed concrete block, tires, junk, wooden pallets, or other discarded materials. Chain-link fences are expressly allowed in front yards.
(5)

(8)
For the purpose of measuring the height of a fence under this section, such measurements shall be made from the ground directly below the fence and not from the bottom of the fence itself.
Sec. 3.21. - Sidewalks.
(a)
Sidewalks shall be located:
(1)
Along the street frontage of all non-residential developments. The planning director may waive the installation of sidewalks if the development is agricultural or located on a rural road section.
(2)
Along the street frontage of all developments within a one-half mile radius of any public school.
(2[3])
Along the interior streets of all residential developments with a minimum lot size of three-quarters acre or smaller.
(b)
Sidewalks shall be installed on one side of the street if there are fewer than 100 homes in the entire development. Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of the street if there are more than 100 homes in the entire development. The total number of lots in a development shall be calculated using all phases of the development, including phases already completed, phases included on the approved general development plan, and phases completed by other developers with the same subdivision name.
(c)
Sidewalks in subdivisions shall be continued to the nearest arterial street.
(d)
Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with section 8.12 of the land development regulations.

At the expiration of the two-year period, sidewalks shall be constructed by the developer in front of any lots where sidewalks have not already been installed by the home builder. Any damage to existing sidewalks caused by the developer or the home builder, or their respective agents or subcontractors, during construction on individual lots shall be repaired by the individual lot permit holder prior to a certificate of occupancy being issued for the residence being constructed. All repairs shall be in accordance with section 8.12 of the land development regulations.
Sec. 3.22. - Public water and sewer.
No building permit shall be issued and no building shall be occupied until public water and sewer, if available, are connected and in usable condition.
