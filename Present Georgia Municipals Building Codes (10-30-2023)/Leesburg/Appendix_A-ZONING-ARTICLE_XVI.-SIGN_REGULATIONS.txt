ARTICLE XVI. - SIGN REGULATIONS

Sec. 16.01. - Statement of purpose.
In adopting these sign regulations, it is the intent and purpose of the city council of the City of Leesburg not to impose an outright ban on signs, but instead to:
a.
Balance the right of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; and
b.
Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive land use planning; and
c.
Protect the public health, safety and welfare; and
d.
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; and
e.
Maintain the historical and cultural heritage and image of the city; and
f.
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; and
g.
Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs; and
h.
Promote economic development and tourism; and
i.
Protect private property values; and
j.
Ensure the fair consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
In accessing how to go about the above described task, the Leesburg City Council have given considerable weight and find the following to be relevant and useful to the Leesburg City Council concerning how the size, location and quantity of sign structures within the city must be regulated in order to achieve the above-stated intents and purposes: University of Georgia Land Use Clinic (2003, June 26), Sign Control on Rural Corridors: Model Provisions and Guidance; Wisconsin Department of Transportation (1994, December), Milwaukee County Stadium Variable Message Sign Study: Impacts of an Advertising Variable Message Sign on Freeway Traffic; Scenic America (2007), Billboards in the Digital Age: Unsafe (and Unsightly) at Any Speed. Scenic America Issue Alert; Nasar, Jack L. and Hong, Xiadong (1999, September), Visual Preferences in Urban Signscapes, Journal of Environment and Behavior, 31(5), 671-691; Office of Safety Research and Development, Federal Highway Administration (2001, September 11), Research Review of Potential Safety Effects of Electronic Billboards on Driver Attention and distraction, U.S. Department of Transportation; New York State Department of State, Division of Local Government Services (2006, January), Municipal Control of Signs, James A. Coon; Local Advertising in 268 U.S. Jurisdictions, Outdoor Advertising Association of America, Inc.; City Club of Portland (1996, September 6), Billboard Regulation in Portland; City Club of Portland Bulletin, 78(13), 1-40; Smiley, Alison and Persaud, Bhagwant, et al. (2205), Traffic Safety Evaluations of Video Advertising Signs, Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 1937, 105-112.
In adopting these sign regulations, the Leesburg City Council have carefully considered and especially recognize the case law coming from Georgia courts, the federal courts, and courts throughout the United States, which recognize that the regulation of the size, location and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the above-stated intents and purposes, and that such intents and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests, which include the following: Granite State Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga., 193 Fed. Appx. 900 (C.A.11th 2006) (finding that the stated goals within a sign ordinance of protecting against traffic hazards and the adverse impact on the count's aesthetic qualities are substantial government interests); Gregory v. Clive, 2007 WL 2914515 (Ga. S.Ct. 2007) (recognizing as within a local government's police power to enact legislation governing billboards and signs, as such legislation clearly addresses the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community); H & H Operations, Inc. v. City of Peachtree City, Ga., 248 Ga. 500 (1981)(holding that, under its police power, a municipality can enact and enforce reasonable regulations governing the erection and maintenance of signs within its jurisdiction); Harnish v. Manatee County, Florida, 783 F.2d 1535 (C.A. 11th 1986)(finding that aesthetics is a substantial governmental goal which is entitled to and should be according weighty respect, and that the governmental entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the environment must be given discretion in determining how much protection is necessary and the best method of achieving that protection); Lamar Advertising Company v. City of Douglasville, Ga., 254 F.Supp.2d 1321 (N.D.Ga. 2003) (finding that where a sign ordinance asserts the goals of public safety, traffic safety, health, welfare and aesthetics, a municipality has shown an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech); Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) (holding that the goals of traffic safety and aesthetics advanced by a municipality as justification for regulating signs is a substantial governmental interest); St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. City of St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269 (1919) (finding that billboards may be prohibited in the residential districts of a city in the interest of the safety, morality, health and decency of the community); Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) (finding that a government entity can regulate signs and billboards when necessary to advance a significant and legitimate state interest, such as the protection of the aesthetics and quality of life within its jurisdiction); City of Doraville v. Turner Communications, Corp., 236 Ga. 385 (1976) (finding that under its police power authority, a municipality can regulate the location and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs within their territorial jurisdiction); Spratlin Outdoor Media, Inc. v. City of Douglasville, 2006 WL 826077 (N.D.Ga. 2006) (upholding sign ordinance where the ordinance's height and setback restrictions were rationally related to its stated goals of promoting the health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community, promoting the orderly and beneficial development of the city, promoting adequate access to natural light and air, improving the aesthetic appearance of the city, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and buildings in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan).

2.
Application. Sign permits may be applied for by the owner of the property upon which the sign will be located, or by that person or entity's authorized agent.
