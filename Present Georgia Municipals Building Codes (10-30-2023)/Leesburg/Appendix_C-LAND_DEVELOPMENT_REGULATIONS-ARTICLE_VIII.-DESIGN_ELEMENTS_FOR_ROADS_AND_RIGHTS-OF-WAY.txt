Minimum clear sight distance. Minimum clear sight distance shall be calculated for wet pavement conditions at the various design speeds and using the K factors for the various types of streets. These sight distances shall be provided on both horizontal and vertical curves. For horizontal curves, the sight distance shall be checked by direct scale from the midpoint of the curb lane. The minimum vertical curve length required shall be calculated by multiplying the algebraic difference in grade times the K factor found in Tables 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5 for residential, nonresidential and collectors respectively. Vertical curves shall be designed into the roadway layout when meeting grades that are in excess of two percent.
(c)
Cul-de-sac specifications.

(e)
Minimum centerline offset of adjacent intersection.
(1)
Offsets of at least 125 feet between centerlines shall be required. In the case of two collector street intersections, this offset shall be increased to at least 150 feet in order to allow for left turn storage between intersections.
(2)
When offset intersections are used at an arterial they should be located to avoid conflicting left turns. Such left-turn conflicts exist when an intersection offsets to the right rather than to the left.
(f)
Minimum tangent length approaching intersection. See Table 5.6. The guidelines in this table would not apply to a collector with a 1,000 foot radius that is intersected by a residential street. It would apply to an intersecting residential street with a 200 foot radius leg.

(2)
Permanent traffic control devices shall be completely installed or constructed before the roadway is open to traffic.
(3)
The application of all types of traffic devices, whether they be of a permanent or temporary nature, shall be governed by the requirements and principles set forth in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).
(b)
Street name signs. Street name signs shall be of the type normally existing within the incorporated parts of the city. Any atypical sign shall be approved by the city council and shall meet all requirements for visibility by the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Signage shall be purchased from the city at the city's cost. The city will install all signs except atypical signs. Any atypical signs approved by the city council shall be installed and maintained at the sole cost and expense of the subdivision developer or the subdivision homeowners' association.
(c)
Traffic signs.
(1)
Each sign shall conform to the standards set forth in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Each sign shall be displayed only for the specific purpose described in the manual.
(2)
Signs shall be located to optimize night visibility and in conformance with safety factors related to fixed obstacles near the roadway. Signs shall not be located where they may obscure other signs or where they may be hidden from view by roadside objects. Signs requiring different decisions by vehicle operators shall be spaced sufficiently far apart for the required decisions to be made safely.
(3)
Stop signs shall not be erected at intersections controlled by traffic control signals and shall be removed if a traffic control signal is installed at the same location.
(4)
Signs shall have the maximum practical lateral clearance from the edge of the traveled way for the safety of vehicles that might leave the road and strike the sign posts. Sign posts and their foundations and sign mountings shall be constructed to hold signs in a proper and permanent position to resist swaying in the wind and to resist displacement by vandalism. Special care shall be taken to see that weeds, shrubbery and construction materials are not allowed to obscure the face of any sign.
(5)
Traffic control signs shall be of the type normally existing within the incorporated areas of the city. Signage shall be purchased from the city at the city's cost and included in the overall subdivision fee. The city will do all installation.
(d)
Traffic signals.
(1)
When it has been determined that a street or development requires the installation of a traffic signal the developer (or government for governmental projects) shall be responsible for all costs associated with the installation of the signal equipment.
(2)
The use of more than one signal head on each approach shall be mandatory.
(e)
Temporary safety requirements.
(1)
All temporary traffic control devices shall be governed by the following principles as described in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices:
a.
Traffic safety in work areas shall be an integral part and high priority element of every project from planning through design and construction. Maintenance work shall be planned and conducted with the safety of vehicle operators, pedestrians and workers kept in mind at all times.
b.
Traffic movement shall be inhibited as little as practical.
c.
Traffic movement shall be guided in a clear and positive manner while approaching and traversing work areas.
d.
To ensure acceptable levels of operation, routine inspection of traffic control elements shall be performed.
(2)
The closing of portions of any street shall be coordinated with the city manager and city police department so as to interfere with traffic as little as possible. Suitable barricades and signs to direct traffic shall be provided and appropriately placed and maintained as long as necessary. Such barricades and signs shall be promptly removed when no longer needed. The city public safety departments shall be notified in advance of the closing and reopening of any street.
(3)
Specific criteria described in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for the temporary closing of street shall be strictly adhered to.
(f)
Street lighting.
(1)
Streetlights shall be installed in all new major subdivisions or phases of major subdivisions in R-1, R-2, and R-3 zoning districts at the developer's expense and subject to the specifications of this ordinance. Major subdivisions are defined in section 1.08 of the subdivision regulations.
(2)
The developer shall contract with the electric service provider that provides coverage where the subdivision is located to purchase, install and perpetually maintain the lighting system. A copy of the executed contract between the developer and the service provider shall be included with the application for final subdivision approval.
(3)
Specifications.
a.
A lighting system plan meeting the specifications of this Ordinance shall be submitted along with all other plan sheets and required documents for approval of a land development permit.
b.
A light fixture shall be installed as follows:
1.
A lighting fixture shall be installed on the lot line, at every second lot on alternating sides of the road with intersections to be considered as a lot for design purposes.
2.
Right-of-way widths vary depending on whether roads are constructed using curb and gutter or open ditches for conveying stormwater. Therefore the following shall apply:
i.
On curb and gutter roads the light poles shall be set on the utility easement, one foot outside the right-of-way line.
ii.
On open ditch roads the grades of the front and back slopes of the stormwater conveyance ditches can vary from one project to another depending on the slope of the back ditch. The light poles shall be set so that the poles will not be located in the front slope, back slope or bottom of the ditch. In no case shall the light pole be installed in the functional stormwater conveyance portion of the ditch. All light poles shall be set at the top of the back slope, in the utility easement at least one foot outside the right-of-way line. If the point one foot outside the right-of-way line is still within the confines of the ditch then the pole location shall be moved further up the back slope until out of the active conveyance area of the ditch.
c.
All power cables providing electricity to street lights shall be buried within the utility easement and run parallel to the right-of-way. Any power lines passing under a city road supplying power to the opposite side of the road shall be installed in conduit and shall run parallel to the right-of-way line. No power cable or electrical conduit shall traverse a city roadway on a skewed angle to the right-of-way.

This shall include any roadway design; even those roads classified as less than a minor collector.
Sec. 8.08. - Driveway and right-of-way encroachment requirements.
(a)
General driveway topics. The purpose of this section shall be to provide standards and procedures for permitting the use of city right-of-way and easements and access to city roads in order to achieve the following:
(1)
For maximum protection to the public through the orderly control of traffic entering and leaving a part of the city roadway system to reduce traffic conflicts and confusion;
(2)
To make ingress and egress as safe as possible to the traveling public and to those who patronize the roadside commercial establishments;
(3)
To prevent hazardous and indiscriminate parking adjacent to the roadway surface;
(4)
To ensure uniform design and construction of driveways on the city roadway system;
(5)
To keep driveway construction from interfering with the safety of the traveling public; and
(6)
To provide for future modification and expansion.
(b)
Applicability. This standard is applicable to all roads under the jurisdiction of the city council including frontage roads and service roads of limited access highways. However, these provisions do not apply to roads under the jurisdiction of the state department of transportation.

(d)
Restoration. No person shall use city owned right-of-way or easements for any purpose for which a permit is required by this ordinance without first obtaining a permit therefor. In the event city owned right-of-way or easements are used and/or construction takes place without a permit, upon written notice by the manager of development services, the person shall remove any construction and restore the area to its original condition and cease any nonpermitted use.
(e)
Removal. Any construction within city owned right-of-way or easements that is done without the required permit or that is permitted but is not in compliance with all applicable requirements shall be altered to comply with the governing city ordinance or shall be removed from the right-of-way or easement. If the required corrective measures or removal has not been completed within 30 days of issuance of notice to comply issued by the manager of development services, the manager of development services shall take all action necessary to correct or remove the illegal condition. The city shall hold the party responsible for the illegal condition responsible for all costs incurred in correcting or removing the illegal condition and take all action necessary to recoup those costs.

Rural radii shall not approach the boundary lines except as provided in this ordinance and shall not encroach upon the arc of a curve connecting the curb or edge or pavement at an intersection. In all cases a minimum eight-foot tangent section shall be required between all driveway radii and all roadway intersection radii. The range of radii vary from ten to 30 feet for a driveway. The radius for long wheelbase vehicles shall not exceed 30 feet. When planning for passenger vehicles the radius shall be six feet. For small truck traffic the radii lengths shall be 15 feet. When the angle of the intersection of the inside edge of the driveway and the line paralleling the highway pavement is 45 degrees; a five-foot radius shall be used. This shall be increased to 7½ feet when the angle is 60 degrees and ten or 15 feet or larger if the intersection angle is 90 degrees.
(2)
Urban radii shall not approach the boundary lines referred to in this ordinance or encroach upon the arc of the curve of the edge of the pavement or curb connecting intersecting streets or roads. The driveway radii shall not be greater than 35 feet except where there is little pedestrian traffic in which case the radii may be increased if required to prove a satisfactory entrance appropriate for the type of vehicles which the driveway is designed. The acute angle radius shall not exceed five feet. When curb and gutter are removed for the purpose of constructing a driveway, the driveway shall be constricted of equivalent material. The entrance curb shall be of the same design and material as the existing curb and gutter to which it is joined.
(e)

(f)
Grade.
(1)
Residential driveways (single-family, duplex, triplex, quadraplex only): the driveway grade shall not exceed eight percent maximum change within the right-of-way area. Of great importance is the change in grade, which shall not exceed 12 percent within the ten feet of distance. Car bottoming on the crest can be avoided by use of eight percent maximum change per ten feet as required.
(2)
Nonresidential driveways:
a.
Rural as determined by the manager of development services. The grade of the driveway shall slope downward and away from the road surface at the rate not less than 2.08 percent or more than 6.25 percent out to the road ditch line, but in no case less than 18 feet from the edge of the pavement. Where the roadway pavement is super-elevated and the upper shoulder is graded to the slope of the pavement, the grade of the driveway shall conform to the slope of the shoulder to a point 12 feet from the edge of the pavement. However, beyond this 12-foot line the driveway and islands shall be designed to rollover grade so that water from this area will not flow onto the roadway shoulder or pavement. In some cases it may not be feasible to continue the slope of the pavement upward with the super elevation. In such cases the manager of development services shall make this determination during his inspection and review of the permit request and will revise the plans submitted accordingly, as well as provide adequate documentation as to why this variance was made in this particular instance. Through the remaining right-of-way width the grade of the driveways shall not be greater than 6.25 percent, positive or negative. In areas where the right-of-way exists the elevation of the driveway at the right-of-way line shall not be more than one foot higher or lower than the edge of the road at the point opposite that point on the driveway unless specifically waived by the manager of development services and documented on the plan as to why the waiver was justified.
b.
Urban as determined by the manager of development services: The grade of the driveways shall usually conform to the grades to the back of the gutter. When curb or curb and gutter exists, the grade of the driveway shall not exceed the grades set forth in the preceding paragraph in this ordinance. Where curb and gutter does not exist the grade shall conform to the rural requirements.
(g)
Joint driveways.
(1)
The maximum width of a joint driveway shall be 40 feet. A joint driveway shall be at 90 degrees with the highway. Its location may result in unequal areas of the driveway on each frontage. The side of the joint driveway shall be parallel one with the other as required for individual driveways.
(h)
Driveway sides.
(1)
The two sides of any driveway shall be parallel.
(i)
Lane use and paving.

Sec. 8.23. - Street tree standards.
All street tree planting, removal and maintenance shall be performed in accordance with these standard specifications.
The street trees planted in the City of Leesburg shall be those trees approved by the director of public works or his designated representative. A permit for planting street trees may be obtained through the office of the director of public works, department of public works.
(a)
Standard specifications for planting street trees.
Planting of street trees shall be subject to approval and inspection by the director of public works or his designated representative, who shall be notified not less than 48 hours prior to the anticipated time of planting.
The following specifications shall apply to the size and method of planting said street trees:
(1)
On lots of frontage up to 80 feet, trees shall be planted one to the lot; on lots of frontage over eighty feet, trees shall be planted two to the lot; on corner lots the number of trees required on the side street shall be determined by the depth of the lot and location of underground utilities.
(2)
On streets where the sidewalk has been, or will be, located adjacent to the curb, trees shall be planted as per specifications of the respective project. On streets where there is, or will be, space between the walk and curb, the trees shall be planted midway between the walk and curb.
(3)
Planting locations on major streets shall be determined by the director of public works or his designated representative. The following spacing standards shall be adhered to:
a.
On corner lots, 30 feet from the beginning of curb radius (BCR) on the approach to an intersection and 30 feet from the end of curb radius (ECR) on the exit side.
b.
Thirty-five feet from adjacent trees planted in the public right-of-way.
c.
Fifteen feet from street light standards, power poles, fire hydrants and street signage.
d.
Ten feet from sewer laterals.
e.
Eight feet from the edge of driveway approaches (measured from the curbside, not sidewalk side of the parkway).
f.
Eight feet from water meters, gas lines, underground electrical or telephone and cable communication lines and boxes.
g.
Five feet from privately installed service or house walks.
h.
Ten feet from other hardscape or underground improvements not included in the above (i.e., storm drains, drain lines, etc.)
(4)
Trees shall be vigorous, in a healthy condition, of good structure and free from diseases and insects, pests or the effects of previous infestation. Trees shall be not less than 15 gallons in size, minimum height of six feet, single-trunked and of standard form with an established root ball free of kinked and circling roots. On residential and commercial projects, an inspection of street trees shall be performed by the director of public works or his designated representative prior to trees being planted in the public right-of-way.
(5)
Trees shall be planted in holes 30 inches in depth and 30 inches in width. The planting holes shall be excavated so that the sides taper outward into the soil; the sides of the planting holes shall be roughened, not smoothly sculpted, which shall allow roots to penetrate more easily into the surrounding soil. The planting holes shall be filled with water and allowed to completely seep prior to planting. Trees shall be planted one to two inches above ground/grade level; the trunk flare shall be exposed above ground/grade level. Trees shall be installed with four 21-gram slow-release Agriform plant fertilizer tablets or equivalent evenly spaced within the top eight to 12 inches of soil and two inches from the root ball; the two-thirds backfilled planting holes shall be filled with water and allowed to completely seep. Backfill of the planting holes shall be completed, eliminating all clods and debris, and lightly tamp in soil with feet or shovel handle to insure there are no air pockets and that the soil is reasonably firm. Mulching is desirable up to two inches in depth, as a layer above the native soil; however, mulch should not come in contact with the trunk flare.
(6)
Nursery stakes shall be removed. Trees shall be staked parallel to the frontage and positioned perpendicular to prevailing wind with two two-inch diameter, round, pressure-treated, pencil-point lodgepole pine stakes, eight or ten feet long (use appropriate size to match height of tree(s) to be planted), driven just to the outside of the tree root ball (approximately ten inches) and embedded a minimum of two feet into the ground. Trees shall be tied to the stakes in two or more places with soft-rubber cinch ties or equivalent at the lowest points possible to maintain the tree in an upright position and nailed to each stake with one aluminum or galvanized roofing/shingle nail. Trees shall be installed with one trunk guard/protector or equivalent.
(7)
At the time of planting, trees shall be surrounded with an earthen basin or "berm" of not less than 30 inches in diameter, inside measurement, and six or more inches in height.
(8)
All trees shall be watered thoroughly the day they are planted. Owners and/or occupants of real property fronting on a public street(s) shall be responsible for continued adequate watering of the street tree(s) abutting their property. The abutting property owner shall bear the expense of replacement of street trees where death is the result of insufficient water and/or general negligence. Owners and/or occupants shall be provided with a new tree care door hanger to assist with any questions that the owner and/or occupant may have in regard to watering, fertilizing and any special care requirements that may be needed to insure the survival of the newly planted street tree(s).
(9)
All trees shall be planted in accordance with tree planting methods approved by the director of public works or his designated representative, in order to ensure the growth and survival of the tree(s). Final inspection on all residential projects and commercial projects shall be performed after all interior landscaping is completed. This inspection shall be performed by the director of public works or his designated representative prior to the acceptance of fulfillment of the above standard specifications. A 48-hour notice shall be given before any final inspection.
(10)
When tree root barriers, grates, drainage/aeration piping, irrigation or paving stones are required as part of the planting of street trees, all installation work shall be in strict accordance with the methods recommended by the manufacturer and/or the City of Leesburg Public Works Department.
(b)
Standard specifications for removal of a street tree or shrub.
Permission for the removal of a recognized City of Leesburg street tree or shrub (over 42 inches in height) shall be issued only when the necessity for such removal exists as determined and approved by the director of public works or his designated representative.
When a street tree or shrub is removed under authority of this section, the following shall be adhered to:
(1)
Property owner shall obtain a permit from the director of public works or his designated representative and pay all applicable fees (i.e., permit, inspection, service request, performance bond).
(2)
The stump shall be removed to a depth of two feet below the surface of the ground/grade level. All surface roots shall be removed to a depth at least six inches below ground/grade level.
(3)
The grinding chips are to be removed and the hole(s) shall be backfilled with native soil. The soil shall be compacted and level to grade suitable for seeding.
(4)
All debris shall be removed from sidewalks as soon as practicable. No debris shall remain at the work location overnight.
(5)
A tree being removed shall be replaced by a designated tree from the director of public works or his/her designee according to the following schedule:
a.
If the tree being removed is less than 6½ inches in diameter, then the replacement tree assessment shall be a tree 15 gallons in size.
b.
If the tree being removed is 6½ inches in diameter, but less than 12½ inches in diameter, then the replacement tree assessment shall be a 24-inch box size tree.
c.
If the tree being removed is 12½ inches in diameter or greater, the replacement tree assessment shall be a 36-inch box size tree.
If a property owner does not wish a tree to be replaced after it is removed, the city shall replant the intended replacement tree at a location, in the city, which shall benefit the most from its placement according to the director of public works or his/her designee.
(c)
Standard specifications for street tree maintenance.
Maintenance of street trees shall be subject to approval and inspection by the director of public works or his/her designated representative. The instructions in this section are minimum specifications which shall be observed in maintaining street trees.
(1)
It shall be the responsibility of the City of Leesburg to prune all street trees, as determined by the city, abutting public or private property regardless of whether such property is developed.
All work shall be in accordance with the latest pruning standards for street/shade trees established by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI), International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) and National Arborist Association (NAA). A copy of the most current of these standards shall be filed in the office of the public works director or his designated representative.
(2)
Owners and/or occupants of real property fronting on a public street may raise the lower limbs only on the adjacent street tree(s) abutting their property. On the street side and on the sidewalk side, where practical, street trees may be raised 15 feet from the top of the curb and ten feet above the grade of the sidewalk, without detracting from the natural shape of the tree(s) provided the owner and/or occupant of the real property first obtains a permit from the office of the public works director or his designated representative. It shall be the responsibility of the owner and/or occupant to properly maintain the parkway planting strips abutting their property regardless of whether such property is developed. All trees on private property and over-hanging into the public right-of way shall be kept trimmed by the owner and/or occupant so as to provide a minimum clearance height of 15 feet from the top of the curb and ten feet above the grade of the sidewalk, allowing sufficient vehicular and pedestrian clearance and without detracting from the natural shape of the tree(s).
(3)
Tree pruning shall include the removal of all dead, broken, diseased, insect infested limbs and stubs larger than one-half inch in diameter throughout the tree. The tree shall be thinned out by the removal of a minimum of 30 percent of the internal side limbs.
(4)
Tree limbs shall be shortened which extend beyond the natural perimeter of an otherwise symmetrical form.
(5)
Limbs shall be pruned to lighten the end weight where such overburdening appears likely to cause breakage of limbs two inches or more in diameter. This shall require a 20 to 30 percent reduction in height and width in some types of trees. Only the "drop crotch" method of pruning shall be used in this instance. All cross limbs and water sprouts (suckers) shall be removed to improve structural integrity, safety and aesthetics.
(6)
All trees on which vines are growing shall have said vines removed. Vine tendrils shall be removed in a manner which shall not injure trees or cause scarring of low branches and tree trunks.
(7)
All pruning cuts shall be made without leaving a stub. Pruning cuts shall be made in a manner that favors the earliest possible covering of the wound with callous tissue growth. This requires that the wound created by the pruning cut be as small as practicable; the cut must be reasonably flush with the branch bark ridge and the cambium tissues at the edge of the cut must be alive and healthy. Extremely large flush pruning cuts which produce large wounds and weaken the tree at the point of the pruning cut shall not be made.
(8)
Tree pruning and cutting tools shall be kept sharpened to a condition that shall permit an unabraised cambium edge on all pruning cuts. All tools shall be kept clean and sterile to prevent the spread of infectious materials and/or diseases throughout the street tree population.
(9)
The use of climbing spurs or spike shoes shall not be permitted.
(10)
The pruning of all street trees shall provide adequate clearance as determined by the city for mast arm, globe, utility line or sign, electrical lines, luminaires, luminaire mast arms, utility lines, telecommunication lines, official traffic control devices, traffic signals and other public facilities and appurtenances.
(d)
Appeal process. Any person wishing to appeal the action of the public works director or his designated representative may do so in writing to the department of public works within 15 days of such decision by the director of public works or his designated representative. If the written appeal application is denied by the director of public works, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Leesburg City Council. The decision of the Leesburg City Council shall be final.
