Sec. 111-2. - Authority.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to O.C.G.A. title 36, ch. 70 (O.C.G.A. § 36-70-1 et seq.).
(Code 1993, pt. III, ch. 1, § 2)
Sec. 111-3. - Applicability.
(a)
General applicability. Except as provided below, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development in the city. No development shall be undertaken without prior authorization pursuant to the provisions in this chapter.
(b)
Application of zoning regulations.
(1)
Height and density. No building or other structure shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, so as to:
a.
Accommodate or house a greater number of persons or occupy a smaller lot area per person;
b.
Occupy a greater percentage of lot area; or
c.
Have narrower or smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards, or other open spaces; unless in conformity with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located.
(2)
Yard service to one building. No part of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading space required in connection with any building for the purpose of complying with this chapter shall be included as a part of a yard, open space, or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other building.
(3)
Only one principle building. Every building or structure hereafter in an R-15, R-12, R-M, R-I, or R-P zoning district shall be located on a lot or tract as defined herein; and in no case shall there be more than one principal building on one lot, plus its accessory structures.
(4)
Reduction of lot area. No lot, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced so that the lot width or depth, front, side or rear yard, lot area per unit or other requirements of this chapter are not maintained. This section shall not apply when a portion of a lot is subsequently acquired for public purposes.
(5)
Street frontage. No building shall hereafter be erected on a lot which does not abut or have immediate frontage on a publicly-dedicated, publicly-approved, or publicly-maintained street.
(6)
Traffic flow. Development permits for new commercial structures, new multifamily dwelling units, or existing commercial structures shall be reviewed for adverse traffic impact by the city's community development department. If it is determined upon review of a traffic study developed by a state registered engineer that there exists reasonable grounds to believe that specific improvements are needed to accommodate the perceived adverse traffic impacts of the development, such improvements shall be completed prior to and as a condition precedent to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Such improvements may include, but are not limited to, roads, alleyways, sidewalks, curbing, drainage, directional signs, or any other device or construction for the benefit of the public.
(c)
Exception for previously issued development permits. The provisions of this chapter and any amendments hereto shall not affect the validity of any lawfully issued and effective development permit, if:
(1)
A building permit was issued for the development prior to adoption date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived on February 28, 2011; and
(2)
The development activity continues without interruption until the development is complete. If the development permit expires, any further development on that site shall occur only in conformance with the requirements of this chapter.
(d)
Zoning in progress.
(1)
Purpose. The zoning in progress rule allows the city to make a text or map amendment to this chapter, and apply that change to development applications submitted after the declaration has been made of a zoning in progress.
(2)
No permits issued and period of time. During the period of time that the city commission is considering either a text or map amendment to this chapter, no permits, licenses, or other development orders of any kind shall be issued if issuance would result in the nonconforming or unlawful use of the subject property should the text or map amendment change be enacted by the city commission (rest period). The maximum freeze period allowed for a zoning in progress shall be three months, except that the city commission may extend the period of up to an additional three months for good cause, and if it makes a finding that it is in the public interest to do so.
(3)
Notice of declaration. The declaration of zoning in progress, and rest period on development orders, permits and licenses shall begin on the earlier of:
a.
Publication of a notice of a public hearing before the city commission to consider a resolution declaring a zoning in progress; or
b.
Public notice given as required by law for the initial public hearing on a text or map amendment to this chapter.
(4)
Applicability.
a.
Upon adoption of a text or map amendment, all pending applications, permits, licenses, and other development orders shall conform to the new provisions.
b.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, no application for a text or map amendment to this chapter, or permit or development order, shall be held up by this procedure for more than six months, including all time periods described herein.
c.
If it is determined by the city community development director that an application for a text or map amendment, or permit, license, or other development order would not violate the provisions of a pending zoning measure, such application, and any subsequent permits, licenses and other development orders, shall be exempt from this section.
(Code 1993, pt. III, ch. 1, § 3)
Sec. 111-4. - Findings; general public needs.
The city commission finds that controlling the location, design and construction of development within the city is necessary to maintain and improve the quality of life. The city commission further finds:
(1)
A single set of administrative procedures for making all land use decisions promotes efficiency, predictability and citizen participation.
(2)
All development proposals, excluding single-family homes or the re-use of an existing building where the re-use does not create a greater impact, must undergo a development review process to ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
(3)
All administrative decisions should be supported by a record with written findings to ensure accountability and efficient appellate review.
(4)
A quick and efficient avenue of appeal should be available for all ministerial and administrative decisions.
(5)
Enforcement of development permits and the provisions of this chapter should be through procedures that are efficient, effective and consistent with the code enforcement procedure established by state law.
