Appeals, hearings, and notice. It is the intention of this section that all questions arising in connection with the interpretation and enforcement of this chapter shall first be presented to the city manager, and that such questions shall be presented to the zoning board of appeals only on appeal from the decision of the city manager, and that from the decision of the zoning board of appeals, recourse shall be to the courts as provided by the law.
(1)
Appeals to these regulations may be taken to the zoning board of appeals by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the city. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board by filing with the city manager from whom the appeal is taken and with the zoning board of appeals notice of said appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The city manager shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
(2)
An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the commission after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with the city manager, that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the officer's opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or by a court of record on application, on notices to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown.

The commission shall fix a time not less than 15 days, nor more than 45 days, for the hearing of the appeal or other matter referred to it, and give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time.

(2)
To authorize, upon appeal, in specific cases a variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, vowing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship so that the spirit of this Code shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the zoning board of appeals that:
a.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography;
b.
The application of this chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship;
c.
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
d.
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of this chapter; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited in a given district by this chapter.
(3)
To decide on other matters where a decision of the zoning board of appeals may be specifically required by the provisions of this chapter. In exercising these powers, the zoning board of appeals may be reversed or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. The board, in the execution of the duties for which appointed, may subpoena witnesses and, in case of contempt, may certify such fact to the superior court.

If the community development director shall determine that a wall or fence is unsightly or deteriorated, the owner or occupant of the property where the fence or wall is located shall be notified of that fact by certified mail. If the owner or occupant of the wall or fence is unknown and cannot be located, such notice may be posted on the wall or fence.

(c)
The mandatory fencing or walling provisions in article VII of this chapter shall only be applicable to property after application is made for the issuance of a building permit for a new principal building on the property, unless the city commission determines that, as to buildings existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the lack of such fencing creates an unwarranted interference with the property use and enjoyment of neighboring properties and thus constitutes a public nuisance, which must be abated by the erection of the fence or wall mandated for new principal buildings in that zoning district.
