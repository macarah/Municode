ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 10-1. - Garage sales.
(a)
Garage sales held by individuals for the purpose of disposing of personal items no longer needed or wanted may be held within the corporate limits of the city subject to the further provisions of this section; provided, however, no such sale may be conducted without first receiving a permit from the city. The permit shall be issued by the city marshal for a fee as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges. The permit shall state the date or dates of the sale, the name of the person conducting the sale, and the location of the sale. It shall be a violation of this section to conduct a garage sale without first obtaining a permit. To receive a permit pursuant to this section, an applicant must be a resident of the county. Only two sales may be held by an individual in any calendar year, and they shall last no more than two consecutive days. A garage sale may be conducted on any property located in the city provided the owner or lessee thereof grants permission for the sale to be so held. For the purpose of this section, the term "garage sale" shall be interpreted as yard sale, rummage sale or like term.
(b)
Any person found guilty of violation of the conditions of this section by a court of competent jurisdiction shall pay a fine as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges.
