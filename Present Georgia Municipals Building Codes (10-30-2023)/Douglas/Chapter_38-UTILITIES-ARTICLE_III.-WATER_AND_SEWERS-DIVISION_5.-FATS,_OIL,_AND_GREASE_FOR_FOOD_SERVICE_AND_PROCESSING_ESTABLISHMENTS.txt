DIVISION 5. - FATS, OIL, AND GREASE FOR FOOD SERVICE AND PROCESSING ESTABLISHMENTS
Subdivision I. - In General

Sec. 38-477. - Purpose.
(a)
The objective of this division is to help prevent sanitary sewer blockages that can cause untreated wastewater to back-up into homes and businesses and overflow into the environment. Many of these obstructions can be caused by the introduction, discharge, and contribution of fats, oils, and greases (FOG) into the city's publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs) by commercial, industrial, institutional, and all other nonresidential food preparation and processing activities. The city, as a state EPD delegated control authority, is required to regulate FOG to comply with the federal Clean Water Act (40 CFR 403) and the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20) and to protect state waters, public health, and its POTW.
(b)
The requirements of this division shall be in addition to the requirements of division 4 of this article.
(Code 1993, pt. II, § 90-310; Ord. No. 062608(1) , § 1, 6-26-2008)
Sec. 38-478. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. Where certain words, terms or phrases related to pretreatment regulation are not herein defined, those words shall have the meaning defined in division 4 of this article.
Best management practices means schedules of activities, such as prohibitions of practices; general good housekeeping, pollution prevention, and educational activities; operations and maintenance procedures; and other practices established by facility management to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants, directly or indirectly, into the city's stormwater system or waters of the state or the United States.
City means the City of Douglas, Georgia, or its duly authorized representative.
Commercial wastes means nontoxic, nonhazardous liquid wastewater from commercial facilities.
Contact person means the individual responsible for overseeing the daily operation of the food service or processing establishment and who is also responsible for overseeing the establishment's compliance with this division.
Establishment or facility means a building or a location, as identified by the address used for postal deliveries, where food service or processing, as defined in this section, occurs.
Fats, oil, and grease (FOG).
(1)
The term "fats, oils and grease (FOG)" means all greases, grease complexes, fats, oils, scum, sludges, and all other organic polar compounds derived from animal and/or plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride molecules, that may solidify or become viscous between the temperatures of 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius to 65 degrees Celsius), and that separate from wastewater by gravity. Such substances are detectable and measurable using analytical procedures established in 40 CFR 136. While FOG is most commonly associated with fried foods, FOG also comes from cooking meats, dairy products (butter, cheese, ice cream, etc.), mayonnaise, salad dressings, creams, and sauces.
(2)
In the wastewater collection system, FOG coats the interior surface of pipes, eventually clogging the pipes and causing backups and overflows into the environment (ground, waterways, etc.). At the treatment plant, FOG can interfere with treatment operations, resulting in insufficient treatment of pollutants before discharge into state waters. FOG is a regulated pollutant (division 4 of this article).
FOG trap or FOG interceptor.
(1)
The term "FOG trap" or "FOG interceptor" means a device that is designed, installed, and operated in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications for separating and retaining FOG in the trap or interceptor prior to the wastewater entering the city's POTW. The FOG interceptor also collects floating and settleable materials generated by or incidental to food service and processing activities.
(2)
The term "FOG trap" usually refers to a small indoor reservoir built into the kitchen wastewater piping, a short distance from the FOG bearing drains that discharge into it, installed above or below the floor level. Baffles in the reservoir retain the wastewater long enough for the FOG to congeal and rise to the surface. The FOG can then be removed and disposed of properly. FOG trap maintenance is usually performed by maintenance staff or other employees of the establishment.
(3)
The term "FOG interceptor" usually refers to a large capacity underground vault with a minimum capacity of 750 gallons that is located outside of the establishment. The vault includes a minimum of two compartments and flow between each compartment is through a 90 degree fitting designed for FOG retention.
(4)
The large capacity of the interceptor provides a higher residence time (than a FOG trap) so that the wastewater has time to cool and FOG can congeal and rise to the surface as solids settle out. FOG interceptor maintenance consists of removing the entire contents (liquids and solids) from the interceptor and properly disposing of the material in accordance with federal, state, and/or local rules and laws and is performed by a permitted commercial waste transporter.
Food processing establishment means a permitted user primarily engaged in the manufacture or packaging of foodstuffs for human consumption, without using any form of cooking at the establishment. Such establishments include, but are not limited to, raw poultry and meat handling/packaging facilities and poultry slaughterhouses.
Food service establishment means a permitted user primarily engaged in the activities of cooking, preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for human consumption, any form of foodstuff and which uses one or more of the following cooking or preparation methods in connection with such activities: cooking or preparation by frying (all methods); baking (all methods); grilling; saute rotisserie cooking; broiling (all methods); boiling; blanching; roasting; toasting; poaching; or any type of cooking or preparation that produces a hot nonpotable or nonedible product in or on a receptacle that requires washing, rinsing or other form of cleaning. Such establishments include, but are not limited to, restaurants, coffee shops, luncheonettes, taverns, take out facilities, institutional food service facilities (e.g., schools, extended care, nursing homes, etc.), supermarkets, day care facilities where meals for more than six children are prepared, and similar facilities by whatever name called.
Georgia FOG alliance means the nonprofit organization (see http://www.georgiafog.com/) established by and for peers participating in FOG programs, as a resource for information, education, and networking for any user, designee or governing authority of a municipality or county with a FOG program. The website also offers tools for commercial waste transporters to operate within the laws of the state.
Pretreatment coordinator means the person designated by the city to be responsible for monitoring what is discharged by a user into the city's wastewater collection system, for ensuring that what is received can be treated or removed at the city's treatment plant, and for ensuring user compliance with the city's ordinances and federal, state, and/or local rules and laws.
Sampling port means the last point downstream of a FOG trap or interceptor that will allow effluent sampling to take place, prior to its mixing with sanitary flows from the establishment.
Tank truck means any vehicle that removes and transports commercial wastes.
Transporter means any person or firm which owns or operates one or more waste tank trucks that receive or dispose of commercial wastes in the state.
User means an establishment primarily engaged in any commercial, industrial, institutional, or other nonresidential activity that introduces, contributes, or discharges (or causes or permits the introduction, contribution, or discharge of) wastewater into the city's POTW, including any person or group who introduces, contributes, or discharges wastewater into the city's POTW through any mobile source or temporary source (such as catering/banquet halls).
Waste transporter permit means the written authorization granted by the city for an individual tank truck that receives or disposes of commercial wastes in the state.
Wastewater means any substance introduced, contributed, or discharged into the city's POTW.
Wastewater discharge permit means the written authorization granted by the city for the user to discharge into the city's POTW, with the user's agreement to comply with the city's ordinances and federal, state, and/or local rules and laws. The permit is valid for up to two years and is nontransferable.

Subdivision IV. - FOG Traps

Sec. 38-555. - FOG trap and interceptor design requirements.
All food service and processing establishments discharging FOG to the city's POTW shall install FOG traps and/or interceptors necessary to achieve and maintain compliance with the following:
(1)
The FOG traps or interceptors shall be installed on a separate building sewer line servicing kitchen flows and shall be connected only to those fixtures or drains which would allow FOG to be discharged. This shall include:
a.
Pot sinks;
b.
Pre-rinse sinks;
c.
Any sink into which FOG are likely to be introduced;
d.
Soup kettles or similar devices;
e.
Wok stations;
f.
Floor drains or sinks into which kettles may be drained; and
g.
Any other fixtures or drains that are likely to allow FOG to be discharged.
(2)
No fixture or drain other than those listed above shall be directly connected to the FOG traps or interceptors unless approved by the pretreatment coordinator.
(3)
Except as provided by subsection (4) of this section, the FOG bearing wastewaters generated from a food service or processing establishment shall be treated using an outdoor FOG interceptor. It is effective to keep ongoing pump out costs at a minimum by installing a FOG interceptor with sufficient volume to contain pollutants longer. A larger FOG interceptor that requires fewer pump outs per year can be cost effective for the user. Outdoor FOG interceptors installations shall have the following design features:
a.
A capacity not less than two 1,500 gallons interceptors in series for a total capacity of 3,000 gallons.
b.
Watertight and constructed of pre-cast concrete by city-approved manufacturers of FOG interceptors and installed and tested as per manufacturer recommendations. Proper building ventilation and interceptor design along with gastight manhole covers will prevent odors from escaping the interceptor and allow them to escape through the roof vents. Labels or signs of warnings, hazards, or dangers should be securely attached and readable.
c.
The user shall be responsible for providing reasonable access to the FOG interceptor for convenient inspection and maintenance. No permanent or temporary structures or containers shall be placed directly over the FOG interceptor. FOG interceptors installed in areas subject to traffic shall be designed to accommodate traffic loading.
d.
The following minimum separating distances shall be maintained between the FOG interceptor and the items listed below:
1.
Property line: ten feet.
2.
Building served (no footing drains): 15 feet.
3.
Groundwater intercepting drains, footing drains and storm drainage systems: 25 feet.
4.
Open watercourse: 50 feet.
(4)
Exceptions:
a.
Limited outside space available. The pretreatment coordinator may approve the installation of a single 1,500-gallon FOG interceptor in cases where site conditions prevent the installation of two 1,500-gallon interceptors in series.
b.
Seating capacities of 100 persons or less. The pretreatment coordinator may approve the installation of a single 1,500-gallon FOG interceptor in establishments having a seating capacity of 100 persons or less.
c.
Seating capacities of 20 persons or less. The pretreatment coordinator may approve the installation of a single 750-gallon FOG interceptor in establishments having a seating capacity of 20 persons or less.
d.
Indoor FOG traps. The pretreatment coordinator may approve the installation of indoor FOG traps provided the establishment is not equipped with a dishwasher or a food waste grinder without solids screening. All indoor traps shall be sized, installed, and maintained in accordance with the requirements of The Plumbing and Drainage Institute's Standard PDI-G 101, Testing and Rating Procedure for Type 1 Hydro Mechanical Grease Interceptors with Appendix of Installation and Maintenance, 2007 or latest version (http://www.pdionline.org/publications.htm). The standard includes guidance for sizing indoor FOG traps when the final details of an establishment are not known. The sizing criteria are based on the maximum flow that specific drain line sizes can carry. Solids (e.g., from garbage disposals and pre-rinse stations) must be removed from the waste stream before allowed into an indoor FOG trap.
(5)
Alternative FOG trap technologies. The pretreatment coordinator may approve the use of alternative FOG trap technologies for controlling FOG bearing wastewaters in lieu of the aforementioned indoor FOG trap and interceptor technologies if he determines such a device will satisfy or exceed the criteria specified in section 38-497.
a.
The user shall provide the following information to allow the pretreatment coordinator to evaluate the proposed technology:
1.
A proposal that is specific for the establishment under consideration. The pretreatment coordinator will not consider a general or generic proposal.
2.
Complete information regarding the actual performance criteria and proof of effectiveness in removing FOG for the proposed alternative FOG trap technology, including specifications for maintenance service frequency and other performance related documents as may be required.
3.
The manufacturer's installation and operation manuals.
b.
If approved, the user shall install and maintain such device in accordance with the manufacturer's installation and operation specifications; provided, however, frequency of maintenance shall not be less than as specified in the user's permit.

Sec. 38-556. - Prohibited discharges into FOG traps and interceptors.
The following shall not be discharged into FOG traps and interceptors:
(1)
Wastewater that does not contain FOG and that otherwise does not require FOG removal.
(2)
Wastewater from dishwashing machines or wastewater with temperatures exceeding 140 degrees Fahrenheit. FOG will initially dissolve, but the FOG can re-congeal and cause blockages further downstream, as the wastewater cools.
(3)
Discharge from food waste grinders or garbage disposals without solids screening first. Ground food takes up volume in FOG traps and interceptors, resulting in increased cleaning frequency and can cause worse problems with blockages.
(4)
Sanitary waste.
(5)
Caustics, acids, solvents, other chemicals, emulsifiers, and enzymes. Some of these additives may break up FOG only to have FOG re-congeal and cause blockages further downstream. Caustics, acids, and solvents are harmful to the biological processes at the treatment plant and employees working on the wastewater collection system.
(6)
Animal entrails or tissues, bones, or feathers.
(7)
Biological agents for FOG remediation or FOG interceptor maintenance without permission from the pretreatment coordinator. Biological agents may be harmful to the biological processes at the treatment plant of the POTW.
(8)
Waste cooking oil. All waste cooking (fryer) oils shall be collected and stored properly in receptacles such as barrels or drums for recycling or other methods of disposal acceptable to the city.
(Code 1993, pt. II, § 90-349; Ord. No. 062608(1) , § 4, 6-26-2008)
Sec. 38-557. - Maintenance, recordkeeping, and inspection.
(a)
FOG traps and interceptors shall be cleaned as often as necessary, at the user's expense, to ensure that sediment, FOG, and other floating materials do not accumulate to impair the efficiency of the FOG trap and/or interceptor and to ensure the establishment's wastewater discharges are in compliance with the criteria in section 38-497. The effectiveness of each FOG trap and interceptor is directly related to the amount of FOG it receives, the maximum flow rate through it, and the cleaning frequency.
(b)
An outdoor FOG interceptor shall be completely cleaned a minimum of every 90 days, or more frequently when:
(1)
25 percent or more of the total wetted height of the FOG interceptor, as measured from the bottom of the device to the invert of the outlet pipe, contains FOG, sludge, solids, and other floating materials;
(2)
The wastewater discharged from the FOG interceptor to the POTW is not in compliance with the criteria in section 38-497; or
(3)
The pretreatment coordinator deems it necessary to require a specific schedule.
(c)
Indoor FOG traps and under-the-counter type FOG traps shall be cleaned at least once on days the establishment is operating until the optimum cleaning frequency is established by the user and agreed upon by the pretreatment coordinator. Recovered FOG must be disposed of properly.
(d)
An authorized representative of the establishment may submit to the pretreatment coordinator a request in writing for an exception to minimum required cleaning frequency of its FOG traps and/or interceptors. The pretreatment coordinator may grant an extension of the required cleaning frequency on a case-by-case basis when:
(1)
The establishment has demonstrated that, between cleanings, the specific FOG trap and/or interceptor will produce an effluent, based on defensible analytical results, in consistent compliance with the city's ordinances and federal, state, and/or local rules and laws;
(2)
Between cleanings, less than 25 percent of the total wetted height of the FOG interceptor, as measured from the bottom of the device to the invert of the outlet pipe, contains floating materials, sediments, or FOG; and
(3)
A consistent rate of FOG accumulation can be established for the establishment.
(e)
A FOG trap or interceptor shall be fully evacuated, cleaned, and inspected by the user at least once per year. FOG interceptor cleaning shall include scraping excessive solids from the wall, floors, baffles, and all piping. The user shall ensure that all fittings and fixtures inside the FOG interceptor are in good condition and functioning properly after the FOG interceptor is pumped out.
(f)
The user shall retain detailed records on-site (which are subject to review by the pretreatment coordinator) reflecting all monitoring and maintenance carried out for each FOG trap and interceptor for a minimum of three years. At a minimum, such records shall contain the following information: date and time of pump out/cleaning service, name of the person doing the service, measured depths of FOG and solids inside the FOG interceptor, deficiencies, and a receipt reflecting all services rendered by waste haulers, including removal of waste cooking oil. The user shall make these records available to the pretreatment coordinator or his designee upon request. These records may be used by the user or the pretreatment coordinator to evaluate the required maintenance frequency of the FOG trap and/or interceptor. Materials collected in the FOG trap and interceptor or waste cooking oil receptacle shall not be introduced or discharged into the city's POTW or stormwater sewer system. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials must be performed by a currently licensed waste transporter.
(g)
The user shall also require the commercial waste transporter to indicate on a manifest each collection made from the user. The state's standardized manifest form must be used (provided by Georgia FOG Alliance at http://www.georgiafog.com/formsandfiles.htm). A manifest is considered complete after the waste is delivered and disposed of at the waste disposal or processing facility and the manifest has been signed and completed by the disposal or processing facility. Users shall sign complete manifests and maintain such records on site for a period of three years for inspection by the pretreatment coordinator.
(h)
The user shall document employee training and obtain employee signatures indicating each employee's attendance and understanding of the establishment's FOG management procedures, such as best management practices and FOG trap and/or interceptor operations and maintenance requirements. Training records shall be available for review by the pretreatment coordinator and/or his designee upon request.
(i)
Users shall supply:
(1)
An adequate sampling port downstream of the FOG trap and/or interceptor, prior to its effluent mixing with other sanitary flows from the establishment; and
(2)
An accessible entry into each chamber of the FOG interceptor.
The minimum requirement for the sampling port of a FOG interceptor shall be a four-inch vertical clean-out. The city may require that a user monitor and test its discharges for FOG in accordance to a sampling schedule and with such methods as are specified in the user's wastewater discharge permit. All monitoring results shall be submitted to the city in accordance to the requirements of the user's wastewater discharge permit.

The user shall allow, upon the presentation of credentials, the pretreatment coordinator or his designee to enter the user's premises, without prior notice and at reasonable times, to inspect FOG traps and/or interceptors, witness the implementation of best management practices, sample any discharge, and to access and copy any records required to be kept under the conditions of this division. Inspections of FOG traps and/or interceptors shall be performed at frequencies determined to be necessary by the pretreatment coordinator to ensure protection of state waters, public health, and the city's POTW. Inspections will be pursuant to division 4, subdivision VIII of this article.

Subdivision V. - Additional Provisions

Sec. 38-580. - Requirements of transporters.
Users shall ensure that all waste material removed from FOG traps and interceptors is disposed of in a manner that complies with all federal, state, and local statutes, rules, regulations, policies and ordinances. Users that contract for the removal of the FOG and other materials collected from the FOG trap or interceptor shall have the contract available on site for inspection by the pretreatment coordinator. The user shall require the contractor to complete a form provided by the city indicating the ultimate disposal destination of the FOG collected or whether the FOG is being reprocessed or rendered.
(1)
Conflicting regulations. In the event this section is in conflict with chapter 391-3-6-.24 (regulation of commercial waste originators, pumpers, transporters, processors, and disposal facilities) of the rules and regulations of the state EPD, the more stringent requirement shall prevail.
(2)
Waste transporters permits requirements. Users shall not allow a contractor without a current waste transporter permit issued by the city to remove waste from their facilities. A permit shall be required of each individual tank truck owned and operated by a person or firm. No city permit shall be issued if the owner of the tank truck is not registered with EPD and has not obtained a complete registration number from EDP. A complete registration number is obtained only after the tank trucks pass inspection. This registration number shall be on display on each tank truck operating in the city and shall be part of the permit number issued by the city.
(3)
EPD approved and inspected waste transporters. To assist in the management of FOG, Georgia FOG Alliance (http://www.georgiafog.com/) maintains an updated list of commercial waste transporters registered with EPD. Commercial waste transporters must register with EPD every two years.
(4)
Manifest requirements. The transporter shall:
a.
Use a manifest for each FOG trap and interceptor being serviced.
b.
Sign the transporter portion of the manifest and leave a copy of the manifest with the owner or user of the FOG trap and/or interceptor.
c.
Present the manifest to the disposal operator to complete and sign the disposal section, and shall leave one copy of the manifest with the disposal site operator.
d.
Send a completed copy of the manifest to the owner or user of the FOG trap and/or interceptor with the signature of the disposal site operator within 30 days.
e.
Keep one copy of the completed manifest form demonstrating delivery to the disposal site operator for their records and shall maintain such records for a period of three years; except that the transporters manifest (or copy thereof) covering not less than the immediately preceding a 30-day period for a particular tank truck shall be kept in the transporter's tank truck. All such records shall be available for inspection.
f.
Ensure that the manifest contains all the information required on the state's standardized manifest form.
g.
A transporter must remove the entire contents of any tank truck and dispose of such contents, unmingled with hazardous wastes or septic wastes, only at a facility authorized to receive such waste.
h.
A transporter shall provide a copy of the waste transporter permit for the tank truck to each disposal site where the transporter disposes of commercial wastes.
i.
A processing or disposal facility of commercial waste shall maintain copies of all manifests of tank pumping at their principal place of business for a period of three years and make such records available for inspection.

Sec. 38-581. - Best management practices.
(a)
Best management practices shall be used to ensure the efficiencies of the FOG traps and interceptors are not impaired and cleaning frequencies can be minimized, thereby reducing maintenance costs. Examples of best management practices:
(1)
Provide training and refresher training to kitchen staff and other employees on how they can help ensure best management practices are implemented.
(2)
Post "No Grease" signs above sinks and on the front of dishwashers.
(3)
Recycle waste cooking oil. Yellow grease has reuse value and should be properly placed, without spilling, in a secured and covered receptacle, such as a barrel or drum. Contract a rendering service to haul yellow grease off-site for beneficial reuse.
(4)
Use water temperatures less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit in all sinks, especially in the pre-rinse sink before the mechanical dishwasher.
(5)
"Dry wipe off" FOG from pots, pans, dishware, food preparation surfaces, and work areas prior to washing. Use absorption products to clean under fryer baskets and other locations where grease may be spilled or dripped.
(6)
Maintain kitchen exhaust filters by cleaning as frequently as necessary to keep filters in good operating condition. If FOG escapes through the exhaust system, it can accumulate on the roof of the establishment and enter the storm sewers during rain or become a fire hazard.
(7)
Dispose of food waste by recycling and/or solid waste removal to reduce the amount washed down the drain. Use sink and floor drain screens to prevent solids from entering drain pipes and FOG traps and interceptors. Food particles take up volume in FOG traps and interceptors, resulting in increased pump out frequency.
(8)
Keep the FOG traps and interceptors free of inorganic solids such as grit, towels, gloves, cigarettes, eating utensils, straws, etc., which could clog or settle in the FOG trap and interceptor, thereby reducing the effective volume or capacity of the FOG trap and interceptor.
(9)
Observe the contract cleaning of FOG interceptors to ensure full removal of interceptor contents. Haulers may take shortcuts and only partially remove contents.
(b)
Additional information on best management practices and reference materials may be obtained from the pretreatment coordinator.
