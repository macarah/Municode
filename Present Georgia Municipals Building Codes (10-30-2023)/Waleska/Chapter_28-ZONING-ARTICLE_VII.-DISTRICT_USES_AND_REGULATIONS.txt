ARTICLE VII. - DISTRICT USES AND REGULATIONS

Sec. 28-154. - Purpose.
(a)
Estate residential district (R-80). The purpose of this district is to permit residential development in those areas that are expected to become more nearly urban in character. The areas involved are generally in transition from agricultural to residential development and are considered appropriate for low density residential development.
(b)
Single-family residential districts (R-40, R-30). The purpose of these residential districts is to enable residential development of a low density urban character. The regulations are designed to permit and encourage residential development in areas where urbanization is taking place.
(c)
Office/institutional district (OI). The purpose of this district is to provide a location for office, institutional, medical, and educational development. Limited related retail business and service activities may be permitted but not involved with storage and processing.
(d)
Neighborhood commercial district (NC). The purpose of this district is to provide for limited retail activities, commercial sales, personal services, and professional offices to serve the general need of a residential neighborhood. Development of commercial uses is regulated for compatibility with the surrounding residential areas. Districts are located to create commercial centers or clusters and to discourage commercial strip development.
(e)
General commercial—Limited use district (GC-LU). The purpose of this district is to provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for a wide variety of commercial sales and service activities which generally serve a wide area. The permitted uses are generally located along the major thoroughfares. Activities with limited storage may be permitted. Districts are located to create centers or concentrations of commercial activities and to discourage commercial strip development.

(1)
Individual lot not meeting minimum lot size requirements. Except as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, in any zoning district in which one-family dwellings are permitted, any lot of record existing at the time of adoption or amendment to the ordinance from which this chapter is derived which has an area, width, or depth less than that required by this chapter may be used as a building site for a one-family dwelling.
(2)
In the case of such a lot, when it is not possible to provide the required side yards and at the same time build a minimum width one-family dwelling, the zoning board of appeals is hereby authorized to grant a variance reducing the side yard requirements for such lot the minimum amount necessary for a reasonable dwelling, but in no case shall each of the side yards be less than five feet in width.
(b)
Lot area. No lot shall be reduced in size so that lot width or depth, size of yards, lot area per family or any other requirement of this chapter is not maintained. This limitation shall not apply:

To rental units in a hotel, motel, motor lodge, tourist home or to rooms in a roominghouse or boardinghouse.
(c)
Corner lots. The minimum yard requirements for corner lots with multiple road frontage shall not be less than the minimum front yard requirements for such lots as specified for each district. Such yards shall be classified as required front yards.
(d)
Through lots. On lots having frontage on two streets, but not located on a corner, the minimum front yard shall be provided on each street in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(e)
Double frontage corner lot. On lots having frontage on more than two streets, the minimum front yard shall be provided in accordance with the regulations set forth in this chapter on at least two of the street frontages. The minimum front yard on the other frontage or frontages may be reduced along the other streets in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.
(f)
Density. No building or structure shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed or altered to:
(1)
House a greater number of families per acre or occupy a smaller lot area per family than are herein required.
(2)

No part of a yard or the off-street parking or loading spaces that are required in connection with any building or use for the purpose of complying with the regulations of this chapter shall be included as part of the yard or off-street parking or loading spaces required for another building, except as specifically provided herein.
(2)
Whenever a lot abuts upon a public alley, one-half of the alley width may be considered as a portion of the required yard.
(3)
Where these regulations refer to side streets, the zoning administrator shall be guided by the pattern of development in the vicinity of the lot in question in determining which of two streets is the side street.
(4)
Every part of a required yard (except rear yards) shall be open to the sky, except as authorized by this article, and excepting ordinary projections of sills, belt courses, window air conditioning units, chimneys, cornices and ornamental features which may project to a distance not to exceed 24 inches into a required yard.
(h)
Front yards.
(1)

(2)
Platforms or paved terraces, not covered by a roof or canopy and which do not extend above the level of the first floor of the building, may extend or project into the front or side yard not more than six feet. Unenclosed porches shall be considered part of the main structure.
(3)
Within the same block and zoning district, when 25 percent or more of the existing buildings which are located within 200 feet of each side of a lot have less than the minimum required setback, the setback of such lot should not exceed the average of the existing setbacks.
(i)
Side yards.
(1)
For the purpose of the side yard regulations, a group of business or commercial building separated by common or party walls shall be considered as one building occupying one lot.
(2)
The minimum width of side yards for schools, libraries, churches, community houses and other public and semipublic buildings in residential districts shall be 25 feet, except where a side yard is adjacent to a business or commercial district, in which case the width of that yard shall be required in Table 28-154 for the district in which the building is located.
(j)
Rear yards. Open or lattice-enclosed fire escapes, outside stairways, balconies opening up on fire towers and the ordinary projections of chimneys and flues, may project into the required rear yard for a distance of not more than five feet, but only where the same are so placed as not to obstruct light and ventilation.

(d)
General site development and design regulations for commercial districts.
(1)
Purpose and intent. Careful attention to attractive and citizen-friendly community design is in the economic interests of the city, its citizens, and business owners. Attractive and integrated community design features tend to improve the city's image, raise overall property values, attract new businesses, and improve the quality of life. Investment in design features tends to result in a positive return on investment for property owners, private industry, and government. For example, the money spent on landscaped roadway medians, sidewalks, and street trees is likely to be amply returned in the form of increased tax revenue resulting from the overall increase in property values that accompanies attractive and desirable urban and suburban areas.
a.
Much of the existing commercial development, particularly development along the city's principal highways, is in need of aesthetic and functional enhancement. Existing conditions that are inconsistent with the objectives of quality community design include: chainlink fencing enclosures of autos and trailers without adequate screening; various building materials and/or equipment stored in front yards in view of the traveling public; continuous, uncurbed, highway access; old, dilapidated, and/or unattractive awnings and facade treatments; excessive signage in the form of fluttering ribbons, portable signs, sandwich signs, and welcome flags; a lack of front yard landscaping; storage/maintenance bay doors and loading areas facing the highway; dumpsters placed in front/side yards in unobstructed view from highways; and a general lack of interparcel access (i.e., connections between adjacent developments).
b.
It is the intent of the city to require new commercial developments, install appropriate improvements and comply with general design regulations intended to improve aesthetic appearance and function. It is also the intent of the city to require substantial progress toward compliance with these improvement requirements and general design regulations in cases where existing businesses are expanded.
c.
These design regulations are intended to merge traffic engineering, civil engineering, urban design, landscape architecture, and land use planning principles into a set of regulations for commercial developments and properties. The regulations are the minimum necessary to: preserve the carrying capacity of major arteries; reduce the number of vehicular turning movements to and from the major artery, thereby reducing the potential for automobile and pedestrian traffic accidents; encourage and promote the most suitable uses of land; ensure the adequate grading and draining of developments; promote an environment which reduces the visual clutter and other distracting characteristics resulting from various aspects typical of urban and suburban commercial strip development; prohibit the needless, wasteful and purposeless aesthetic degradation of the county's highway and major street corridors; and promote a more healthy environment.
(2)
Applicability. This subsection (d) of this section shall apply to all properties located within commercial (GC-LU, NC, and OI) zoning districts. New development shall be required to conform to these regulations. A substantial improvement of an existing development shall be required to conform to these regulations or, in cases where physically impossible, make substantial progress toward meeting the regulations contained within this chapter. The term "substantial improvement" shall be defined as increasing the floorspace dedicated to commercial/industrial operations by more than 50 percent, the addition of a new or increase of an open storage area by more than 30 percent of the existing area.
(3)
Site requirements. The following requirements are applicable to the development of all commercial and industrial sites or properties:
a.
Utilities. All utilities, including but not limited to electric and telephone lines, serving uses on site should be installed underground where appropriate and permissible.
b.
Grading and site development. Buildings and parking lots shall be appropriately drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties or public streets. Grading plans for new development shall be submitted to the county engineer for review and approval, and all grading activities shall comply with approved plans. Stormwater management plans shall be submitted to the county engineer for review and approval. All disturbed or graded ground areas of a building site not used for buildings or open storage areas shall be appropriately stabilized and grassed or covered with plants or landscaping materials.
c.
Screening of outside storage yards. All areas devoted to the outside storage of vehicles, merchandise, and/or equipment not intended for display for public rent, lease, or sale shall be screened from view from the right-of-way of the highway or major street along the entire property frontage, except in areas where access crossings have been approved. Screening may be accomplished by a vegetative buffer either planted or undisturbed or a combination of both, by a building that meets architectural standards of this chapter, by use of landscape material, either planted or existing, by an earthen berm, by a 70 percent opaque, wooden fence or wall, or combination of these screening methods. The use of low-lying landscaping that does not screen the display areas from view from the public right-of-way shall not be deemed to comply with this requirement.
d.
Outdoor lighting. All outdoor lighting installed shall be of such height, location and intensity so that direct illumination of the right-of-way of the highway or major street is avoided. The installation of shields or hoods on such lighting facilities may be required to comply with this standard. All lighting shall comply with article XXII.
e.
Landscaping. Every building site and commercial use area shall be landscaped. A minimum ten-foot-wide landscape strip shall be installed and maintained along the entire property fronting the highway or major street, except in cases where access areas are approved. A minimum six-foot-wide landscape strip shall be required along all side and rear lot or lease lines, except in cases where shared driveways or access areas are approved. The area surrounding the road entrances to the site or area, the front landscape strip, required parking lot landscaping, and all other required landscape and/or open spaces, shall be designed, installed, and maintained according to plans prepared by a professional landscape architect, architect, surveyor, engineer, or land planner submitted to and approved by the city. Landscaping shall be completed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, unless appropriate provisions are made to guarantee the installation of landscaping after such certificate is issued, such as approval by the county of a bond for landscaping.
f.
Location of parking areas. Parking areas shall be set back at least ten feet from public rights-of-way. Parking areas are encouraged but not required to be located in side and rear yards where such parking areas can be partially or wholly screened by buildings from the public right-of-way. The ten-foot strip between the public road and the edge of the parking area shall be landscaped with evergreen vegetation capable of reaching a height of three feet and/or able to withstand pruning to a height of three feet. The purpose of the vegetation is to reduce the visual impact of the parked vehicles by screening from public view the parking area.
g.
Open display of vehicles, equipment, and merchandise. In commercial zoning districts where permitted, the outside storage or display of vehicles, equipment, and merchandise to be rented, leased, or sold shall be visible along no more than 50 percent of the frontage of the property abutting the highway or major street, excluding approved driveway entrances and exits. Screening may be accomplished by:
1.
A natural and/or planted vegetative buffer;
2.
A building that meets architectural standards of this chapter;
3.
Use of landscape material, either planted or existing;
4.
An earthen berm;
5.
A 70 percent opaque, solid wooden fence or wall, or combination of these screening methods.
The use of low-lying landscaping that does not screen the display areas from view from the public right-of-way shall not be deemed to comply with this requirement.
h.
Plans. Site development as-built drawings, containing a boundary survey, location, elevation, height, and square footage of buildings, parking areas, utilities, walls, and stormwater facilities, pertinent site development data, and any other requirements of the planning director or county engineer shall be submitted to and approved by the department prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or completion.
i.
Commercial building requirements. The following requirements are applicable to all commercial buildings:
1.
Screening of dumpsters. All garbage dumpsters and other similar areas devoted to the storage of waste materials shall be screened on three sides of said dumpster or area with a minimum six-foot-high solid wooden fence, or a wall constructed of materials substantially similar in appearance to the building on site that complies with the architectural requirements of these regulations. In addition, said dumpster areas shall be gated on the fourth side, and the gate shall be architecturally finished.
2.
Building materials. Building exteriors not screened (50 percent opaque) from view from the right-of-way shall have an architectural treatment of brick, stone, split face blocks, painted/stained wood, architectural metal, vinyl, stucco, or imitations of the same or other architectural treatments approved by the planning director. Prohibited building materials are:
(i)
*Industrial or agricultural metal sheeting.
(ii)
*Standard painted or unpainted concrete block.
(iii)
Any awnings shall be maintained in good order, and any dilapidated awnings or canopies shall be removed.
*These finishes are allowed on the side or rear of buildings if a minimum of 50 percent opaque from thoroughfare row.
3.
Building and utility appurtenances. All water towers, cooling towers, storage tanks, and other structures or equipment incidental to the primary use of a building or site shall be architecturally compatible with the principal building or effectively screened from view from the public rights-of-way. All rooftop mechanical equipment shall be screened from the view from the public right-of-way and adjacent streets by material compatible with the building architecture, by the use of a parapet wall, or by specially designed rooftop penthouse enclosures. Ground-mounted equipment such as power transformers and air-conditioning units shall be screened from view from public rights-of-way by fencing or landscaping, or painted to match the primary building.
4.
Signage. All freestanding signs in commercial districts shall be of monument style, have a base of masonry construction, or if the sign consists of columns instead of a base, said columns shall be constructed of materials to match or compliment the principal structure or structures located on the site. All such signs shall be considered freestanding for purposes of allowable sign area and height requirements according to article X of this chapter and shall be constructed in compliance with same.
5.
Rooflines on commercial buildings.
(i)
All buildings in commercial building districts shall have a pitched roof with a minimum pitch of 4.5 inches vertical elevation per one foot of horizontal distance, except as provided herein.
(ii)
Commercial buildings without a pitched roof shall have a detailed parapet and cornice in keeping with the overall architectural style of the building.
(iii)
Exposed roofing (defined as having a pitch greater than 1:12) shall be finished in architectural metal or synthetic panels, or dimensional shingles.
6.
Building arrangement and architectural consistency. When commercial buildings are developed as a planned center, all buildings located within the center shall be constructed such that the architectural styles, building materials and roof materials are similar. Additionally, color schemes for the outside of the buildings should be similar such that the center or park presents a consistent style of architecture and architectural treatments.
j.
Access requirements. The following development requirements are applicable to all commercial sites or properties:
1.
Curb cuts and access specifications.
(i)
All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any state highway shall be approved by the state department of transportation and the county engineer, prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any development permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or exits.
(ii)
No curb cut or access driveway shall be permitted to be located closer than 100 feet to the nearest existing or proposed right-of-way of an intersecting roadway or closer than 40 feet to a side property line, unless the adjacent property owner is in agreement with the encroachment of the driveway and approval is obtained from the county engineer. Curb cuts or access driveways shall be no narrower than 24 feet from back of curb to back of curb. Strict adherence to these requirements may not be practical in all instances as determined by the county engineer. The county engineer may limit the maximum width of a curb cut and/or the number of curb cuts to a parcel as necessary when it is deemed to be of benefit to the safety and welfare of the public.
(iii)
In cases of a substantial improvement of an existing development on a site that does not meet these curb cut and access specifications, the applicant may be required by the county engineer to prepare an access plan as part of plans for the substantial improvement that either meets these requirements or moves substantially toward compliance with these regulations. Approval by the state department of transportation and the county engineer shall be required, as applicable.
(iv)
Additional rights-of-way shall be dedicated to the public as required by the most current functional classification of county roads as designated by the county engineer, and as reasonable at the discretion of the county engineer. Roadway entrances and improvements, including necessary deceleration lanes and right/left turn lanes, shall be designed, installed, and maintained as approved by the state department of transportation, as applicable, or the county engineer, in accordance with state or county requirements, as applicable and as may be amended from time to time.
(v)
The following factors may be considered during the review and approval of a specific location of an entrance:
i.
The location of existing or planned median breaks;
ii.
Separation requirements between the entrance and major intersections;
iii.
Separation requirements between other entrances;
iv.
The need to provide shared access with other sites;
v.
The need to align with previously approved or constructed access points on the opposite side of the street; and
vi.
The minimum number of entrances needed to move traffic onto and off the site safely and efficiently.
2.
Interparcel connections. New commercial development containing, or that is intended to contain, more than one building or use on site shall provide connections so that automobile trips between and among such buildings or uses can be accomplished without using the adjacent highways or major streets. Joint or shared drives are encouraged. Where possible and practical, new developments and substantial improvements to existing developments shall provide for pedestrian and automobile access connections between adjacent properties under different ownership when the uses of the properties are of such compatibility that patrons may frequent both buildings or uses in the same vehicle trip.
3.
Location of loading and unloading areas. All areas and facilities devoted to the loading and unloading of goods and merchandise shall be located to the side or rear of the building and lot.

Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this regulation is derived shall not be required to meet the requirements of this regulation, other than the requirements of subsection (25)b5, 6 of this section. Any such towers or antennas shall be referred to in this regulation as preexisting towers or preexisting antennas.
b.
General guidelines and requirements.
1.
Purpose and goals. The purpose of this regulation is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this regulation are to:
(i)
Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
(ii)
Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
(iii)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
(iv)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and
(v)
Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently.
2.
Principal or accessory use. Towers and antennas may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire parcel of land shall control, even though the tower or antenna may be located on leased parcels within said parcel of land. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
3.
Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna or tower shall provide to the planning and zoning department an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the city or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The planning and zoning department may share such information with other applicants applying for approval under this section or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the county, provided, however that the planning and zoning department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such site areas are available or suitable.
4.
Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this subsection shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas governed by this section; provided, however, that the city council may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this section are better served thereby.
(i)
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(ii)
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(iii)
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(iv)
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the city council may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
5.
Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the antennas and towers governed by this section shall bring such antennas and towers into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the antenna or tower at the owners' expense. Any such removal by the city council shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17.
6.
Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the city council concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the city council may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the city council shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17.

In cases of hardship, where a temporary use permit is granted by the mayor and council, such use is limited to a period not to exceed six months without specific written approval of the mayor and council, who may require new evidence of the conditions upon which hardship was based. Prior to the issuance of a temporary use permit based upon hardship, the applicant must execute a statement that he or she acknowledges and agrees that the permit is valid only so long as the conditions of the permit are met, that upon the termination of any of the conditions, the applicant shall cause the removal of the mobile or manufactured home at his own expense and that failure to do so grants to the city the right to remove the same from the premises at the expense of the applicant, manufactured home owner, and/or the owner of the real estate.
m.
In all residential zoning districts, a manufactured home may be placed on a site temporarily for six months for residential purposes while a site-built home is constructed. Only one six-month extension shall be allowed. The applicant/property owner shall sign an acknowledgement letter authorizing the city to stop the provision of utilities to the manufactured home at the end of the approved time limit for this temporary placement of a manufactured home.
