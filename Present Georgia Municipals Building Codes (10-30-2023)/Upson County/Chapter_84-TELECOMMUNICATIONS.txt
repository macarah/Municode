Sec. 84-23. - Applicability.
modified
(a)
Height limitations shall be those indicated in each zoning district and as those standards may be further described by this article.
(b)
County property. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the county shall be exempt from the requirements of this article, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the board.
(c)
Exceptions for amateur radio and receive-only antennas. This article shall govern towers and antennas owned and operated by federally licensed amateur radio station operators, except where specifically exempted. Additionally, this article shall not govern satellite dishes or other receive-only antennas used exclusively for television reception purposes.
(d)
Pre-existing antennas and towers. Any tower or antenna for which a building permit has been properly issued, prior to the effective date of this article, shall not be required to meet the requirements of this article, other than the requirements of subsections (d) and (e) of section 84-24. Any such antenna or tower shall be referred to in this article as a "pre-existing tower".
(e)
Temporary towers and antennas. Antennas or towers to be temporarily located on property for a period not exceeding 60 days shall not require a special exception permit. Provided, however, these temporary antennas or towers shall meet all other requirements of this article, in addition to the following conditions:
(1)

(Ord. No. 158, § 3, 9-26-2002; Ord. No. 273 , § 1, 3-9-2021)
Sec. 84-24. - Guidelines and requirements.
modified
(a)
Permitting. Regardless of height, regardless of commercial or non-commercial use, all telecommunications towers, support structures and antennas, as defined and regulated herein, must have an Upson County building permit applied for and issued prior to construction.
(b)
Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either a principal or accessory use if so designated in the Upson County Zoning Ordinance. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same parcel of land shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such parcel. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district regulations, including, but not limited to, setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire parcel shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased property within such parcel. Antennas that are installed and towers that are constructed in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
(c)
Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for a building permit to install or construct an antenna and/or tower (except federally licensed amateur radio station operators) shall provide to the department an inventory of its existing antennas and towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the county or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each antenna and tower. The department may share such information with other applicants applying for special exception permits under this article, or other organizations seeking to locate antennas and/or towers within the jurisdiction of the county.
(d)
Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this section shall control the installation of all antennas and the location of all towers governed by this article, including those of federally licensed amateur radio station operators. Provided, however, that the board may waive or vary the terms of these requirements if it determines that the goals of this article are better served thereby.
(1)
Towers shall be constructed and maintained with either a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness;
(2)
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment;
(3)
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment shall be of neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structures so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible; and
(4)
Antennas and towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable governmental authority. If lighting is required, the department may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
(e)
Federal requirements. All antennas and towers shall meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate antennas and towers. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owners of the antennas and towers governed by this article shall bring such antennas and towers into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations. Provided, however, if a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency, the owners of the antennas and towers shall be required to comply with the more stringent compliance schedule. Failure to bring antennas and towers into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the antennas or towers by the department at the owner's expense. Any such removal caused by the department shall be in the manner in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17.
(f)
Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of all antennas and towers, all owners of pre-existing antennas and towers, and owners of antennas and towers governed by this article, shall ensure that they are maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable county building codes and the applicable standards for antennas and towers that are published by the electronic industries association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the department concludes that any antenna and/or tower fails to comply with such codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon notice being provided to the owner of the antenna or tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such antenna or tower into compliance with such codes and standards. If the owner fails to bring such antenna or tower into compliance within said 30 days, the department may cause the removal of such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the department shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17.

Sec. 84-25. - Special exception permits required.
modified
(a)
General. The installation of antennas and towers within the county may require a special exception permit as determined under each zoning district. The following provisions shall govern the application and consideration for granting special exception permits.
(1)
Special exception permits shall be applied for and considered in accordance with the zoning ordinance of Upson County, Georgia;
(2)
In considering a special exception permit, the board may impose conditions to the extent the board concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect the proposed antenna or tower may have on adjoining properties; and
(3)
Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer. A written manufacturer's and/or professional structural engineer certification shall be submitted stating that the antenna support structure has been designed in compliance with the minimum design loads prescribed in the current edition of the State of Georgia adopted standard building code.
(b)
Information required. Each applicant requesting a special exception permit under this article shall submit a scaled site plan, elevation view, and other supporting drawings, calculations, and documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements. Additionally, information may be required by the board concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and any other information deemed by the board to be necessary to assess compliance with this article.
(c)
Factors considered in granting special exception permits. The board shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special exception permit. Provided, however, the board may vary any of such factors if the board concludes that the goals of this ordinance are better served thereby.
(1)
Height of the proposed antenna or tower;
(2)
Proximity of the antenna or tower to other structures and zoning district boundaries;
(3)
Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
(4)
Surrounding topography;
(5)
Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
(6)
Design of the antenna or tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
(7)
Availability of suitable existing antennas or towers and other structures;
(8)
Proximity of the antenna or tower to other antennas or towers; and
(9)
Such other additional standards of review as are set forth in the zoning ordinance of Upson County, Georgia as amended.
(d)
Availability of suitable existing antennas, towers, or other structures (amateur radio station towers and antenna exempt). No new antennas or towers shall be permitted, unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the board that no existing antenna, tower, or structure can accommodate the applicant's purposed antenna or tower. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing antenna, tower, or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna, tower, or structure may consist of any of the following:
(1)
No existing antennas, towers, or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements;
(2)
Existing antennas, towers, or structures are not designed to meet applicant's engineering requirements;
(3)
Existing antennas, towers, or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment;
(4)
The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna;
(5)
The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure, or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing, are unreasonable. Cost exceeding new tower development are presumed for purposes of this paragraph to be unreasonable;
(6)
Property owners or owners of existing towers or structures are unwilling to reasonably accommodate the applicant's needs; and
(7)
The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
(e)
Setback and separation. The following setback and separation requirements shall apply to all antennas and towers, including those used by federally licensed amateur radio station operators. Provided, however, the board may, in its sole discretion, grant a variance to reduce the standard setback and separation requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby.
(1)
Antennas and towers must be set back a distance greater than or equal to the combined height of the prospective antenna and associated tower from the boundary line of property upon which the tower is located (effectively creating a buffer equal to the height of the antenna or tower); potential future extensions to the equipment should be planned for; and
(2)
Antennas, towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements.
(f)
Security fencing. Antennas and towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. Provided, however, that the board may vary such requirements, as it deems appropriate. (Amateur radio station towers and antenna exempt.)
(g)
Buffers and landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the buffers and landscaping surrounding antennas and towers. Provided, however, that the board may vary such requirements, as it deems appropriate:
(1)
Antenna and tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the antenna or tower compound from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of landscaped strip of at least 25 feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound (amateur radio station towers and antenna exempt);
(2)
Buffer reductions may be allowed when existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on site are preserved to the maximum extent possible. In certain instances where such antennas or towers are located on large wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer; and
(3)
Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible.
(h)
Special exception permits not required. The following uses are specifically permitted without a special exception permit:
(1)
Installing an antenna (excluding a microcell) on an existing alternative tower structure, or structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower, or similar freestanding nonresidential structure), that is 50 feet in height or greater, so long as the additional antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the existing structure;
(2)
Installing a microcell on an existing alternative tower structure, or nonresidential structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign light pole, water tower, or similar freestanding structure), so long as the microcell adds no more than six feet to the height of the existing structures; and
(3)
Installing an antenna on any existing tower or other structure of any height, so long as the addition of the antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the existing tower and the setback from all property lines remain equal to or greater than the total height of the tower plus the new antenna. This exemption is one time only. Such specific permitted use shall also include the placement of any additional building or other supporting equipment used in connection with the antenna. Provided, however, the additional building shall be consistent in type of exterior material and quality of design and construction with any other building constructed upon the premises. The criteria relative to consistency with an existing building and to which existing building, if more than one building previously exists, shall be within the sole discretion of the department.
(i)
Removal of abandoned antennas, towers, or structures. Any antenna, tower or structure that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and such antenna, tower or structure shall be removed within 90 days of receipt of notice from the department notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna, tower or structure is not removed within 90 days, the department may, in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17, remove such antenna or tower at the owners expense.
