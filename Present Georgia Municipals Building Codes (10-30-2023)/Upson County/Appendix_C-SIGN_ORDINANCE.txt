Appendix C - SIGN ORDINANCE

Section 101. - Title.
This document shall be entitled, "The Upson County Sign Ordinance."
( Ord. No. 253 , ยง 1, 12-13-2016)
Section 102. - Purpose.
The board of county commissioners finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the county's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. Accordingly, it is the intention of the county to establish regulations governing the display of signs which will:
A.
Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
B.
Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the county by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs.
C.
Restrict signs and lights which increase clutter or which increase the probability of traffic accidents by obstructing vision.
D.
Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings.
E.
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
Citizens wishing to communicate messages through signage on residentially-zoned property must abide by reasonable regulations on sign size, height, number, location and other standards. Similar to sign standards for commercial properties, safety and aesthetics are also important in our residential areas.
Various and diverse businesses are located within Upson County. The need to advertise products and services must be balanced by the county's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, and enhance public safety.
Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the county without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and to protect property values therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the county in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies.
It is also the purpose of this ordinance to insure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs.
Many studies have documented the safety, aesthetic and economic impacts of signage, a few which support the purpose of this ordinance include:

A.
Variance procedure.
1.
Application for a variance shall be made to the planning commission secretary. The secretary will take the required information and determine if it is sufficient, i.e., accurate and complete. Once the secretary has determined that the variance application is sufficient, he/she shall transmit it to the planning commission for its consideration.
2.
When a sufficient application for a variance is received, the planning commission secretary must post a sign at least two (2) feet by three (3) feet in size in a conspicuous place on the property, visible from all bordering public streets, at least fifteen (15) days but not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing. The sign must set forth the fact that it is a "variance notice." It must show the date, time, and place of the scheduled public hearing, and it must inform the public that additional information may be obtained from the administrative officer.
3.
When a sufficient application for a variance is received, the planning commission will set a time and place for a public hearing on the variance. Notice of the hearing must be published in the legal organ (newspaper) of Upson County at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. Such notice will state the application number, owner's name, property location, its area, time, place and subject of the hearing. At least fifteen (15) days before the public hearing, notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing will be sent to the appellant or petitioner in writing by U.S. mail to his last known address. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant file for permanent record.
4.
The planning commission shall make a decision concerning the variance and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting.
5.
The variance issued by the planning commission must specify which requirements are to be varied from. It must specify alternative requirements to be met, replacing the requirements varied from.
6.
The planning commission may establish performance bonds to assure compliance with any requirements it has set for granting a variance. Where a variance is granted for a construction activity requiring a building permit, the building permit must be obtained and construction must begin within six (6) months of the issuance of the variance. Otherwise, the variance expires after six (6) months.
7.
The decision of the planning commission on the application for variance may be appealed on points of law to the board of commissioners within ten (10) business days of the planning commission's decision and then, again if not satisfied, to the Superior Court of Upson County, under its fees and procedures.
B.
Sign variance standards. The following standards shall be considering in evaluating an application for variance, from the sign regulations of this ordinance, where not prohibited:
1.
It must be determined that there are unique physical circumstances or conditions peculiar to the particular property, such as, but not limited to irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of the lot size or shape, or an unusual degree or type of development proposed on the property, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions.
2.
That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, signage cannot be erected in strict conformity with the provisions of this appendix without undue hardship to the property owner or business owner; and that granting the variance will not result in authorization of a type of sign not otherwise allowed on the property.
3.
Granting the variance will not cause substantial detriment to the public good.
4.
Variances shall be considered where visibility of a conforming sign from the public street and within fifty (50) feet of the proposed sign would be substantially impaired by existing trees, plants, natural features, signs, existing buildings or structures on a different lot; and where placement of the sign elsewhere on the lot would not remedy the visual obstruction; and where such visibility obstruction was not created by the owner of the subject property; and where the variance proposed would not create a safety hazard to traffic.
5.
Variances shall be limited to the minimum relief necessary to overcome the hardship.
6.
A sign permit must be applied for within twenty-eight (28) calendar days of approval of the variance or the variance shall become null and void.
