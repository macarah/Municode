ARTICLE 4. - GENERAL PROCEDURES

Section 401. - Initial information.
A.
Article 4 outlines the procedures to be followed in order to comply with the requirements of this ordinance. The developer (see definition of "developer" in article 2), who initially may not be familiar with this ordinance, first visits the administrative officer to get information concerning the ordinance affecting his proposed development.
B.
The administrative officer will show the developer a copy of this ordinance. The developer may either review the document in the office or he may purchase a copy for his own use.
Section 402. - Compliance with zoning ordinance required.
A.
No building is to be erected, used, occupied, moved, or altered in a manner that does not conform to the requirements specified for the district in which it is located.
B.
The only exception to this requirement is that all buildings or uses which lawfully existed at a particular location at the time this ordinance was adopted may be continued as "nonconforming uses."
Section 403. - Continuation of nonconforming uses.
Invariably, at the time a land use and development control ordinance is adopted or amended, certain uses which lawfully existed prior to the adoption or amendment will not conform to the regulations and standards for the districts in which they are located. These are known as nonconforming uses, and in order to feasibly adopt the ordinance and so as not to cause undue economic hardship on owners of nonconforming uses, these uses are allowed to continue under special conditions as outlined in the following parts of this section:
A.
Where a nonconforming use of a building or lot has ceased for more than six months or has changed to a permitted or conforming use, further use of the building or lot must be in conformance with the standards and requirements for the district in which it is located.
B.
A nonconforming use shall not be extended or expanded. Any interior or exterior remodeling or other alteration of a nonconforming building or lot that does not have the effect of extending or expanding the nonconforming use must be in conformance with the requirements of this ordinance.
C.
A nonconforming use which undergoes interior or exterior remodeling or other alteration that does not extend or expand the nonconforming use must meet applicable Upson County building codes and development regulations. When an applicant seeks a building permit for such remodeling or other alteration of a nonconforming use, the administrative officer shall inspect the unit and determine what is needed to bring the unit into conformance with applicable building codes and development regulations. Upon determining that the unit meets applicable building codes and development regulations, the administrative officer will issue the building permit for the nonconforming use.
D.
If a nonconforming building or structure suffers damage which does not exceed 50 percent of its fair market value immediately preceding such damage, the building or structure may be reconstructed and reused as before if completed within 12 months from the time such damage occurred. If such damage is greater than 50 percent of its fair market value immediately preceding the damage, such a building or structure may only be reconstructed and used in conformity with the standards and requirements for the district in which it is located. Otherwise, it must be removed at the owner's expense within six months from the time such damage occurred.
E.
A use which is nonconforming only with respect to screening or buffer (see definition in article 2) requirements must provide required screens or buffers within a period of three years from the effective date of this ordinance. This time period is to allow for the growth of natural vegetative buffers.
F.
In addition to the above stated conditions concerning the continuance of nonconforming uses, any business (including a home occupation business) that meets the definition of nonconforming use as specified herein shall at all times maintain a properly obtained and executed Upson County occupational tax certificate (commonly referred to as "business license"). A break of 12 months or more in the purchase and issuance of said occupational tax certificate shall cause the business to lose its status as a nonconforming use, and any further use must be in conformance with the standards and requirements for the district in which it is located.
(Ord. No. 166, 6-24-2004)
Section 404. - Building permit required.
A.
The developer or other person wishing to do any of the following must first apply to the administrative officer for a building permit:
1.
Excavation or filling of a lot for the construction of a building.
2.
Erection, movement, extension, or enlargement of a building.
3.
Work on an existing building which increases the assessed value $500.00 or more.
4.
Installation of a manufactured home or industrialized building.
B.
No electricity, water, or sewage hookup will be made available to the site of new construction until a building permit is secured.
C.
The building permit must be applied for either by the owner of the land upon which the proposed building or alteration is to be located, or by the contractor doing the work.
D.
The applicant may obtain a building permit application from the administrative officer. He should complete the application form and submit it to the administrative officer, together with any supporting documentation which the administrative officer may specify.
E.
No application will be accepted from any person who is in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for a building permit is, at the time of such an application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one of the following:
1.
He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation.
2.
He must be tried before a court of competent jurisdiction and acquitted of charges and present a certified copy of the court order to the administrative officer within 30 days of the final order of the court.
F.
When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by either "1" or "2" above, the administrative officer will then accept the application for building permit.
G.
Before a building permit is issued by the administrative officer, the Upson County Health Department must approve the proposed water supply and sewage disposal facilities required in connection with the proposed building or structure. In areas served by a public water and sewage [sewer] system, the health department may elect to waive the requirement for approval. After study of the site of a proposed use, the health department may require for health reasons that all or any portion of the site not be used for the intended purpose. The health department may also set a minimum lot size larger than that required by this ordinance. The Upson County Health Department will either approve or disapprove the water and sewer facilities within ten days of receipt of the application from the administrative officer, providing a written decision, including reasons for the decision.
H.
An existing use which is altered or extended must meet applicable Upson County building codes and development regulations. When an applicant seeks a building permit for the extension or alteration of an existing use, the administrative officer will inspect the use and determine what (if anything) is needed to bring the use into conformance with applicable building codes and development regulations before a building permit may be issued.
I.
The administrative officer is in charge of issuing building permits. The administrative officer will contact the applicant at the address shown on the application. The building permit will be issued if, upon review of the application and inspection of the site, the administrative officer is satisfied that the proposed project will meet the requirements of this ordinance and all other applicable ordinances. The administrative officer may require the submission of additional information in order to determine if the proposed project meets the requirements of this ordinance.
J.
If the administrative officer determines that the proposed project as presented in the building permit application will not satisfy the requirements of this ordinance, he will not issue a building permit. He will notify the applicant in writing within 14 days of the submission of the application, stating reasons for the refusal. The applicant will then need to confer with the administrative officer to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a building permit.
K.
Construction on an approved project must start within six months from the date of issue of the building permit, or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the project is desired at a future date. If construction has begun on an approved project and then ceases before the project is completed, construction must be restarted within 12 months from the time that it was stopped, or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the project is desired to resume at a future date. Records of building permit applications and supporting materials will be maintained by the administrative officer.
L.
All newly constructed buildings, as well as additions, extensions, or enlargements of structures, must comply with all building codes in effect in Upson County. The administrative officer will explain the procedures and timing of inspections to determine if work meets applicable codes.
Section 404.1. - Inspection of previously inhabited manufactured homes—Minimum health and safety standards.

( Ord. No. 267 , § 1, 2-12-2019)
Section 405. - Certificate of occupancy required.
A.
A certificate of occupancy is required before a structure for which a building permit has been issued may be occupied or used. The building permit becomes the certificate of occupancy when the administrative officer signs it in the appropriate space, certifying that to the best of his knowledge all requirements of this ordinance have been met. The owner/contractor will then receive the certificate of occupancy to be used as confirmation that he has complied with the provisions of this ordinance.
B.
The administrative officer will issue the certificate of occupancy within ten days of receiving the building permit with required certifications, if he finds that all requirements of this ordinance and all other applicable ordinances have been met. However, if he finds that all requirements of such ordinances have not yet been met when the owner/contractor seeks a certificate of occupancy, the administrative officer will not issue the certificate of occupancy. He will notify the owner/contractor within ten days, stating reasons for the refusal. The owner/contractor will then need to confer with the administrative officer to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a certificate of occupancy.
Section 406. - Appealing an action of the administrative officer.
A.
If the administrative officer executes an action which the developer or other aggrieved party believes to be contrary to law, that action may be appealed. Findings of fact, however, may not be appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date on which the action by the administrative officer was taken.
B.
The planning commission has jurisdiction for hearing appeals concerning actions of the administrative officer related to this ordinance. Applications for appeal may be obtained from and submitted to the administrative officer, who will transmit them to the planning commission for its consideration.
C.
When an action of the administrative officer is appealed, all construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action must be stopped immediately. In certain cases, however, the administrative officer may feel that the stopping of such construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action will cause imminent peril to life or property. Then, the administrative officer may certify to the planning commission that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the halting of construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action is allowed to continue unless a restraining order is granted by either the planning commission or a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
D.
When an application for appeal of an action of the administrative officer is received, the planning commission will set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing must be published in the legal organ (newspaper) of Upson County at least 15 days before the hearing. In addition, the parties to the appeal will be notified of the date of the hearing by the planning commission by certified mail with return receipt requested at least 15 days before the hearing. Any person may appear at the hearing, or have a representative attend instead.
E.
The planning commission will make a decision concerning the appeal and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting. Further appeal on points of law may be made to [the] board of commissioners.
Section 406.1. - Appealing an action of the planning commission.
A.
If the planning commission executes an action which the developer or other aggrieved party believes to be contrary to law, that action may be appealed. Findings of fact, however, may not be appealed.

Applications for appeal may be obtained from and submitted to the administrative officer, who will transmit them to the board of commissioners for its consideration.
C.
When an action of the planning commission is appealed, all construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action must be stopped immediately. In certain cases, however, the administrative officer may feel that the stopping of such construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action will cause imminent peril to life or property. Then, the administrative officer may certify to the board of commissioners that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the halting of construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action is allowed to continue unless a restraining order is granted by either the board of commissioners or a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
D.
When an application for appeal of an action of the planning commission is received, the board of commissioners will set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing must be published in the legal organ (newspaper) of Upson County at least 15 days before the hearing. In addition, the parties to the appeal will be notified of the date of the hearing by the board of commissioners by certified mail with return receipt requested at least 15 days before the hearing. Any person may appear at the hearing, or have a representative attend instead.
E.
The board of commissioners will make a decision concerning the appeal and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting. Further appeal on points of law may be made to the Upson County Superior Court.
Section 407. - Variances.
A.
A variance is a permit, issued by the planning commission, which allows use of a parcel of land in a way that does not meet certain requirements for the district in which the property is located. A variance may be granted only in an individual case where an extreme hardship would result if all of the requirements of this ordinance were applied stringently to a particular piece of property. The hardship must be proven by showing beyond a doubt that reasonable use of the land is not possible if all of the requirements of this ordinance are to be met. The hardship cannot be self-created such as:
1.
A lot purchased with knowledge of an existing restriction.
2.
A claim of hardship in terms of prospective sales.
3.
An expressed economic need requiring a variance, when such a need can be met in other ways which would not require a variance.
B.
Relief from the hardship—the variance—must not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes of this ordinance.
C.
When a variance is issued, the spirit of this ordinance must be observed and the public safety and welfare secured. A variance may be granted only for permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property in question is located. (For example, a two-family dwelling would not be allowed to be placed in an R-1 district under a variance.)
D.
The developer or owner wishing to request a variance must have at least 51 percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning commission or board of commissioners may also propose a variance. However, the power to approve a variance rests with the planning commission.
E.
Application for a variance may be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the planning commission for its consideration. No application is to be accepted from any person in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for a variance or any other action by the planning commission is, at the time of such application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one of the following:
1.
He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation.
2.
Has been tried before a court of competent jurisdiction and acquitted of charges and presents a certified copy of the court order to the administrative officer within 30 days of the final order of the court.
F.
When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by either [subsection] 1. or 2. above, the administrative officer will then accept the application for variance.
G.
When an application for a variance is received, the administrative officer must post a sign at least two feet by three feet in size in a conspicuous place on the property, visible from all bordering public streets, at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing. The sign must set forth the fact that it is a "variance notice." It must show the date, time, and place of the scheduled public hearing, and it must inform the public that additional information may be obtained from the administrative officer.
H.
When an application for a variance is received, the planning commission will set a time and place for a public hearing on the variance. Notice of the hearing must be published in the legal organ (newspaper) of Upson County at least 15 days before the hearing. Such notice will state the application number, owner's name, property location, its area, time, place and subject of the hearing. At least 15 days before the public hearing, notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing will be sent to the appellant or petitioner in writing by U.S. mail to his last known address. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant file for permanent record.
I.
The planning commission will make a decision concerning the variance and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting.
J.
The variance issued by the planning commission must specify which requirements are to be varied from. It must specify alternative requirements to be met, replacing the requirements varied from.
K.
The planning commission may establish performance bonds to assure compliance with any requirements it has set for granting a variance. Where a variance is granted for a construction activity requiring a building permit, the building permit must be obtained and construction must begin within six months of the issuance of the variance. Otherwise, the variance expires after six months.
L.
The decision of the planning commission on the application for variance may be appealed on points of law to the board of commissioners and then to the superior court of Upson County.
Section 408. - Conditional zoning.
A.
When a parcel of property is placed in a certain zoning district, all permitted uses for that zoning district are allowed on the property as long as the published requirements of this ordinance and other development regulations of Upson County are met. However, in certain situations, only one of the permitted uses for a district may be appropriate for a parcel of property while many of the other uses within the range of those permitted would not be appropriate—or certain design, location, aesthetic, or other standards may be needed to mask otherwise undesirable effects of a permitted use. In such cases, conditional zoning may be granted by the board of commissioners.
B.
The following situations are permitted under conditional zoning:
1.
The use of land may be specifically limited to any one or more of the permitted uses for the zoning district in which the land is placed.
2.
Special requirements of design, location, aesthetics, or other considerations may be imposed for the uses permitted on the land.
3.
Any combination of the above two categories of conditions may be imposed.
C.
Conditional zoning is attached to a specific lot or group of lots—not to the owner(s). If ownership of the lot(s) changes, continued compliance with the special conditions must be maintained by the new owner(s).
D.
Conditional zoning may be proposed by the board of commissioners, the planning commission, the petitioner for a zoning amendment, or any person who may be affected by the subject property.
E.
A tract of land to which special conditions have been attached continues to be subject to all other requirements of this ordinance and other applicable regulations of Upson County which are not in conflict with those special conditions.
F.
Whenever a tract of land has had special conditions imposed upon it and a building permit is applied for, plans and specifications which are drawn in compliance with the special conditions must be submitted with the application for a permit.
G.
Two sets of plans and specifications must be submitted to the administrative officer in application for a building permit. Upon approval, the administrative officer will certify in writing his approval upon the plans and specifications. The copies of the approved plans and specifications will be distributed as follows:
1.
One copy to record of rezoning file.
2.
One copy to applicant.
H.
When conditional zoning has been granted for a parcel of property, and no building permit for the property has been applied for within 12 months of the date of such conditional zoning, the property will revert to its original zoning prior to the conditional zoning. However, the owner of the property conditionally zoned may request the board of commissioners to extend the conditional zoning for up to 12 months. If the board of commissioners find just cause for extending the conditional zoning, it may be extended for a period of up to 12 months.
I.
The zoning of any parcel of land which is subject to special conditions will be indicated on the official map by its zoning district designation followed by "C" (for example "R-1-C").
J.
Any granting of conditional zoning is an amendment of this ordinance, and procedures contained in section 410 must be followed.
Section 409. - Special exceptions.
A.
Some zoning districts permit certain uses only upon approval of the planning commission. These are called special exceptions. Consideration is given to whether or not the objectives of this ordinance will be hindered in an individual situation.
B.
The developer or owner wishing to request a special exception must have at least 51 percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning commission or board of commissioners may also propose a special exception. However, the power to approve a special exception rests with the planning commission.
C.
Application for a special exception may be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the planning commission for its consideration. No application is to be accepted from any person in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for special exception or any other action by the planning commission is, at the time of such an application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one of the following:
1.
He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation.
2.
He must be tried before a court of competent jurisdiction and acquitted of charges and present a certified copy of the court order to the administrative officer within 30 days of the final order of the court.
D.
When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by either [subsection] 1. or 2. above, the administrative officer will then accept the application for special exception.
E.
When an application for a special exception is received, the administrative officer must post a sign at least two feet by three feet in size in a conspicuous place on the property, visible from all bordering public streets, at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing. The sign must set forth the fact that it is a "special exception notice." It must show the date, time, and place of the scheduled public hearing, and it must inform the public that additional information may be obtained from the administrative officer.
F.
When an application for a special exception is received, the planning commission will set a time and place for a public hearing on the special exception. Notice of the hearing must be published in the legal organ (newspaper) of Upson County at least 15 days before the hearing. Such a notice will state the application number, owner's name, property location, its area, time, place, and subject of the hearing. At least 15 days prior to the hearing, notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing will be sent to the appellant or petitioner in writing by U.S. mail to his last known address. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant file for permanent record.
G.
The planning commission will make its decision concerning the special exception and record the decision in the minutes of that meeting.
H.
The decision of the planning commission on the application for special exception may be appealed on points of law to the board of commissioners and then to the superior court of Upson County.
I.
The planning commission will consider the following points in arriving at a decision on the special exception:
1.
It must not be contrary to the purpose of this ordinance.
2.
It must not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties, or to the general neighborhood; it must not adversely affect the health or safety of residents or workers.
3.
It must not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such a facility, vehicular movement, noise or fumes generated, or type of physical activity.
4.
It must not adversely affect existing uses, and it must be proposed to be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of the use.
5.
It must meet all other requirements of this ordinance.
J.
The planning commission may require any additional restrictions and development standards on a special exception as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents.
K.
If the planning commission finds that any restrictions upon which a special exception was granted are not being complied with, it will revoke the permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing. All work must cease until the decision is final.
( Ord. No. 242 , § 1, 6-9-2015)
Section 410. - Amendments.
A.
If a developer or landowner finds that a proposed new use of his land does not meet the requirements of this ordinance, he may request that this ordinance be amended to permit his proposed use. The developer or owner wishing to request an amendment of the official map must have at least 51 percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing under the owner's signature. The planning commission or the board of commissioners may also propose an amendment. However, the power to approve and enact an amendment rests with the board of commissioners.
B.
Application for an amendment may be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the planning commission for its consideration. No application is to be accepted from any person in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for an amendment or any other action by the planning commission is, at the time of such an application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one of the following:
1.
He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation.
2.
He must be tried before a court of competent jurisdiction and acquitted of charges and present a certified copy of the court order to the administrative officer within 30 days of the final order of the court.
C.
When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by either [subsection] 1. or 2. above, the administrative officer will then accept the application for amendment.
D.
When an amendment is initiated which involves changing the zoning district of a parcel of land, the administrative officer must post a sign at least two feet by three feet in size in a conspicuous place on the property, visible from all bordering public streets, at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing. The sign must set forth the fact that it is a "zoning notice." It must show the present zoning classification, the proposed zoning classification, the purpose, date, time, and place of the scheduled public hearing, and it must inform the public that additional information may be obtained from the administrative officer.
E.
All applications for amendment must first be reviewed by the planning commission. The planning commission will study the proposed amendment and determine if it meets the requirements of this ordinance, as well as other applicable ordinances of Upson County. At this time, the administrative officer may review the proposed amendment and make written recommendations to the planning commission.
F.
The planning commission must then conduct a public hearing on the amendment. The responsibility of conducting the public hearing is delegated by the board of commissioners to the planning commission under provisions specified in the Zoning Procedures Law (O.C.G.A. § 36-66-1, enacted by 1985 Ga. Laws, page 1139, 1.), paragraph 2-(b)-(1). (See section 105, paragraph F of this ordinance for additional details.) Notice of the hearing must be published in the legal organ (newspaper) of Upson County at least 15 days but not more than 45 days before the hearing. The location of the property, present zoning classification, proposed zoning classification, owner's name and the time, date, and place of the hearing must be indicated in the newspaper notice.
G.
The following policies and procedures shall be applicable to the calling and conducting of public hearings required by O.C.G.A. § 36-66-4 and the Upson County Zoning Ordinance for both the Upson County Planning Commission and the Upson County Board of Commissioners:
1.
The zoning hearing shall be held at the time and place provided in the published notice of the hearing and shall be conducted on the premises of the Upson County Courthouse.
2.
In order for a person in attendance at the public hearing to speak on a matter, with the exception of the applicant and/or his/her designated representative, such person shall register with the person designated by the planning commission or the board of commissioners prior to the time of the meeting at which the application in question shall be heard. Such registration shall include:
a.
Name, address, and telephone number of the person wishing to speak.
b.
The matter on which the person wishes to speak.
c.
Whether the person intends to speak as a proponent or opponent.
d.
Whether the person has been named as a representative to speak on behalf of a particular group.
3.
The planning commission chairman or the chairman of the board of commissioners shall review for those present, at the commencement of the hearing, the procedures set forth herein and shall call each listed application before the commission or board.
4.
If the subject of the hearing is a zoning decision initiated by a petitioner other than the board of commissioners, the petitioner requesting such zoning decision, or the petitioner's agent, shall be recognized first and shall be permitted to present and explain the request for the zoning decision. Thereafter, all individuals who are registered and who so desire shall be permitted to speak in favor of the zoning decision. If the request for a zoning decision is initiated by the board of commissioners, all members of the board of commissioners shall be allowed to speak as they are recognized by the presiding officer, regardless of whether such board member speaks in favor of or in opposition to the proposed zoning decision.
5.
The planning commission members or the board of commissioners will question the applicant on his application. The chairman shall then call upon persons who have registered to speak in opposition to the application.
6.
In the case of a request by a petitioner to rezone property, the petitioner shall have an opportunity, after all comments in opposition have been made, to make summary remarks concerning the proposed zoning decision.
7.
After public comments have been heard as to the matter, the presiding officer shall announce that the public hearing for the requested zoning decision is closed, and the board of commissioners or the planning commission, as the case may be, shall immediately discuss the proposed zoning decision in public among themselves and vote on action which they are authorized to take.
8.
Each speaker shall speak from the podium or area designated and preface his or her remarks by stating his or her name, address, and the organization or group represented by the speaker, if any. The length of time for oral presentations permitted to each speaker will be governed by the planning commission or the board of commissioners, depending upon the number of persons present and desiring to speak. Each speaker, other than the petitioner, will be allotted the same amount of time to speak, provided they comply with the policies set out herein.
9.
No debate between speakers shall be permitted nor will debate or argument with the planning commission or the board of commissioners be permitted or tolerated. Speakers shall be expected to conduct themselves in an appropriate manner and involvement of personalities or the use of abusive or profane language shall not be allowed. Speakers will be ruled out of order for such infractions.
10.
As a result of time constraints and hearings, interested parties shall be encouraged to submit petitions, studies, letters, and other materials requiring prior study in time to have them included in their file agenda. The board of commissioners or the planning commission shall have the discretion to accept such materials at the hearing if circumstances do not permit earlier submittal. Such materials, if presented orally at the hearing, shall be subject to the time limits provided above. The planning commission or the board of commissioners shall have the discretion to continue a hearing to a later date if the materials submitted or views expressed require more time for study and consideration than may be reasonably allocated in one meeting.
11.
The board of commissioners may call for such additional views, studies, or other information from any source they consider necessary to make a sound decision on a proposed zoning action.
12.
Any person desiring a transcript of the hearing must arrange for a court reporter at their own expense.
13.
"Standing" to challenge a zoning decision is not conferred by being permitted to speak orally at a hearing, nor by being permitted to file statements or pleadings.
H.
Whenever this county shall exercise its zoning power, the following standards are considered relevant and shall be considered in balancing the county's interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of property:
1.
Whether the zoning proposal will permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent or nearby property.
2.
Whether the zoning proposal will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property.
3.
Whether the property affected by the zoning decision has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned.
4.
Whether the zoning proposal is in conformity with the policy and intent of any adopted land use plan.
5.
Whether there are other existing conditions affecting the use and the development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of a zoning proposal.
6.
The length of time the property has been vacant.
7.
The threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if rezoned.
I.
The county may also consider whether development of the property in the zoning classification sought would do any of the following:
1.
Have an adverse effect on the insurance rating of the county, or any substantial portion of the county, issued by the Insurance Service Office or similar rating agency.
2.
Overtax the public utilities and streets presently existing to serve the site.
3.
Have a substantial adverse impact on the environment, including, but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion, and sedimentation, flooding, air quality, and water quality and quantity.
J.
After the public hearing, and at an official meeting of the planning commission, the planning commission will formulate its recommendations to the board of commissioners, recording them in the minutes for that meeting. The planning commission may decide to make no recommendation or it may make any of the following recommendations with respect to an application for an amendment: approval, denial, deferral, withdrawal without prejudice, reduction of the land area for which the application is made, change of the zoning district requested, or imposition of zoning conditions. The planning commission must send its recommendations on the proposed amendment in writing to the board of commissioners within 45 days of the close of the public hearing. If the planning commission fails to send its recommendations to the board of commissioners within 45 days of the close of the public hearing, it will mean that the planning commission approves of the proposed amendment.
K.
[Action of the board of commissioners.]
1.
Before taking action on a proposed amendment and after receipt of the planning commission recommendations and reports thereon, the board of commissioners shall hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 36-66-4.
2.
So that the purpose of this zoning ordinance will be served and so that the health, public safety, and general welfare will be secured, the board of commissioners may, in its legislative discretion, approve or deny the proposed amendment as submitted, reduce the land area for which the application is made, change the zoning district to one other than that requested, or add or delete zoning conditions as the board deems appropriate. The board of commissioners shall also have the legislative discretion to grant a conditional use in its decision to rezone property. An action to defer a decision on the proposed amendment shall include a specific meeting date to which the proposed amendment is deferred. The board of commissioners may also approve a withdrawal of an application, and if so stipulated by the board in its decision to approve withdrawal, the 12-month limitation on refiling of the application for the same property shall not apply.
L.
If the board of commissioners deny a proposed amendment, a minimum period of 12 months must pass before the same amendment proposal is again submitted for consideration.
Section 411. - (Reserved).
Section 412. - Appealing an action of the board of commissioners.
If the board of commissioners execute an action which the developer or other aggrieved party believes to be contrary to law, that action may be appealed to the Upson County Superior Court. Findings of fact, however, may not be appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date on which the action of the board of commissioners was taken. To appeal an action of the board of commissioners, first obtain a written signed decision from the board of commissioners as to the matter which is being appealed and then comply with the requirements of state law regarding certiorari to the superior court (O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1 et seq.).

Section 413. - Penalties.
Any person who violates any of the provisions of this ordinance must face penalties. If a developer or landowner exhausts the decision and appeals procedures contained in article 4 and is still dissatisfied with the decision, he must then comply with the final decision or face penalties. Anyone who violates any of the provisions of this ordinance, upon conviction, will be fined no more than $500.00 for each offense. In addition, he must pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such a violation continues constitutes a separate offense.
A.
The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part thereof, and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains such a violation may each be found guilty of a separate offense and suffer the penalties provided here[in].
Section 414. - Remedies.
If any building or land is used or maintained in violation of this ordinance, anyone, including the county, who would be harmed by such a violation may initiate legal proceedings to obtain an injunction or other appropriate remedy to stop the violation or to prevent any act which would constitute such a violation. Other legal remedies are also available as provided by Georgia law.
