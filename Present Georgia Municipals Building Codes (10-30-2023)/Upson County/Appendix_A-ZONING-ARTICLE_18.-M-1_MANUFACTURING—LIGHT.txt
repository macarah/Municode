ARTICLE 18. - M-1 MANUFACTURING—LIGHT[8]

Footnotes:
--- (8) ---
Cross reference— Businesses, ch. 26.

Section 1801. - Purpose.
M-1 zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve physically and aesthetically desirable areas in which clean, low-intensity manufacturing activities may locate and be protected from the intrusion of incompatible land uses. By having such areas available, both new and existing industries may operate and undertake expansion of facilities with the least possible adverse effect on other types of activities which might be incompatible with manufacturing. The elimination of nonmanufacturing activities from M-1 districts benefits manufacturing activities by removing some possible obstacles to their smooth operation and expansion.
Section 1802. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within an M-1 district.
The factors contained in section 410 of this ordinance must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission as well as the board of commissioners when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will assure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made. Land use decisions which are based on sound planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of Upson County.
Section 1803. - Boundaries of M-1 districts.
The official map (section 2301 of this ordinance) shows the boundaries of all M-1 districts within Upson County. Article 23 also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc.
Section 1804. - Permitted uses.
