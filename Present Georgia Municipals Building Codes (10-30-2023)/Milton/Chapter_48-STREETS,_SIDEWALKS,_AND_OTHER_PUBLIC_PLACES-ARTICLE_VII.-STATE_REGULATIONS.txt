Driver means every person who drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle.
FHWA means the Federal Highway Administration.
Functional classification means a listing and map which identifies which roads are major arterial, minor arterial, and collector.
GDOT means the Georgia Department of Transportation.
LOS (level of service) means a quantitative and qualitative measure of how well traffic flows on a given street or highway. The term "level of service" includes such factors as highway width, number of lanes, percentage of trucks, total traffic volume, turning movements, lateral clearances, grades, sight distance, capacity in relation to volume, travel speed and other factors which affect the quality of flow. The term "level of service" is typically summarized by letter grades described as follows:
(1)
Highway levels of service, per 15-minute flow period and intended for application to segments of significant length per direction per the Highway Capacity Manual 2000.
a.
Level "A" means nearly free-flow conditions with low traffic volumes, high speeds and free-flow conditions. Passing demand is well below capacity. Drivers are delayed no more than 40 percent of their travel time by slow-moving vehicles. A maximum flow rate of 490 pc/h total in both directions may be achieved with base conditions. Speeds are at or above the posted speed limit may require strict enforcement.
b.
Level "B" means nearly free-flow conditions with light traffic volumes, minor speed restrictions and stable flow. The demand for passing to maintain desired speeds becomes significant and approximates the lower boundary of the LOS B. Drivers are delayed in platoons up to 55 percent of the time. Service flow rates of 780 pc/h total in both directions can be achieved under base conditions. Above this flow rate, the number of platoons increase dramatically. Speeds are still very near the posted speed limit.
c.
Level "C" means nearly free flow conditions, moderate traffic volumes, where speed and maneuvering are restricted to a limited degree by the amount of traffic. This results in noticeable increases in platoon formation, platoon size, and frequency of passing impediments. Although the flow is stable, it is susceptible to congestion due to turning traffic and slow-moving vehicles. Percent time-following may reach 70 percent. A service flow rate of up to 1,190 pc/h total in both directions can be accommodated under base conditions. Speeds are still near the posted speed limit.
d.
Level "D" means a condition with heavy traffic operating at tolerable speeds and restricted maneuverability, although temporary slowdowns in flow may occur. The two opposing traffic streams beginning to operate separately at higher volume levels, as passing becomes extremely difficult. Passing demand is high, but passing capacity approaches zero. Mean platoon sizes of five to ten vehicles are common, although speeds of 40 mph can still be maintained under base conditions. Turning vehicles and roadside distractions cause major shock waves in the traffic stream. Motorists are delayed in platoons for nearly 85 percent of their travel time. Maximum service flow rates of 1,830 pc/h total in both directions can be maintained under base conditions.
e.
Level "E" means considered at capacity, a condition of very heavy flow, very little if any freedom to maneuver, and reasonably low speeds. Under Level "E" the traffic is unstable and short stoppage may occur. Traffic flow conditions have a percent time-spent following greater than 85 percent. Even under base flow conditions, speeds may drop below 40 mph. Average travel speeds on highways with less than base conditions will be slower, even down to 25 mph on sustained upgrades. Passing is virtually impossible at LOS E and platooning becomes intense, as slower vehicles or other interruptions are encountered. The highest volume attainable under LOS E defines the capacity of the highway, generally 3,200 pc/h total in both directions. Operating conditions at capacity are unstable and difficult to predict. Traffic operations seldom reach near capacity on rural highways, primarily because of lack of demand.
f.
Level "F" means a condition of extremely heavy flow, with frequent stoppage, significant queuing at constricted points and very slow speeds. It is an unstable traffic condition under which traffic often comes to a complete halt. Volumes are lower than capacity and speeds are highly variable.
(2)
Stop controlled intersection levels of service, per approach per the Highway Capacity Manual 2000.
a.
Level "A" means the average control delay of 0—10 seconds per vehicle (s/veh).
b.
Level "B" means the average control delay of 10—15 seconds per vehicle (s/veh).
c.
Level "C" means the average control delay of 15—25 seconds per vehicle (s/veh).
d.
Level "D" means the average control delay of 25—35 seconds per vehicle (s/veh).
e.
Level "E" means the average control delay of 35—50 seconds per vehicle (s/veh).
f.
Level "F" means average control delay of greater than 50 seconds per vehicle (s/veh).
(3)
Signalized intersection levels of service, per lane per approach per the Highway Capacity Manual 2000.
a.
Level "A" means the average control delay of 0—10 seconds per vehicle (s/veh).
b.
Level "B" means average control delay of 10—20 seconds per vehicle (s/veh).
c.
Level "C" means the average control delay of 20—35 seconds per vehicle (s/veh).
d.
Level "D" means the average control delay of 35—55 seconds per vehicle (s/veh).
e.
Level "E" means the average control delay of 55—80 seconds per vehicle (s/veh).
f.
Level "F" means the average control delay of greater than 80 seconds per vehicle (s/veh).
Local streets (roads with volumes of less than 4,000 vpd) means a level of functional classification and city roads will be listed on the official Functional Classification Map annually updated.

Sec. 48-562. - Creation of sidewalks.
The city council for the City of Milton finds that sidewalks, both internal and along the entire road frontage of a development, primarily advance the interests of the owners and occupants of such development. Such interests so advanced include (1) increasing intra-development pedestrian mobility; (2) promoting exercise and wellness; (3) creating a sense of community; (4) reducing vehicular traffic; and (5) increasing overall development safety. Accordingly, sidewalks shall be installed as follows:
(1)
All owners, developers, or occupiers of parcels of land where a development permit or building permit is issued and any portion of the parcel is within a zoning overlay district or form based code district where sidewalks are required or are one-half mile of a school or active public park and the parcel is not identified on the current bike and pedestrian master plan shall be required to provide a sidewalk, consistent with the city standards.
a.
Such sidewalk shall conform to the AASHTO and applicable ADA requirements and to all applicable overlay district guidelines and standards.
b.
Sidewalks internal to subdivisions shall be installed in accordance with the City of Milton Subdivision regulations.
c.
Where it is determined to be in the best interest of the city payment in lieu of installation may be made in accordance with section 48-674(3).
(2)
In cases where a development permit or building permit is sought on tract of land proposed for single-family development:
a.
In major subdivisions or on commercial projects, the city shall require internal pedestrian facilities on both sides of any public or private right-of-way or as may be required in the subdivision regulations. Subsequently, the development permit shall indicate proposed construction of pedestrian facilities on all proposed streets and along the entire frontage when required.
b.
The installation and city acceptance of required sidewalk shall be completed prior to a certificate of occupancy being issued for the building or structure on the affected parcel.
(3)
Where trees exist or other conditions exist, the city may require the sidewalks to meander in the right-of-way or into the lot where the permit is being sought. Should the sidewalk meander out of the right-of-way, a sidewalk easement or additional right-of-way dedication will be required. Meandering designs shall not be severe radii to better accommodate persons with disabilities. (See article VIII of this chapter.)
(4)
The city shall require the sidewalk to be installed at least five feet from the back of curb along the road unless the city determines a practical difficulty exists or an overlay district requires an additional setback.
(5)
Exceptions. This section shall not apply to any lot or parcel for which a development permit or building permit is issued but where the city determines that the permit is for an accessory use or structure to the principal use or structure or for minor repairs or additions to the principal building or structure in existence. Such determination will be made by the community development department.
( Ord. No. 16-07-278 , § 1, 7-11-2016; Ord. No. 18-08-368 , § 1, 8-6-2018)
Sec. 48-563. - Existing sidewalks.
(a)
For any land or building development where sidewalks are required as outlined in section 48-562, and there is an existing sidewalk along the road or street frontage, an inspection of the sidewalk shall be made by the city. If the inspection shows the sidewalk is deficient or does not exist along the entire frontage, the owner must construct or repair the sidewalk to current design specifications including material revisions, such as concrete to brick, as required by the city.
(b)
The property owner shall be required to maintain the sidewalk along the entire lot frontage by maintaining the grass or landscaping in the right-of-way.
(c)
No person shall be permitted to erect any drain, gutter, downspout, valley, flat, or sloping roof of any character that will in any manner drain or shed water on any sidewalk of the city.

(2)
Requests. If a request is made for decorative sign poles, the neighborhood must submit a formal traffic control signage plan showing the recommended placement, size, type of pole, and type of sign to be installed. This is more than a sign shop detail page. The transportation engineer or his or her designee will evaluate the request with final comments. All signs and poles must meet the requirements set forth in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) (www.mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov.). If decorative sign poles are approved, only a qualified sign contractor is allowed to install the devices. If decorative sign poles are used, there must be a signed and recorded agreement from the homeowners' association stating that they will be responsible for maintaining the decorative poles. If a decorative pole is damaged and not replaced within 48 hours, the public works department will install a standard pole and standard sign if located on a public street. If the decorative pole is replaced, the contractor must contact the public works department for the city to retrieve the standard pole if located on a public street. The length of the sign pole must be high enough to allow for vertical clearance of the signs mounted. There will be no cost to the city associated with the installation or maintenance of decorative poles.
(b)

Other types of landowners with private lighting are likewise required to pay for utility bills on their respective properties.
(2)
Requests. Requests for street lighting by citizens or businesses, city boards and commissions shall be directed to the public works department. Should such application show that street lighting would provide a significant traffic safety difference, such request will be added to the capital improvement plan at either the annual or midyear listing. Should such application show that street lighting is a non-transportation safety project, the application will be denied and placed on the long range list for capital improvement projects. Should the denied applicant desire to move this forward more quickly, the applicant can pay 100 percent of the cost of materials and installations by a qualified utility contractor or the electrical utility company directly, the city would accept the streetlights as a gift in kind and thus repair, maintain, and pay utility bills for such streetlights on public rights-of-way.
(3)
Removal. Requests for removal of street lighting by citizens within a subdivision considered rural on the City of Milton Future Land Use Plan may be considered through a petition and application process for removal of streetlights as defined in the public works policies.

DIVISION 3. - PROHIBITIONS AND USES

Sec. 48-584. - Obstruction of right-of-way.
(a)
No person shall place or cause to place in any right-of-way: debris, rubbish, irrigation water, boxes, displays, signs, poles, goods, merchandise, or any other object so as to impede or endanger traffic on streets and sidewalks.
(b)
No person or company shall construct or maintain a drive, yard, or lot constructed of gravel, pebbles, or stone in such a manner that vehicles cause loose stones, pebbles or gravel to be thrown on to the adjacent street or sidewalk.
(c)
Any personal property placed on the right-of-way following an eviction notice shall be removed within 24 hours of physical eviction unless an extension of time is requested on behalf of the evicted tenant. For purposes of this chapter such property is deemed abandoned property 24 hours following eviction unless the landlord by contract specifies a shorter time. If the property is not removed within 24 hours, the city may commence removal and cite the property owner. The penalty assessed shall be 125 percent of the cost the city incurs in removing the property plus a fine of $1,000.00 shall be incurred.
(d)
Illegal dumping within the right-of-way shall be removed within 24 hours of the notice of violation if not considered an immediate threat but will be removed immediately if considered an immediate threat to safety by the public works department. If the city is required to remove such debris, a penalty of 125 percent of the cost the city incurred in removing the property plus a $1,000.00 fine shall be assessed.
( Ord. No. 16-07-278 , § 1, 7-11-2016)
Sec. 48-585. - Location within the right-of-way.
(a)
A right-of-way and utility encroachment permit is required for all activities within the right-of-way including, but not limited to, the construction, installation, repair or replacement of pipe, conduit, cable or other facilities vital to the function of the utility or construction site referenced for the flow of traffic (vehicles and pedestrians) (i.e., a driveway, shoulder, or road construction) at the referenced location. Such permit shall be managed by the public works department.
(b)
Irrigation systems, landscaping, fences, walls, nonoperable vehicles, trailers, boats, dumpsters and other fixed objects within the right-of-way that, in the reasonable opinion of the city traffic engineer or his/her designee, may pose a safety hazard are not allowed within the right-of-way. However; certain landscaping and irrigation systems may be permitted upon the submittal of an indemnification form and other documents as may be required by the public works department.
(1)
New unpermitted installations of such encroachments shall be removed, and shoulders dressed at the cost of the property owner within 30 calendar days of the citation plus a fine of one-half the cost of the largest permit fee for the site. Should such installations be on an active construction site, all CO's, LDP's, final plats, or other pressing applications to the city will be held until such fine is paid by the property owner.
(2)
Existing installations shall be subject to safety evaluations and must be relocated outside of the right-of-way when major repairs or replacement occurs. Safety evaluations by public works may result in an eviction notice and subsequent removal of such installation. Such removal shall occur within 30 calendar days; however, no fine shall be assessed for existing permitted installations. The burden of proof for the date of existing installations shall be by the Fulton County permit date, dated construction drawings, or receipts. Without these, a fine shall be assessed as if it was a new unpermitted installation.
(3)
Temporary items such as dumpsters, parked semi-trucks, and other related items as determined by the public works department shall be given a citation and will be towed from the right-of-way immediately to the subject parcel. The cost to the city will be reimbursed at a rate of 125 percent plus a $500.00 fine awarded to the property owner. An exception shall be moving to or from a house: a semi without a tractor is allowed to park on a neighborhood street when a right-of-way encroachment permit is approved, and proper advance warning signage is used. The maximum length of time this permit for this application will be valid shall be 48 hours.
(c)
Mailboxes. Mailboxes are subject to all regulations of the United States Postal Service (USPS). In addition:
(1)
Single breakaway post mailboxes shall be the standard installation, placed five feet from the edge of pavement. This installation shall not require a permit.
(2)
Notwithstanding the discretion in section 48-585(b) for certain fixed objects in the right-of-way, fixed object mailboxes (i.e., brick, stone, concrete, stucco, anything other than a standard mailbox) are not allowed within the right-of-way. Installations of such mailboxes shall also be subject to other requirements of this chapter and the AASHTO Roadside Design Guide, current edition.
(d)
Trees. Trees within the right-of-way shall be classified as follows:
(1)
Shoulders. Street trees are required to be planted behind the sidewalk for urban sections or outside of the AASHTO defined clear zone for on-system roadways, this may extend outside of the right-of-way onto personal property for on-system roadways. The right-of-way encroachment permit is required for plantings inside the right-of-way but outside of the clear zone. Any tree within the right-of-way is subject to removal for safety reasons upon coordination of public works and the city arborist. Street trees planted in the beauty strip are subject to removal by the city for safety reasons. When the beauty strip is the only area available for planting, as determined by the city arborist, the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) category breakaway trees such as crepe myrtles, hollies, etc., shall be planted there and must be maintained by trimming appropriately by the property owner through a right-of-way landscaping agreement.
(2)
Medians. Only Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) category breakway trees shall be acceptable within planted medians. Additional landscaping maintained below 18 inches is also acceptable. When median street trees are impacted, show signs of decline, or have a safety concern, as determined by the city arborist, the replacement trees in the median shall meet this updated requirement. Trees planted in the medians and shoulders must also meet:
a.
The AASHTO Roadside Design Guide; and
b.
The GDOT Pedestrian and Streetscape Guide.
(e)
On-street parking.
(1)
Vehicles may park on roads of subsequent width unless specifically prohibited by signage. The city may regulate and prohibit parking of any type of vehicle on any public road. It shall be unlawful to park any truck or any trailer which is designated by the department of public safety for a license tag in a weight category heavier than 6,000 pounds on the right-of-way of any residential street or upon residential zoned property, unless said vehicle is making a delivery to said residential property. School buses shall not fall under this section.
a.
This section shall not apply to construction vehicles, trailers, or equipment temporarily located (maximum six hours) within a construction area, provided such vehicles, trailers or equipment are used in connection with dwelling units under construction within such construction area.
b.
Such officer is authorized to move such vehicle or require the driver or other person to move the same. If the vehicle is unattended, such officer is authorized to remove or provide for the removal of such vehicle to the nearest garage or other place of safety at the owner's expense. State or local law enforcement officers and the department are further authorized, with or without the owner's consent, to remove or have removed any obstruction, cargo, or personal property which is abandoned, unattended, or damaged as a result of a vehicle accident which the department determines to be a threat to public health or safety or to mitigate traffic congestion.
(2)
Vehicles and trailers of any kind without current license plates, or vehicles, trailers or equipment permitted to remain in an inoperable condition for more than 30 days shall not be parked or stored on or about any property within a residential-zoned district; provided, however, this section shall not apply to vehicles, trailers or equipment stored in an enclosed structure or appropriately covered and located in the rear yard area.
(3)
Exception: moving to or from a house. A semi with attached tractor is allowed to park on a neighborhood street when a right-of-way encroachment permit is approved and proper advance warning signage is used. The maximum length of time this permit for this application will be valid shall be 24 hours. MUTCD acceptable cones, barricades, and other appropriate warning devices shall be placed to provide advance warning to motorists.
(4)
The city may place parking meters on or immediately adjacent to any or all of such roads for the purpose of authorizing timed parking in designated spaces upon the payment of a charge for such privilege. A municipality also may place such parking meters on or adjacent to any public road on the state highway system located within the corporate limits of the municipality when authorized by GDOT.

Sec. 48-610. - Objectives.
The city finds that requiring a traffic impact study for proposed developments that meet certain thresholds will help to achieve the following objectives:
(1)
Forecast additional traffic associated with new development, based on accepted practices.
(2)
Determine the improvements that are necessary to accommodate the new development.
(3)
Allow the local government to assess the impacts that a proposed development may have and assist the local government in making decisions regarding development proposals.
(4)
Help to ensure safe and reasonable traffic conditions on streets after the development is complete.
(5)
Reduce the negative impacts created by developments by helping to ensure that the transportation network can accommodate the development.
(6)
Protect the substantial public investment in the street system.
(7)
Provide information relevant to:
a.
Comprehensive planning;
b.
Transportation planning;
c.
Transit planning; and
d.
The provision of programs and facilities for:
1.
Traffic safety;
2.
Road improvements;
3.
Transportation demand management;
4.
Pedestrian access; and
5.
Other transportation system considerations.
( Ord. No. 16-07-278 , § 1, 7-11-2016)
Sec. 48-611. - Analyses.
The source for trip generation rates for the purposes of this chapter shall be the Trip Generation and Handbook published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), most recent edition. Determinations of whether this chapter applies shall be made based on application of data from ITE Trip Generation, which may change from time to time, or as otherwise approved by the city engineer.
(1)
Discussion of assumptions.
a.
Distributions. Default value is to assume site distribution will be the same split as existing conditions. Call out any exceptions to this. For developments expected to generate more than 30 truck trips per day, the study shall include separate trip distribution figures for trucks.
b.
Total combined trip reduction (pass-by and internal capture) shall be calculated for both a cap of ten percent maximum and also the recommended ITE value.
c.
Growth factors. Provide analysis of both zero percent growth rate and calculated growth rate. A cap of ten percent growth rate without prior transportation engineer approval for areas within the city. For areas of impact outside city or county limits, higher growth rates are acceptable.
d.
Any caps that desire hardship must submit information calculated within the set requirements stated in subsections (1)a. through (1)c. of this section to prove hardship with the city engineer.
(2)
Technical analysis.
a.
A scoping meeting with the applicant's traffic engineer and transportation engineer is required prior to submittal of a traffic impact study. Failure by an applicant to not have a scoping meeting prior to conducting their traffic counts will not constitute a hardship for an exception to be approved by the city engineer.
b.
A preliminary site access, site circulation, and parking plan will be prepared by the applicant early in the project. The plan is considered in the trip generation, trip distribution and assignment steps.
c.
Existing traffic volumes (measured within the previous six months and adjusted to reflect current conditions; tube counts shall be a minimum of 48 hours) and performance operation analysis for all study intersections including all arterial, collector and local roads within the study area, in the year that the proposed development is planned to commence, and in five years. If phased development is proposed, the traffic impact study shall include projections for the year that each phase of the development is planned to be complete.
d.
Level of service. All signalized and all-way stop controlled intersections shall operate at a LOS "D" or better. Other unsignalized intersections (including unsignalized private accesses) shall operate at LOS "E" or better for major left turns and side street approaches, although LOS "F" may be allowed if the movement has a relatively low volume (to-capacity ratio and there are no known safety problems at the intersection).
e.
Pass-by trips are external to the development but are already on the transportation system (not new trips on the roadway). These trips enter the site as an intermediate stop, or are incepted by the proposed development. The pass-by rate (or percentage of total site trip generation that are pass-by trips) is discussed in the scoping meeting. Trip reduction for pass-by trips shall be as follows:
1.
Calculate pass-by trips as provided for in the ITE Trip Generation Handbook.
2.
Perform a limits test, limiting the total pass-by trips associated with a site to ten percent of the adjacent roadway's project traffic capacity.
f.
Mode split analysis is currently required only along state routes. Typically three to five percent is considered a maximum realistic share of travel for modes other than automobiles.
g.
Acceptable analysis methods include the most recent Highway Capacity Manual or Synchro.
h.
Signal timing used in capacity or progression analysis shall use the same cycle length as it is currently using at the intersection unless specifically noted otherwise and should not exceed 120 seconds. Signal timing shall provide adequate and reasonable green time for pedestrian crossings.
i.
Peak hour factors less than 0.75 or greater than 0.90 shall not be used unless justified by specific counts at that location.
j.
The applicant shall forecast estimated traffic volumes and performance operation analysis with the development on all arterial, collector and local roads within the study area, in the year that the proposed development is planned to commence, and in five years. If phased development is proposed, the traffic impact study shall include projections for the year that each phase of the development is planned to be complete.
( Ord. No. 16-07-278 , § 1, 7-11-2016)
Sec. 48-612. - Mitigation.
(a)
Description and analysis of mitigation measures necessary to bring the identified intersections and locations into compliance with applicable standards. Include analysis showing that these measures will bring these locations into compliance and include signal, turn lane, or other warrant analyses as appropriate.
(b)
Often mitigation measures will be involved in rezoning applications. However, should a project already be zoned commercial or other intense land use, and the traffic impact study deems mitigation measures are necessary, such mitigation measures deemed necessary by the transportation engineer and affirmed by the applicant's data shall be deemed necessary improvements at the cost of the proposed private development.
(c)
The proposed development for which a traffic impact study is submitted and mitigation measures are deemed necessary by the transportation engineer and affirmed by the applicant's data shall be deemed necessary improvements at the cost of the proposed private development. This would occur regardless of whether or not rezoning occurred in this transaction.
(d)
Should the proposed development for which a traffic impact study is submitted not be deemed necessary immediately (i.e., be warranted immediately) the installation of such signal, etc., shall not occur until such is warranted.
(e)
Developments of regional impact (DRI) mitigation installations listed in the final letter shall be required of the applicant at no cost to the city prior to the certification of occupancy for any of the related buildings.
