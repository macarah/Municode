ARTICLE IV. - TRAFFIC CALMING
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 48-235. - Policy; introduction.
(a)
In order to enhance the quality of neighborhood life and the safety of the city's residents, the public works department is establishing this traffic calming program. The goals of this program are:
(1)
Reduction of traffic speed to a safe and appropriate limit.
(2)
Encourage community participation.
(3)
Encouragement and enhancement of pedestrian, bicycle, and transit systems.
(4)
Limiting traffic calming to local residential streets.
(5)
Ensuring emergency vehicle access.
(6)
Use of effective, efficient, economical, and environmentally sound traffic calming solutions.
(7)
Multi-discipline input from engineers, planners, police, and fire.
(8)
Continued monitoring of speeds, traffic volumes, and accidents.
(b)
The public works department shall review applications submitted by neighborhoods, homeowners' groups or homeowners' associations ("applicants") for traffic calming measures in accordance with this article and the City of Milton Traffic Calming Policy and Procedures Manual as may be periodically amended.
(c)
It is critical to realize that the approach taken by the traffic calming program is a systematic one. While each situation may be somewhat unique, the same definitions and criteria, as outlined in this article, are applied. Also, the transportation system of the city should be considered as a whole. Solving one local problem should not cause another problem to appear somewhere else.
(d)
The traffic calming program is to be used only for local residential streets, as defined in section 48-237.
(e)
Keeping with the general guidelines and recommendations as set forth in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and Institute of Transportation Engineers aids in the recognition and understanding of traffic control devices. Standardization of these devices will help ensure that any given traffic calming measures including the use of speed humps will be equally recognizable and require the same action on the part of the motorist regardless of where they are encountered.
( Ord. No. 16-07-278 , § 1, 7-11-2016)
Sec. 48-236. - Traffic calming warrants.
(a)
For the purposes of the traffic calming program, a traffic calming measure may be warranted on a local residential street if any of the following are found during a traffic study:
(1)
Fifty percent or more of the total traffic is exceeding the posted speed limit; or
(2)
Pedestrian safety related problems, to include:
a.
A single instance or more of a vehicular/pedestrian accident;
b.
Inadequate road geometry rendering a roadway unsafe for pedestrian travel;
c.
A higher incidence of pedestrian traffic due to proximity to a school;
d.
Such other hazards to pedestrian traffic as are identified in a traffic study.
( Ord. No. 16-07-278 , § 1, 7-11-2016)
Sec. 48-237. - Local residential street defined.
The city shall only support the installation of traffic calming devices on local residential streets within the city. A local residential street must meet the following four criteria:
(1)
Those streets classified by the city as primarily used for direct access to property and connections to higher order systems;
(2)
Those streets where the adjacent land use is deemed residential in nature;
(3)
Those streets with posted speed limits of 25 m.p.h. or 30 m.p.h.; and
(4)
Those streets with an average daily traffic count of 400 to 4,000 vehicles per day (VPD). Volumes above 4,000 VPD would be considered a major road per the MUTCD for traffic control purposes, and volumes below 400 VPD would not typically provide enough benefit to warrant the expenditure of public funds for installation and the increased maintenance costs.
