Informal requests may be made verbally. The public will not need to make a formal request for copies or viewing of routine ordinances, resolutions, agendas, maps, and minutes. Upon receipt of the request, the city clerk will notify the appropriate department head/director by form ORR-1 for retrieval of information. When the requested information is compiled all information, along with form ORR-1, reflecting attorney review and approval, approval by the department head/director and an estimate of costs and time, will be submitted to the city clerk. The city clerk will certify the information, issue an invoice, and notify the requester to make arrangements for submittal of the information.
(b)
There is an exception to the formal request procedures in subsection (a) of this section. Standardized and routine open records requests, such as accident, incident, and miscellaneous reports and general research and analysis requests from the police and fire departments, will be received and handled by the police and fire departments. Additionally, open record requests pertaining to municipal court dispositions will be handled by the clerk of the court.
(c)
Whenever either type of request is received, the department head/director or designated person responsible for control of that information should ensure that the information is provided as quickly as possible. Within 48 hours the city clerk will be advised of requests which cannot be available to the requester within three business days from the date of receipt. The advisory will include a description of the records requested and a timetable for availability. The city clerk will provide a written notification of this information to the requester within 24 hours. In no event shall more than three business days lapse before a written timetable of inspection is provided to the requester from the city clerk, or the information is provided to the requester by the appropriate department head/director.
(d)
Exceptions to the open records law are provided in division 2 of this article. If there is a question as to whether or not information requested is subject to the open records law, the department head/director shall immediately contact the city clerk.

Departments should decide what hours to make documents available and monitor and supervise the inspection of approved records.
(b)
City employees do not have to prepare reports, summaries or compilations of public records not in existence at the time of the request.
(c)
Copies must be furnished, if requested, at a charge per page as established by the city council.

Subdivision I. - In General

Sec. 2-743. - Compliance with state public records act required.
In concurrence with state law, the city shall comply with the Georgia Public Records Act, as presented in O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq., for public entities.
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-744. - Purpose; statement of policy.
(a)
The city recognizes that its citizens have a right to expect, and the city has an obligation to maintain, an efficient and cost-effective records management program and it further recognizes the importance of city records in the lives of its citizens. The city has a responsibility to its citizens to manage, protect, preserve and make available city records.
(b)
It is the city's policy to provide for efficient, economical, and effective controls over the creation, distribution, organization, maintenance, use, retention, and disposition of all records of the city. This policy will be implemented through a comprehensive system of integrated procedures for the management of records from their creation to their ultimate disposition, consistent with the requirements of the Georgia Open Records Act, O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq., and accepted records management practice.
(c)
The decision to adopt the city's records management program is a commitment to improving the city's overall recordkeeping system. The city acknowledges that, while the utilization of retention schedules and micrographics may in fact delay the inevitable chaos that results from records mismanagement or nonmanagement, long-term benefits can be realized only through the introduction of a well-conceived, preplanned, comprehensive program that emphasizes the design, creation, use, maintenance and disposition of records.
(d)
All city records must be created, maintained, and disposed of in accordance with this article and all requirements, policies and procedures established pursuant to this article, and in no other manner.
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-745. - Records property of city; exceptions.
(a)
Every city record is the property of the city. No city officer or employee has any personal or property right to a city record even though they may have developed or compiled the record. The unauthorized alteration, destruction, deletion, removal, or use of a city record is prohibited. A city record exempted from public disclosure under state or federal law is not made subject to disclosure by its designation as city property under this section.
(b)
A city record may not be sold, loaned, given away, destroyed, or otherwise alienated from the city's custody unless in accordance with this article. This subsection does not apply to a city record that is temporarily transferred to a contractor for purposes of microfilming, duplication, and conversion to electronic media, restoration, or a similar records management and preservation procedure if the transfer is authorized by the records management officer.
(c)
Except when a city record is transferred into the archival custody of a records center, legal custody of a city record created or received by a department during the course of business remains with the director/division head. The legal custodian, as guardian of the record, does not relinquish responsibility for the care, preservation, or legal disposition of the record even though physical custody of the record for maintenance and preservation purposes may be held by another department or agency. The physical custodian of the record is also responsible for complying with all records management program requirements, policies, and procedures. An original city record may not leave the custody of the department concerned when it is being used by a member of the public.
(d)
Every official or employee shall deliver to any successor all city records pertaining to the office held by the city officer or employee. The legal and physical custody of a city record that has continuing historical value to the city may be transferred to the records center upon agreement between the director/division head and the records management officer. The records center's custody of the record subsequently will be known as archival custody, and ownership of the record remains with the city. The records center shall have legal and physical custody of all city records belonging to any defunct department that does not have a named successor.
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-746. - Password protected electronic records prohibited; exception.
Because all city records, including all electronic records, are public records, electronic records may not be password protected unless they are records specifically exempt from the open records law. Only confidential documents as specified in the open records law may be password protected as long as the creator of the document provides his or her supervisor with the password. Written confirmation from the supervisor shall be forwarded to the records management officer confirming the record is confidential. Such confirmation shall note the specific law that exempts the record from being an open record.
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-747. - Records involved in public information requests; requests by media; records pending litigation or audits.
The destruction of a city record involved in a pending request under the Public Records Act (O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq.), pending litigation or a pending audit, is prohibited, even if the destruction of the record is authorized by an approved records retention and disposition schedule. Retrieval and release of all records to the public or media shall be in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Public Records Act, O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq., and this article. All retrieval and release of records for litigation or media purposes shall also be in accordance with the advice and consent of the city legal department and city clerk's office.
