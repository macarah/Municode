DIVISION 2. - SIGNING
Subdivision I. - In General

Sec. 48-466. - General provisions.
(a)
All sign posts to be placed within a concrete area must have a six-inch wide diameter space through substructure.
(b)
The traffic control signs must be installed per the most recent edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) with relation to the installation height, size, distance from curb, etc. In general, signs should be installed at least seven feet but no more than ten feet from the ground to the bottom of the sign, and at least two feet from the face of curb to the closest edge of the sign, or as required by the MUTCD.
(c)
The signs shall comply with installation and material standards established by the public works department.
(d)
As part of the land disturbance permit process, the community development department will identify the number and location of signs. The minimum sign installation shall conform to the standards established in subdivisions 2 and 3 of this division.
(e)
The applicant will be responsible for maintaining the signs from installation to final inspection. The city reserves the right to replace stop or yield signs if they have been down for more than 12 hours, to replace any regulatory signs if they have been down for more than seven days, and to replace any other signs if they have been down for more than 14 days. This will be done at the cost to the applicant of $250.00 per sign.
(f)
The sign inspection shall be done by the community development department prior to acceptance of the final plat or as established by the community development department director. The signs should be performance bonded at the same time as the pavement at a cost of $100.00 per sign or as established by the community development department director. If the city needs to replace any signs at the time of the final inspection, the value would be forfeited.

Subdivision II. - Signs Installed in New Subdivisions

Sec. 48-486. - Stop signs (R1-1).
(a)
The stop sign shall be installed on the right side of the approach to which it applies. Stop lines, when used to supplement a stop sign, should be located at the point where the road user should stop. Where there is a marked crosswalk at the intersection, the stop sign should be installed in advance of the crosswalk line nearest to the approaching traffic.
(b)
Stop signs should be installed in a manner that minimizes the numbers of vehicles having to stop. In most cases, the street carrying the lowest volume of traffic should be stopped. A stop sign should not be installed on the major street unless justified by a traffic engineering study as recommended by the MUTCD. If two streets with relatively equal volumes and characteristics intersect, typically the direction that conflicts the most with established pedestrian crossing activity or school walking routes or the direction that has the longest distance of uninterrupted flow approaching the intersection should be stopped.
(c)
No all-way stops may be installed in a new subdivision without the approval of the public works director and shall be designed in accordance with the MUTCD, latest edition.

Speed limit signs shall indicate a 25 mph speed limit for streets internal to residential subdivisions, unless it is a local collector road for the development, and then it should be no higher than 35 mph. For neighborhood settings, only one speed limit sign shall be installed at each project entrance or at the points of change from one speed limit to another. This sign should be installed no less than 100 feet from the entrance of the subdivision, but no greater than 500 feet from the entrance.

If the street has no outlet, a "No Outlet" legend should be put on the end of the street name sign blade closest to the main road.
