All employees placed in new full-time and part-time positions must serve a six-month period of probation, except sworn police officers and firefighters who serve a 12-month period of probation. This applies to new hires, promotions and transfers.
(b)
The probation period is designed to give the employee time to learn the position and to give the supervisor time to evaluate the employee's potential and performance. During the established probationary period, the city reserves the right to terminate the probationary employee's service on the basis of unsatisfactory performance or on the basis of other reasons deemed sufficient by the city.
(c)
If an employee is unable to perform the work, the person must be terminated as early as possible. Early termination saves the city a time and dollar investment and saves the employee possible embarrassment and frustration. Rejected probationers shall be notified of such action in writing by the department head at any time during the probationary period and a copy of such notification shall be retained in the personnel files.
(d)
Recurring, periodic performance evaluations are required for all probationary employees in full and part-time positions as well as for sworn police officers and fire fighters. An evaluation is required at the 90-day interval of probationary employment for regular full and part time positions that must complete six months of probation. For sworn police officers and fire fighters who serve one-year probationary periods, an evaluation at the six-month interval is required. These periodic evaluations are designed to assess performance and advise the new employee of work expectations as well as any deficiencies in work quality and quantity. At the close of the probationary period, an employee is required to be evaluated for a second time, demonstrating their competency in fulfilling the requirements of their position and being released from probationary status.
(e)
Under unusual circumstances, the probationary period may be extended. This is only after an evaluation of the situation, the employee's abilities and demonstrated potential. Probation extension is done only upon recommendation of the supervisor, department head and approved by the city manager.
(f)
If the employee successfully completes the probation period, he shall be informed that he is now a regular employee. This will be accomplished by the city manager's office with the approval of the appropriate department head via the personnel action form.
(g)
When an employee first becomes a regular full-time employee, he becomes eligible for vacation and other appropriate leaves retroactive to the person's beginning date of employment. This is defined as six months for general employees and 12 months for sworn police officers and firefighters. Exceptions to this policy may only be approved by the city manager or his designee.
(h)
If an individual has been transferred or promoted, he remains eligible for all fringe benefits included with the previous position during the probation period for the transfer or promotion. If the position to which an employee has been transferred or promoted carries benefits different from those of the previous position, the person becomes eligible for the benefits of the new position upon the satisfactory completion of the probation period retroactive to the date of the transfer or promotion.
(i)
If an emergency arises during an employee's probationary period which requires a leave of absence, such time off, if granted, will not be considered as time worked.
(Code 1989, § 2-5-16; Ord. No. 04-04-13, 4-13-2004; Ord. No. 2008-0016, Exh. A, 7-28-2008; Ord. of 9-25-2017, Att. A)
Sec. 70-46. - Reemployment.
Any former regular employee who resigned from the city in good standing is eligible for reemployment. Persons interested in reemployment should file a completed city application form with the city manager's office. The individual will then proceed through the regular hiring procedures with other applicants. The date of hire will take the person's previous service with the city into account, however, future increases will coincide with the reemployment date. The individual's previous personnel file will be reactivated once reemployed by the city provided reemployment is within seven years after the original resignation. All individuals reemployed by the city must complete a new probationary period. Employees who are allowed to return to the same position they left within 30 days of departure may elect to bridge their service with leave time at the discretion of the city manager.

In certain situations, outside consultants may be contracted to assist with test development.
(b)
The department head shall ensure that all testing is based on bona fide occupational qualifications. The department head shall ensure that reasonable accommodations are made in test procedures to assure that persons with disabilities can be tested in an appropriate manner.

A drug and/or alcohol screening test based on reasonable suspicion can be undertaken in accordance with local regulations. All employees involved in a work-related incident causing personal injury or property damage may be tested promptly for drug and/or alcohol use in accordance with department policies.

If a holiday falls upon a Sunday, the following Monday shall be deemed to be the legal holiday. If the legal holiday falls on a Saturday, the preceding Friday shall be deemed to be the legal holiday.
(c)
To receive pay for an official holiday, the employee must either:

Employees working flexible hours who are not scheduled to work on the day of a holiday will not have their holiday hours included in any calculations of overtime. Rather, they will be paid holiday hours in the amount proportionate to their daily flex time work hours. For example, if an employee is scheduled to work four ten hour days and the following day off coincides with a council designated holiday, then the flex time employee will receive ten hours of holiday pay. For the non-exempt flex time employee who is scheduled to work on a holiday, the individual will be paid for the hours worked in addition to the holiday hours granted in a proportional manner to the normal daily flex hours. Only the hours actually worked will be eligible for inclusion in the calculation of overtime.

Firefighters and uniform sworn police officers (207(k) employees), and nonexempt employees that are not on flex schedules and authorized to work during any council designated holiday as defined in subsection (a) of this section, shall receive holiday pay for the council designated holiday at their normal hourly rates as well as pay for actual hours worked. Only the actual hours worked will be factored into the calculation of overtime pay. Holiday pay is not to be considered hours worked in the computation of overtime.
Holiday pay for fire—12 hours
Holiday pay for police patrol—12.25 hours
Holiday pay for police admin—8.5 hours
Holiday pay for general employees—8 hours
(f)
Any employee who has accrued holiday hours [shall use such holiday hours earned prior to using vacation hours.]

Sec. 70-244. - Grievance/appeals process.
(a)
The grievance procedure is established to provide opportunity to non-probationary employees to bring to the attention of management, situations that directly affect the employee's working conditions. It is the intent and desire of the city to adjust complaints or grievances informally, and both supervisors and employees are expected to make reasonable efforts to resolve problems as they arise. However, it is recognized that there will be grievances, which will be resolved only after an appeal and review. The submission of a grievance by an employee shall in no way adversely affect the employee or their employment with the city.
(b)
Only full-time and part-time employees who have completed the initial probationary period are eligible to file appeals or grievances under this procedure. Employees who are currently assigned to probationary periods based on promotion, demotion, or transfer who have completed the initial probationary period are considered eligible to file appeals or grievances under this section.
(c)
In order to assure non-probationary employees', a method by which the employee can get a particular grievance considered rapidly, fairly and without reprisal, the following steps are provided:
Step 1 — Supervisor
The aggrieved employee shall, within three working days of the incident, explain and discuss the complaint or grievance orally with the supervisor involved. Higher level supervision may be called into the discussion in an effort to achieve a prompt adjustment.
The supervisor will make a decision and notify the employee in writing within a reasonable time after discussion with the employee. Normally a reasonable time as used herein would be considered to be three working days. Circumstances may warrant a longer time frame. Ultimately, the city manager will determine whether the response was within a reasonable time.
The supervisor must provide the department director with a copy of the written decision.
Step 2 — Department Director
If the aggrieved employee feels that the matter has not been settled or adjusted to his/her satisfaction by the supervisor, they may submit the matter in writing to the department director within three working days from receipt of the answer in Step 1.
The department director or his/her designee, shall meet with the employee within a reasonable time. The department director or his/her designee will provide a written answer to the employee within a reasonable time.
The department director must provide the human resources director copies of all relating documents and the written decision in Step 2.
The department director at Step 2, is the final appeal level for all grievance and appeals other than adverse actions as defined in section 70-243(2), grievances involving sexual harassment; or grievances regarding actions under section 70-3, Discrimination which are herein referred to as "Appealable Grievances."
Step 3 — City Manager
If the aggrieved employee feels that an appealable grievance has not been settled or adjusted to their satisfaction by the department director, they may submit the matter in writing for review by the city manager. Requests to submit grievances or appeals to the city manager must be submitted to the human resources director within five working days from receipt of the answer in Step 2.
The city manager or his/her designee shall meet with the employee within a reasonable time after receipt of the grievance. The city manager or their designee will provide a written answer to the employee and the human resources director within a reasonable time.
Step 4 — City Council
If the aggrieved employee feels that the matter has not been settled or adjusted to their satisfaction by the city manager, they may submit the matter in writing for review by the city council. Requests to submit grievances or appeals to the city council must be submitted to the city clerk within five working days from receipt of the answer in Step 3.
The city council has the option to hear or decline to hear any appeal
(d)
Any grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of management's response at the completion of any step, unless it is appealed within the time limits set forth.
