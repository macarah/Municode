Sec. 26-12. - Minimum fines and costs (progressive fine system).
(a)
The minimum fine to be imposed upon any person convicted of an offense in the municipal court shall be $50.00, provided that person has not been convicted of a previous offense either within or without the city, within two years of the date of the offense. If a person has been convicted of one previous offense within two years of the date of the offense for which the city is imposing a fine, then the minimum fine shall be $100.00. If a person has been convicted of more than one offense in the two-year period prior to the date of the offense for which the city is imposing a fine, then the total number of such offenses shall be added to the offense for which the city is imposing a fine and multiplied by the minimum fine of $50.00 to determine the minimum fine to be imposed upon that person. For example, if a person had three prior convictions within the two-year period and was convicted of an additional offense, the minimum fine will be $200.00, or four times $50.00.
(b)
The minimum costs to be imposed for conviction of an offense shall be $10.00 for court costs. Five dollars of such costs shall be deposited into the police officer's annuity fund and $5.00 shall be retained by the city for its expenses incurred.

Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the discretion of the judge of the court to impose fines in excess of the minimum so long as such fines do not exceed the maximum allowed in this section.
