Editor's note— Ord. No. 05-03-22, adopted Mar. 22, 2005, did not specifically amend the Code. Therefore, at the discretion of the editor, these provisions have been included as Art. VII, §§ 2-451—2-453 to read as set out herein.

Sec. 2-451. - Authorized.
All sums due the city, including but not limited to ad valorem taxes, occupation taxes, fines, forfeitures, penalties, license fees, permit fees and registration fees, may be paid by the use of credit cards. The director of finance, with the approval of the city manager, shall establish the procedures for acceptance of credit card payments for amounts due the city.
(Ord. No. 05-03-22, 3-22-2005)
Sec. 2-452. - Discounted fees approved.
A credit card agreement made pursuant to this article may provide for the acceptance of the credit card payments from the credit card company at a discount from the face amount of the payment or for the withholding of administrative fees from the face amount of the payment. Such discounted fee is granted in exchange for the improved governmental cash flow, reduction of administrative expenses and increased public convenience as a result of credit card payments.
(Ord. No. 05-03-22, 3-22-2005)
Sec. 2-453. - Personal liability for final payment.
No person making payment by credit card to the city is relieved from liability for the underlying obligation except to the extent that the city actually receives final payment of the obligation in cash or its equivalent. If final payment is not made by the credit card issuer or other guarantor of payment in the credit card transaction, the underlying obligation for the money due is not extinguished. All applicable penalties, interest and collection fees on the unpaid amount shall be due from the person making the payment by credit card. Such penalties, interest and fees on an unpaid amount shall accrue from the date the unpaid obligation was first due under the applicable statute or ordinance. The city shall follow the collection procedures for the unpaid amount that would have otherwise been applicable had the credit card payment not been attempted.
