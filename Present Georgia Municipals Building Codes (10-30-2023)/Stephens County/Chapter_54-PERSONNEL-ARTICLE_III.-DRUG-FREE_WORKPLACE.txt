ARTICLE III. - DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE

Sec. 54-31. - Drug-free workplace policy.
Employees who abuse drugs and alcohol are not only a danger to themselves, but to fellow employees and the community served. In addition, medical costs incurred by employees with drug or alcohol problems are much higher than those of other employees, and the decreased productivity of these individuals due to absenteeism and turnover can adversely affect the County's ability to perform necessary services for its citizens.
It is the policy of Stephens County that its workplace shall be drug-free, in compliance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-690, title V, subtitle D). All employees are notified, and sign statements acknowledging such notification that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of controlled substance (defined in schedules I through V of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act 21 U.S.C. 812, and further defined in regulation 21 CFR 1308.15) is prohibited in the workplace. As a condition of employees, employees will:
(1)
Abide by the terms of this statement; and
(2)
Notify the county administrator of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days after such conviction.
Penalties for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace will include:
(1)
Taking appropriate personnel action, up to and including termination; and
(2)
Requiring the employee to participate satisfactorily in an appropriate drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program.
The county will provide a drug-free awareness program which is intended to inform employees about:
(1)
The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;
(2)
The county's intent to maintain a drug-free workplace;
(3)
Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs (the county is not required by law to pay for these services); and
(4)
The penalties that may be imposed upon employees for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace.
Copies of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 are available from the human resources office.
Stephens County's policy concerning the use of illegal drugs and abuse of alcohol applies to all employees on Stephens County's payroll, and is intended to protect the health and safety of county employees and the public. All employees and managers are required to join the County in implementation of this policy.
No part of this policy, nor any of the procedures hereunder, is intended to affect the county's right to manage its workplace or to discipline its employees; not [nor] is it a guarantee of employment, continued employment, or of any terms or conditions or employment. The county reserves the rights to interpret, change, modify, amend, or rescind this policy in whole or in part.
It is recognized that early treatment is the key to rehabilitation for substance abusers. Our policy is to assist employees with problems associated with abuse of drugs and alcohol, and to encourage rehabilitation. Employees are encouraged to voluntarily request help. No employee will have job security jeopardized by such a good faith request.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § C-1)
Sec. 54-32. - Drug-free workplace definitions.
For purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply:
(1)
Substance abuse is defined as:
a.
Reporting to work or working with drugs present in the body or while affected by alcohol;
b.
Chemical dependency on alcohol or other drugs where job performance or safety of employees is adversely affected; or
c.
The use of illegal drugs.
(2)
The term drugs present in the body means that the level of a drug found in an employee's blood, urine, or other body fluid exceeds those levels determined by the county and its testing laboratory as a cutoff level for a positive test.
(3)
The term affected is not limited to obvious impairment of physical or mental ability, such as slurred speech or difficulty in maintaining balance, but may be established by a professional opinion, a scientifically valid test, or by a layperson's observation.
(4)
The term illegal drugs as used in this policy includes, but is not limited to, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, or similar drugs whose possession or use is prohibited under state or federal law in this country, as well as prescription drugs unless validly prescribed by the employee's physician. So-called synthetic drugs, designer drugs, look-alike drugs, and similar substances are also considered illegal drugs for purposes of this policy, even if they are not specifically prohibited by state or federal law. This policy also applies to other substances which may be abused, whether available legally over the counter, such as cough syrup or drugs obtained with a valid prescription, or substances which were not intended for human consumption, such as glue.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § C-2)
Sec. 54-33. - Drug and alcohol testing of applicants.
Any offer of employment is contingent upon the applicant successfully completing the drug-screening test. No individual will be permitted to begin work until test results have been obtained. The county will not hire any applicant who:
(1)
Refuses to submit to a drug test;
(2)
Tests positive for use of illegal or unauthorized substances; and/or
(3)
Tests positive for the presence of prescription drugs that could impair their physical, mental, emotional, or other faculties (such as barbiturates, amphetamines, opiates, etc.) unless the applicant has a current prescription and a valid medical reason for the use of such drugs.
An applicant who is rejected under this policy may be considered for future vacancies if the applicant can demonstrate that they no longer use any such substances (for example, the applicant may successfully complete a drug abuse treatment program and pass a more thorough drug test, conducted at the applicant's expense).
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § C-3)
Sec. 54-34. - Drug and alcohol testing of commercial drivers.
Stephens County maintains a policy to comply with the department of transportation (DOT) requirements governing alcohol and drug testing of all drivers (and driver applicants) who operate a commercial vehicle in excess of 26,000 pounds. All county drivers who operate such a commercial vehicle, regardless of how often are subject to DOT alcohol and drug testing under this policy. All DOT-mandated tests are separate from and in addition to any drug tests which may be required by Stephens County in other instances.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § C-4)
Sec. 54-35. - Prohibited activities.
The following actions are prohibited for all employees:
(1)
The possession, use, transfer, manufacturer, or sale of alcohol, illegal drugs, or legal drugs without a valid prescription from a licensed medical or dental practitioner during working time, on county property, or while operating or riding in a county-provided vehicle, or any vehicle being used for county business, is prohibited. Obviously, this does not prevent county employees from possessing or transporting alcohol or illegal drugs as part of their job duties (such as a law enforcement officer who transports seized cocaine).
(2)
The possession or consumption of alcohol on county property or on county time, or while operating or riding in a county-provided vehicle, or any vehicle being used for county business, is prohibited.
(3)
Reporting for duty or working with drugs present in the body or while affected by alcohol will be handled through disciplinary procedures or referral for counseling or rehabilitation, as determined by management. This prohibition includes prescription drugs, unless the employee has a current legal prescription and a valid medical reason for using such prescription drug.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § C-5)
Sec. 54-56. - Notification procedure for authorized use of prescription drugs.
In order to assure that employees can safely perform their jobs, employees using prescription drugs according to a physician's instructions or using over-the-counter drugs for medicinal purposes should notify their supervisor or department head immediately upon reporting for work, in the event that such drugs could impair their physical, mental, emotional, or other faculties. Failure to do so may be considered a violation of this policy and is cause for disciplinary action.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § C-6)
Sec. 54-37. - Violations of drug-free workplace policy.
[Disciplinary action.] Employees who violate these prohibitions are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, depending on considerations such as nature of the offense, employee's current job assignment, employee's record with the county, and possible adverse consequence to the county. Any circumstances indicating a violation of federal, state, or local laws may be reported to appropriate law enforcement officials, and the county will cooperate in any criminal prosecutions.
Special provisions for employees operating county-provided vehicles, or personal vehicles on county business. Substance abuse by employees who operate county-provided vehicles or their personal vehicles on county business can create a very serious risk for both themselves and members of the public. The county believes employee behavior off the job can influence behavior on the job. Therefore, the following rules and disciplinary action will apply to those employees:
(1)
Employees who operate county-provided vehicles will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, for a conviction of driving that vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This provision applies regardless of whether the vehicle is being operated for personal or business use.
(2)
Employees who operate their personal vehicle on county business will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, for a conviction of driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs when the employee is operating that vehicle on county business. For purposes of this paragraph, "operating on county business" means that the employee would be entitled to reimbursement by the county for that specific trip.
(3)
Employees who operate a vehicle as an integral part of their job, such as county truck drivers, are subject to disciplinary action for a conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, even if such offense occurred in the employee's personal vehicle and not while on county business. The first such conviction subjects an employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The second such conviction in a 12-month period will result in termination of employment.
(4)
Any employees covered under the above provisions must report to their supervisor any citation alleging that they were driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, regardless of whether they offense occurred in the employee's personal vehicle, in a county-provided vehicle, or other vehicle, while on personal business or on county business. Failure to report any such citation may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The report must be made within five days of the citation, unless the employee is unable to make such report due to extenuating circumstances, in which case the notification must occur as soon as possible.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § C-7)
Sec. 54-38. - Searches.
Normal search practices that are part of a general security program, such as locker inspections, are not affected by this policy and may be continued or implemented as provided by such program.
When there is reason to believe that a specific employee or group of employees may be in possession of substances which are prohibited under the county's policy, the employee(s) may be required, as a condition of employment, to submit to a reasonable search of their clothing, personal lockers, desks, personal vehicles, purses, lunch boxes or other containers while on county property. Except in unusual circumstances, searches will not be conducted unless approved by the county administrator.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § C-8)
Sec. 54-39. - Drug and alcohol testing of employees.
The county may required an employee to undergo a medical examination and/or a drug/alcohol screening test under the following circumstances:
(1)
Accident or incident. An employee will be tested if:
a.
The employee is involved in an accident or incident which caused or could have caused personal injury to that employee or any other person;
b.
The injury was or could have been so serious as to result in lost time, the need for medical care by a physician, or serious property damage; and
c.
Action or inaction by the employee contributed to the accident or injury.
(2)
Reasonable suspicion or evidence of substance abuse. The county may determine to test an employee on the basis of reasonable cause or suspicion that the employee may be a substance abuser or in violation of the county's substance abuse policy.
(3)
Other instances. While it is not possible to list every factor which might lead to a decision to test, those listed below are representative of typical factors which may be considered:
a.
Excessive absenteeism or tardiness;
b.
Unexplained significant deterioration in job performance;
c.
Significant change in personality (repeated abusive behavior, insolence, misconduct, insubordination);
d.
Information from a credible source indicating possible substance abuse;
e.
Unexplained absences from normal work site;
f.
Patterns of work violations; unusual behavior which cannot be readily explained; changes in appearance or demeanor; excessive cravings for water or sweets;
g.
Reddened eyes or dilated pupils;
h.
Odor of alcohol or drugs;
i.

(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § C-9)
Sec. 54-40. - Drug testing procedures.
Except in unusual circumstances, before employees are requested to submit to a medical examination or drug/alcohol screening test, concurrence of the county administer [administrator] .
(1)
A testing request form will be completed.
(2)
The employee will be met with in private by his/her department head and the county administrator.
(3)
The employee will be asked to consent to any search, medical examination, and/or drug/alcohol screening test; will be asked to cooperate; and will be informed that submission to the search, examination, and/or screening test is a condition of employment. Failure to cooperate should result in immediate suspension without pay, and is grounds for termination of employment.
(4)
If the employee agrees to the examination and/or screening test, they will sign a release of liability form.
(5)
The department head, with concurrence of the county administrator, will make the decision concerning whether the employee will remain on the job until results of the examination and/or drug screening test are received. This decision will be based on their sole judgment as to whether the employee poses any danger to fellow employees or to the public, and based on the following categories:
a.
Employees tested for reasons associated with (a) safety-sensitive jobs, such as drivers of county vehicles, (b) voluntary requests for assistance, or (c) referral by the county for counseling or rehabilitation, may remain on the job pending receipt of the results of a drug screening test.
b.
Employees tested for reasons associated with (a) evidence of substance abuse, or (b) accident or injury, may remain on the job or may be suspended without pay pending receipt of the results of a drug screening test.
(6)
If an employee refuses to cooperate or to agree to the search, examination, and/or drug-screening test, the employee will be suspended without pay pending final decision regarding termination of employment.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § C-10)
Sec. 54-41. - Test results and subsequent actions.
(a)
[Procedures.] The following procedures pertain to conducting of tests, handling of test results, and actions to be taken after tests.
(1)
Collection of fluids. Procedures established by the county's designated testing laboratory and the county administrator will be followed for collection of sample body fluids. In situations where drug screen tests are administered pursuant to state/federal regulations, any procedure specified therein will be followed.
(2)
Negative test results. Negative test results will be communicated confidentially to the employee by the appropriate member of management.
(3)
Adulterated or unreadable samples. Adulterated or unreadable samples that are clearly not authentic will be considered as evidence of an employee's failure to cooperate with county policy. The employee will be given an opportunity to provide an explanation. If a satisfactory explanation is not provided, the employee is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
(4)
Positive test results. Positive test results may be confirmed by a second test of the original sample. The employee will be provided with the results of the test and given an opportunity to explain the result. If a satisfactory explanation is not provided, the employee will be disciplined and/or referred for appropriate counseling and rehabilitation, or employment will be terminated, as determined by the county. For positive test results, the employee may be offered an additional confirmatory drug test on the original sample, at the employee's expense. Arrangements for the confirmatory test should be made with the county administrator. A confirmatory test should be a second gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test performed on the original sample.
(5)
[Counseling.] In the case of positive test results, if the employee agrees to referral for counseling or rehabilitation, they should be advised that this counseling represents the final chance for assistance. If the employee refuses referral for counseling or rehabilitation, they will be suspended pending final actions or termination.
(b)
Failure of an employee to cooperate. Employee compliance with the county's program is a condition of employment. Failure or refusal of any employee to fully cooperate and participate in the program, to sign any required document, or to submit to a drug/alcohol test will be grounds for termination of employment, unless a compelling, satisfactory reason is provided.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § C-11)
Sec. 54-42. - Counseling or rehabilitation procedures.
Employees who continue employment while undergoing counseling or rehabilitation will be required to meet all established standards of conduct and job performance. Employees who have been referred for counseling or rehabilitation under this policy will be required to participate in and fully cooperate with their rehabilitation and with the recommendations of the program administrators. This may include the requirement for regular attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous or similar therapy sessions. Employee may be required to undergo drug/alcohol screening tests at any time during the course of the counseling or rehabilitation program, and thereafter for up to five years. If the county determines that an employee has failed to cooperate with rehabilitation under the terms of the county's policy, the employee will be suspended without pay, pending further investigation and final decision on disciplinary action.
(1)
Time off for counseling/rehabilitation. Work time lost will be paid according to eligibility for vacation leave.
(2)
Effect of a positive test after referral. After an employee has been referred for counseling or rehabilitation under the county's substance abuse program, the employee must promise to remain drug-free and/or alcohol-free as a condition of continued employment. A subsequent positive test will result in termination of employment.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § C-12)
Sec. 54-43. - Notification of convictions for drug-related crimes and sanctions.
The Federal Drug-Free Workplace Act imposes special requirements upon the county and its employees at facilities where work is performed under one or more federal government grants. Any employee at such a facility who is convicted of any criminal drug offense committed on county property or while on county business must notify the county of the conviction within five days of the conviction. Within ten days of being so informed by the employee, the county will, as required by the above federal laws, notify each federal government agency with which it holds an applicable grant and advise that the conviction has occurred.
