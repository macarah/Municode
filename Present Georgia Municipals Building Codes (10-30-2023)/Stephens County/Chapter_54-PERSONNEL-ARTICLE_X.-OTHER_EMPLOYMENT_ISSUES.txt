All outgoing messages which do not reflect the official position of the county must include the following disclaimer. "The opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Stephens County government." Internet users are advised not to use the Internet for any purpose that would reflect negatively on the county or its employees.
Employees may find some information on the internet offensive or otherwise objectionable. Individuals should be aware that the county has no control over and, therefore, cannot be responsible for the content of information available on the internet.
