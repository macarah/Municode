The inspection shall be allowed as soon as reasonably possible.
(7)
If the clerk of the board of commissioners determines that the requested inspection involves records which are not open for public inspection, the clerk shall advise the person making application that the application will be referred to the board for determination as to whether or not the inspection will be allowed.
