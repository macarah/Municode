The state has enacted through law (O.C.G.A. § 38-3-57) that all local public safety and emergency response organizations, including emergency management agencies, law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and emergency medical services, shall implement the standardized unified incident command system and that those agencies that do not establish such system shall not be eligible for state reimbursement for any response or recovery related expenses.
