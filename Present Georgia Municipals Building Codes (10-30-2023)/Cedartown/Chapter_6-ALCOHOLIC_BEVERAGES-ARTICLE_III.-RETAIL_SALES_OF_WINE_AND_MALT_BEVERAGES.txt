It is prohibited for the manager, or any employee, to allow such persons to gather outside and consume alcoholic beverages.
(c)
No retail consumption licensee shall permit, encourage or induce any employee or agent to solicit the purchase by a patron of any drink, whether alcoholic or nonalcoholic; or try to solicit money to insure that patrons must participate in the consumption of such beverages through promotions, discounts, or contests. Further, no licensee shall pay a commission or other compensation based solely on the frequency in which a patron purchases beverages while on the premises.
(d)
No retail consumption licensee shall permit excessive noise that can create a breach of the peace, a disturbance, or otherwise may be distinctly heard beyond the physical boundaries of the property upon which the license is granted.
(e)
No patron of any establishment which allows on-the-premises consumption under a proper license from the city shall be permitted to bring any form of wine, beer, liquor or other alcoholic beverage, onto the premises in any cooler, container, or other carrying device.
