Sec. 94-635. - Purposes.
This article is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the city, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the city so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the city as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this article shall:
(a)
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities in the city;
(b)
Protect the city's structures and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities;
(c)
Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
(d)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennas failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennas;
(e)
Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city;
(f)
Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and
(g)
Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-636. - Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
Accessory structures means any structures or components used in direct support of a telecommunications facility.
Antenna means any exterior apparatus designed for the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves for telephonic, radio, television, or personal wireless services. For the purposes of this article the term "antenna" does not include any tower and antenna under 30 feet in total height which is owned and operated by an amateur radio operator licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, any device designed for over-the-air reception of radio or television broadcast signals, multichannel multipoint distribution service or direct broadcast satellite service, or any cable television headed or hub towers and antennas used solely for cable television services.
Building inspector means the building inspector for the City of Cedartown.
Governing body means the city commission for the City of Cedartown.
Macro telecommunications facilities are those which are located on existing buildings, poles or other existing support structures and which project more than three feet above the top of the structure but no more than ten feet above the roofline, parapet or top of the structure. Macro telecommunication facilities may exceed the height limitation specified for the zoning district.
Micro telecommunications facilities are those which are located on existing buildings, poles or other existing support structures where antennas do not project more than three feet above the top of the structure and there are no more than six antennas per site.
Monopole tower means a telecommunications tower consisting of a single pole, constructed without guy wires or ground anchors.
Telecommunications facilities refer to antennas and towers, either individually or together.
Tower means a structure, such as a lattice tower, guy tower, or monopole tower, constructed as a freestanding structure or in association with a building, other permanent structure or equipment, on which is located one or more antennas intended for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication. The term includes microwave towers, common carrier towers, and cellular telephone towers.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-637. - Exclusions.
The following shall be exempt from this article:
(a)
Any tower and antenna under 30 feet in total height which is owned and operated by an amateur radio operator licensed by the Federal Communications Commission;
(b)
Any device designed for over-the-air reception of television broadcast signals, multichannel multipoint distribution service or direct broadcast satellite service; or
(c)
Any telecommunications facilities located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the city provided a license or lease authorizing the telecommunications facility has been approved by the governing body;
(d)
Any cable television headers or hub towers and antennas used solely for cable television services.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-638. - Placement of telecommunications facilities by zoning district.
(a)
In light industrial (IND-L) and heavy industrial (IND-G) zoning districts, micro and macro telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use by right. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least one user are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 80 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least two users are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 100 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least three users are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 120 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector.
(b)
No telecommunications facilities shall be permitted in any residential areas.
(c)
Telecommunications facilities outside the guidelines listed above may only be built after approval of a variance granted by the building inspector.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-639. - Colocation; preferred and disfavored location sites.
(a)
[Parameters.] All applicants shall make a reasonable attempt to colocate on existing towers, buildings, or other tall structures. Furthermore, applicants shall be willing to allow other uses to colocate on the proposed tower site in the future, subject to engineering and feasibility factors, frequency considerations, and proper compensation from the additional user. Such compensation shall be determined from average lease rates paid by the applicant for comparable colocation sites in Polk County and contiguous counties, to be provided by the applicant. Such information shall, however, remain confidential and shall not be disclosed by any city official.
(b)
Preferred location sites.
(1)
Co-location sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site, provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this article and co-location sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the building inspector or the governing authority to be visually obtrusive.
(2)
Publicly-used structures. Publicly-used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly-used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly-used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches.
(3)
Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roof line can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility.
(4)
Mixed use buildings in high density districts. Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites.
(c)
Disfavored location sites. Any single-family, multifamily, or neighborhood commercial structure or site shall be disfavored sites for the location of telecommunications facilities.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-640. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities.
(a)
General requirements for all telecommunications facilities. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this article.
(1)
Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the building inspector, within 30 days after the inspection. Failure to provide said reports could result in revocation of any permits or licenses previously granted to the owner by the city.
(2)
Regulatory compliance.
a.
All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations.
b.
Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months to the building inspector. Failure to provide this information could result in revocation of any permit or license previously granted to the owner by the city.
(3)
Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility.
(4)
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the building inspector may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
(5)
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities.
(6)
Visual impact.
a.
Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background.
c.
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
d.
Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic structures as designated by the commission or by any state or federal law or agency.
e.
Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view, made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures, or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained by the owner of the telecommunications facility.
(7)
Landscaping.
a.
Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property, to the extent feasible.
b.
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing any existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that which is removed.
c.
The building inspector may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived in the discretion of the building inspector.
(8)
Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street.
(9)
Principal, accessory and joint uses.
a.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility.
b.
Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area.
(10)
Lot size and setbacks.
a.
The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities, provided however, that the building inspector may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this article would be better served thereby.
1.
Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure.
2.
Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements.
3.
Telecommunications facilities must be setback from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on an engineer's analysis.
b.
For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact and said placement is approved by the building inspector.
(b)
Additional requirements for towers.
(1)
Site location and development shall preserve the existing character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zoning district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
(2)
Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area.
(3)
At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(4)
Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable.
(5)
When a tower is adjacent to a residential use and located on the ground, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance at least equal to its total height.
(6)
In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district.
(7)
Towers shall not be placed where they will negatively affect historic districts or buildings as designated by the commission or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
(8)
Towers shall be enclosed by opaque or solid decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access.
(9)
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design, landscape, and placement requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
(10)
The building inspector shall have the discretion to waive the requirements of this subsection where exact compliance would interfere with the function or purpose of a tower, or where compliance would place an unreasonable burden on an owner.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
