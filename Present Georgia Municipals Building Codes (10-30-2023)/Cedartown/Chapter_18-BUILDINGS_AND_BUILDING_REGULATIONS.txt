Building permit means the written document authorizing the construction of works of improvements, alterations or other construction activities concerning any movable housing, as defined in this section, within the city.
Movable housing means any house, dwelling, building or other structure (not a manufactured home as defined in O.C.G.A. § 8-2-131(3)) which has been extracted from its foundation or other permanent location by means of dollies, jacks or other devices so as to be made portable, movable or otherwise subject to being transported or hauled; when in fact the structure was not constructed or designed for that purpose.
Moving permit means that written document required to authorize the moving, transportation or relocation of any movable housing either within or without the corporate limits of the city.
(Code 1969, § 5-86)

In addition thereto, the movers shall deposit with the issuing authority of the city an amount as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges for each such movable housing structure to be transported either within or without the city, as a bond for damages to public property. This sum shall be returned to the mover within 15 days after such moving if no damage is done to public property.

Sec. 18-115. - Standards for review of issuance of permit.
The building inspector of the city is charged with the authority for the enforcement of this article. As such, in determining whether to issue a moving permit, he shall use the following criteria:
(1)
No permit for movable housing shall be issued until notice of an application for a permit, to be made on forms approved by the city, has been given to the owners of all adjoining property upon which the building or structure is to be moved. Each adjoining property owner, including those adjacent to the property and across the street directly therefrom, shall be allowed to be heard before the building inspector before the granting of a permit occurs.
(2)
Whether the proposed housing can be properly brought to the level of minimum standard requirements contained in the building code of the city, and as generally required pursuant to the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 8-2-1 et seq. The aforesaid provisions of state law generally deal with the construction or alteration of buildings. Those sections of this Code or state law applicable to movable housing shall be used as criteria for determining the feasibility of issuing a permit to the applicant.
(3)
Whether the structure, when complete, will have a fair market value which is not less than 80 percent of the assessed fair market value of adjoining comparable properties, for tax purposes, in the general vicinity and neighborhood within the city where this structure is to be located. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the structure's presence in the area will not diminish property values.
(4)
Whether the structure can safely and properly, using reasonable construction standards and those contained in this Code, be properly placed upon the property, constructed, repaired and maintained as a residential dwelling unit fit and safe for occupancy by the general public.
(5)
Whether the placing of a movable housing structure, together with all work or other construction to be accomplished in the vicinity of the property will create a health, safety or public hazard or nuisances within the corporate limits of the city. In determining whether the conditions could constitute a nuisance, the building inspector shall consider the criteria contained in section 38-61.
(6)
Whether the applicant has, within five years before the date of the application, had a building permit revoked, failed to comply with code standards and requirements of the building inspector or otherwise been cited for significant violations of the building codes and ordinances of the city.
(Code 1969, § 5-90)
Sec. 18-116. - Permit not transferable, subject to denial, revocation, suspension or amendment.
(a)
A permit, once issued, may not be transferred from one person to another, or from one licensed location for the moving of a structure contemplated by this article to another location, without the express written consent of the building inspector having been first obtained.
(b)
The building inspector shall have full power and authority to deny, revoke, refuse to grant, suspend or amend, as might be needed, any moving permit to be granted under this article.
(c)
Since the criteria and establishment of this permit also requires later enforcement and compliance with this article, this permit and the accompanying building permit shall be subject to revocation for cause.
(d)
Before taking any action adverse to an applicant or permit holder, the building inspector shall conduct a hearing at which all interested parties may be heard concerning the grant, renewal, refusal or suspension of any license privileges granted under this article. Appeal of any decision of the building inspector shall be to the city commission.
(Code 1969, § 5-91)
Sec. 18-117. - Hearing.
Upon written application within 30 days of the decision of the building inspector, any applicant or other party aggrieved by any decision pursuant to this article shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the city commission. At that time the aggrieved party shall be allowed to present evidence, cross examine opposing witnesses, or present any and all documentation concerning the application or decision. Failure to make timely appeal of the decision within the time period shall cause the decision to become final and unappealable. The hearing shall be conducted within 30 days from the date of a timely application and the final decision of the city commission in this regard shall be accomplished in writing and communicated to the aggrieved party. The review before the city commission shall be conducted pursuant to the criteria contained in this article for review by the building inspector, and shall be considered a de novo consideration of the decision.
(Code 1969, § 5-92)
Sec. 18-118. - Penalty.
Any person found in violation of any of the provisions of this article shall be subject to punishment as contained in section 1-13.
