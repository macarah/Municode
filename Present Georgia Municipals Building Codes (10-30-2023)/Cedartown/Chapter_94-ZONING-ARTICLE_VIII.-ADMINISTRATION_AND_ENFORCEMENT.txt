In Article 7, entitled "Administration and Enforcement", division 3 of Article 7 involves the board of adjustments and section 94-262 creates officers and meeting requirements of the board. These sections are hereby abolished and deleted.
Section 2. All references in the zoning ordinance, (Chapter 94) or any other areas of the code of ordinances of the City of Cedartown to the "Board of Adjustments" are deleted and abolished, it being the intention of this ordinance to allow the planning commission, already created by the city, to act in connection with all matters which could formerly have been construed to be within the jurisdiction and responsibility of the board of adjustments. Hereafter, any and all jurisdiction and authority previously vested in the board of adjustments, shall after the effective date of this ordinance, be fully and conclusively vested in the Cedartown Planning Commission.
Section 3. Further evidencing the intention of the city commission as set forth in section 2 hereof, section 94-263, 94-264, and all matters concerning appeals and hearings as contained thereafter shall be incorporated into, and be vested fully, with the Cedartown Planning Commission to use said procedures, hearings and standards as might be applicable in its deliberations of handling all appeals to be conducted under the Code of the City of Cedartown for matters of zoning, building enforcement, variances, and related powers and duties.
Section 4. In accomplishing the intention of the commission, the codifiers of the city code, being Municipal Code Corporation, may merge, consolidate, or delete duplicating sections for hearings and appeals as might exist within Divisions 2 and 3 of Article VII. However, the powers and duties of administrative review, special exceptions and variances as contained in Section 94-263 shall be saved from repeal, and shall be fully vested in the planning commission, together with the standards for decisions on zoning matters as contained in section 94-264 of the code, which are also saved from repeal."
