The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
(2)
In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued by him unless a variance is granted pursuant to this article.
(k)
Variance. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions, or to interpret the meaning of the provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgement, best fulfill the purpose of this article.

(Code 1969, § 17-43)
Sec. 54-64. - Philpot historic district enterprise zone.
(a)
[Designation.] In accordance with the amended urban redevelopment plan, the Georgia Enterprise Zone Employment Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-88-1 et seq. (hereinafter "The Act"), the Georgia Department of Community Affairs or the Georgia Department of Revenue, the city hereby designates the Philpot Street enterprise zone within the Cedartown Urban Redevelopment Area. This zone meets the qualifications and criteria of the Act due to the existence of the following:
(b)
Pervasive poverty. Within the Philpot historic district enterprise zone, including adjacent Census tracts and block groups as identified by the U.S. Bureau of Census (2000), there are high levels of persons with an income to poverty ratio less than 1.0. Individual block groups within the Census tracts adjacent to this area suffer from poverty levels above 15 percent thus qualifying the area as a poverty area under O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6(b)(2).
(c)
Under development. The area within the Philpot historic district [enterprise] zone is severely underdeveloped as compared with other areas of the city. Most of the structures within this area are dilapidated and many are empty. Such disrepair and inactivity satisfy the criteria of O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6(e).
(d)
General blight. The proposed enterprise zone is within an approved urban redevelopment area as amended; thus, the criteria of O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6(f) demonstrating blight.
(e)
Legal description. The area to be included in the Philpot historic district enterprise zone is specifically described as follows:
Beginning from a point located at the intersection of the centerline of East Avenue and the centerline of South Philpot Street, extending south along the centerline of South Philpot Street to the south property line of lots abutting the south right-of-way of Herbert Street; thence in an easterly direction along that south property line of lots abutting the south right-of-way of Herbert Street to the centerline of Park Street; thence extending north along the centerline of Park Street to centerline of Noyes Street; then proceeding east along the centerline of Noyes Street to the rear property line of lots abutting the east right-of-way of Park Street; thence north along that rear property line of lots abutting the east right-of-way of Park Street to the centerline of East Avenue; then west along the centerline of East Avenue to the beginning at the intersection with the centerline of South Philpot Street.
