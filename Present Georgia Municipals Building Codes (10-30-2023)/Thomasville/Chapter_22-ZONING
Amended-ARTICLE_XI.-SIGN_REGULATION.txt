ARTICLE XI. - SIGN REGULATION

Sec. 22-464. - Findings.
After extensive research, study and deliberation, the city council has determined:
(1)
Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable, orderly and safely designed business environment, the protection of property values and the promotion of tourism in this unique community;
(2)
An improperly regulated sign environment poses health and safety hazards to the public;
(3)
The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion and visual clutter caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicle traffic;
(4)
Through proper regulation of signs, the attractiveness and economic well-being of the city will be enhanced as a place to live, work, and conduct business;
(5)
The city derives substantial revenue from tourism centered around the historic character of the city and its surrounding plantations and area attractions; preservation of the city's historic character is necessary to protect and foster future tourism;
(6)
The following local sources, in particular, comprise appropriate background for the regulation of signage within the city:
a.
The 2005 Thomas County/Thomasville Comprehensive Plan;
b.
The 2009 Victoria Place Urban Redevelopment Plan;
c.
The 2007 US 319 and US 84 Corridor Study;
d.

(7)
Specific study of US 319 and US 84 corridors was performed for the city by the Florida Planning and Development Lab of Florida State University, Department of Urban and Regional Planning, dated September 2007. The study found that additional restrictions were needed on signage in the US 319 and US 84 urban corridors.
(8)
The following non-local sources, in particular, comprise appropriate background for the regulation of signage within the city:
a.
Signs, Billboards and Your Community, a Citizen's Manual for Improving the Roadway Environment by Effective Control of Billboards and Outdoor Advertising, by the Pennsylvania Resources Council Inc. and Society Created to Reduce Urban Blight;
b.

Some signage has a single targeted function and identification of signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of identifying addresses, which is a benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Signs at the entrances to neighborhoods and major developments favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage may be referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this article, the provisions of this article are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.
( Ord. No. 06-04122021 , § II(22-311), 4-12-2021)
Sec. 22-465. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
The purpose and intent of this article is to establish standards for the fabrication, erection, use, maintenance and alteration of signs within the city. These standards are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of persons within the city by providing regulations which allow and encourage creativity, effectiveness, and flexibility in the design and use of such devices while promoting traffic safety, protecting property values, and avoiding an environment that encourages visual blight.
(b)
The standards established by this article are designed to maintain the economic viability of businesses in our community through the availability of appropriate signage as well as promote the efficient transfer of public and commercial information through sign management.
(c)
It is also the purpose of this article to prohibit the future erection, placement, or location of portable and certain other types of signs determined to be detrimental to the aesthetic sense, historic character and public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, both generally and as it particularly affects tourism.
(d)
A determination has been made by the city council that the regulations contained in this article are the minimum amount of regulations necessary to achieve the purposes set out above. Therefore this article must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this article is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding must not affect the validity of other provisions of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provision.
(e)
These regulations are not intended to and do not apply to signs erected, maintained or otherwise posted, owned or leased by the state, the federal government, or this city. The inclusion of government in describing some signs does not intend to subject the government to regulation, but instead helps illuminate the type of sign that falls within the immunities of the government from regulation.

For all signs, the sign face of which does not exceed 32 square feet or the height of which does not exceed six feet, permits may be issued to the owner or owner's agent without designation of a licensed contractor. Any sign exceeding those dimensional requirements, with the exception of wall signs painted on an exterior wall and banners, shall require designation of a licensed contractor to perform the erection and/or installation. Sign permits are authorizations granted to a specific applicant and are nontransferable. The sign permit holder shall remain responsible at all times for the erection, maintenance and condition of the sign. Once signs have been erected pursuant to valid permits, the sign permits are transferable only to a new owner or agent who succeeds to the legal interest of the former sign permit holder; no transfer of the sign permit shall be complete without application to and approval by the city.

(e)
Multi-tenant signs. For multi-tenant signs, the property owner shall secure a permit for the sign structure. The property owner shall remove individual sign panels in accordance with section 22-482(c). In addition to the permit required for a multi-tenant sign structure, a separate permit shall be required for each panel of the multi-tenant sign.
(f)
Insurance for certain signs. No permit for a sign that extends over a public right-of-way shall be issued until the owner or person in control of such sign shall have obtained liability insurance in the sum of $1,000,000.00 for property damage for any one claim and public liability insurance in an amount not less than $1,000,000.00 for injuries, including accidental death to one person, insuring the municipality against all loss, costs, damages, personal injury or expenses incurred or sustained by or recovered against the city by reason of the construction or maintenance of such sign. The certificate of insurance shall state that the city is an additional insured and that the insurance carrier will notify the city 30 days in advance of any termination or restriction of coverage. The provisions of this section shall not apply to signs not requiring a permit under this article (see section 22-468).
(g)
Fees. Permit fees shall be collected at the time of permit issuance. Fees for permits shall be fixed from time to time by the city council.
(h)
Review of application; issuance of permit. Upon the filing of an application for a sign permit, the zoning administrator shall review all information supplied, all plans and specifications submitted, and the premises upon which the sign is proposed to be erected. Such review shall be completed within 30 calendar days of submission of a sign application. If, based on review of the permit application and inspection of the site, the proposed sign is in compliance with the requirements of this article and all other laws and ordinances of the city, the zoning administrator shall issue a permit upon payment of all fees. Application packages submitted in an incomplete form shall be returned to the applicant with denial based upon incompleteness of the application. If no decision is made within 30 calendar days, the permit will be deemed approved, provided that any sign erected must comply with all size, height, location and other physical requirements of this article, and no vesting of rights for a sign in violation of the standards shall occur.
(i)
Denial of permits; revocation. The city shall deny permits to applicants who submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this article, are incomplete, or contain any material or false statements. Violation of any provision of this article will be grounds for terminating a permit granted by the city for the erection of a sign. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that the permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this article, the zoning administrator shall revoke the permit. Should the zoning administrator deny a permit, the reasons for denial shall be stated in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application on or before the 30th calendar day after the city received the application. Alternatively, the city may personally serve the sign applicant with a copy of the written notice of denial within 30 calendar days after the city's receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, instead of on the date of original submission. Actions to revoke a permit shall be in writing, shall document the basis for the revocation, and shall be served in the same manner as a notice of denial.
(j)
Expiration of permits. A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been erected, installed or affixed within six months after the date of issuance. No refunds will be made for a permit after the permit is issued. If, later, a sign is desired to be erected at the same location, a new application for the sign must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule applicable at such time.
(k)
Appeals. An individual whose permit application has been denied or a permittee whose written permit has been revoked may appeal the decision to the sign appeals panel, provided the appellant files a written notice of appeal with the city clerk within ten business days of the zoning administrator's notice. Such appeals shall be considered by the sign appeals panel in a hearing held within 30 days of the notice of appeal being filed. In hearing an appeal under this article, the sign appeals panel shall be bound by the standards contained in this article in all respects. At the hearing, the appellant shall have the right to introduce evidence, may testify, may be represented by counsel, and may cross- examine witnesses. The burden of supporting the decision of the zoning administrator rests with the zoning administrator. The sign appeals panel will tape record the appeal proceedings. The appellant has the right to supply a court reporter at the appellant's own expense, if desired. The sign appeals panel shall reach its decision within 14 calendar days after hearing. If no decision is made within 45 days of appeal filing, the appeal will be deemed to overrule the zoning administrator's decision. Decisions of the sign appeals panel to affirm the decision of the zoning administrator or to overrule the decision of the zoning administrator shall be reduced to writing and served upon the applicant in the same manner as the original notice from the zoning administrator. The members of the sign appeals panel shall elect a chairperson. The three members of the sign appeals panel shall constitute a quorum and shall be authorized to conduct the business of the sign appeals panel pursuant to this article. The affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the sign appeals panel shall be required in the conduct of the business of the sign appeals panel and for any action of the sign appeals panel; provided, however, in connection with hearing and deciding appeals brought before the sign appeals panel pursuant to this subsection and/or section 22-483, the city manager, or the city manager's designee, shall vote only in order to break a tie. Notwithstanding, the city manager or the city manager's designee, shall otherwise sit as a member of the sign appeals panel and vote with respect to all other matters or decisions that may come before the sign appeals panel.
(l)
Further review by certiorari. In the event an applicant whose permit has been denied or a permit holder whose permit has been revoked is dissatisfied with the decision of the sign appeals panel, such applicant or permit holder may petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court of the county as provided by law.

a.
Sign copy mounted, affixed or painted on a background panel or surface distinctively painted, textured, or constructed as a background for the sign copy, is measured as that area contained within the sum of the smallest rectangle that will enclose both the sign copy and the background. See figure 1 at the end of this subsection (a).
b.
Sign copy mounted as individual letters or graphics against a wall, fascia, mansard, or parapet of a building or surface of another structure, that has not been painted, textured, or otherwise altered to provide a distinctive background for the sign copy, is measured as the sum of the smallest rectangle that will enclose each word and each graphic in the total sign. See figure 2 at the end of this subsection (a).
(2)
Two-faced signs.
a.
If the interior angle between the two sign faces is 45 degrees or less, the sign area is of one sign face only. See figure 3 at the end of this subsection (a).
b.
If the angle between the two sign faces is greater than 45 degrees, the sign area is the sum of the areas of the two sign faces. See figure 3 at the end of this subsection (a).
(3)
Three- or four-faced signs. The sign area is 50 percent of the sum of all areas of all sign faces. See figure 3 at the end of this subsection (a).
(4)
Free-form or sculptural signs. Spherical, free-form, sculptural or other non-planar sign area is measured as 50 percent of the sum of the areas using only the four vertical sides of the smallest four-sided polyhedron that will encompass the sign structure. See figure 3 at the end of this subsection (a).
Figure 1, Sign Area equals A x B
Figure 2, Total Sign Area equals A+B+C
Figure 3 (5 as 1)
(b)
Height measurement. Sign height is measured as the vertical distance in feet from the ground, sidewalk or other surface to the highest point of the sign face or sign structure, whichever is higher. Where the ground is uneven, the average elevation is utilized to determine the starting point of the measurement.

( Ord. No. 06-04122021 , § II(22-329), 4-12-2021; Ord. of 09-26-2022(2) , § IV)
Sec. 22-482. - Maintenance; appearance and inspection of signs.
(a)
All signs shall be maintained in good condition so as to present a neat and orderly appearance. The zoning administrator or the zoning administrator's designee should endeavor to periodically inspect each sign in an attempt to ascertain, in the zoning administrator's discretion, whether the same is secure or insecure and whether it is in compliance with the requirements of this article or in need of repair. Responsibility for the safety of signs and security of their attachment or erection remains at all times with the sign owner.
(b)
In order to ensure that signs are erected and maintained in a safe and orderly manner, the following maintenance requirements shall be observed for all signs, and any deficiency shall be corrected within 30 working days of being detected:
(1)
No sign shall have more than ten percent of its surface area covered with disfigured, cracked, ripped or peeling paint or poster paper;
(2)
No sign shall stand with visible rust, bent or broken sign facings, broken supports, loose appendages or struts or be allowed to stand more than 15 degrees away from the perpendicular;
(3)
No sign shall have weeds, trees, vines or other vegetation growing upon it or obscuring its view from the street from which it is to be viewed; and
(4)
No interior illuminated sign shall stand with only partial illumination.
(c)
When a commercial entity ceases operation, all signs related to that entity shall be removed or neutralized within 30 days from the date of discontinuance of the use. Sign cabinets and structures to which another sign face may ultimately be attached can conform to this requirement by:
(1)
Painting over the existing sign with a color that harmonizes with the building;
(2)
Removing sign pan faces and replacing them with blank panels; or
(3)
Placing a fitted sign wrap over the cabinet that completely obscures the underlying sign face, is fitted snugly over the existing cabinet, is secured and has no loose or hanging ties, ropes or supports.

(a)
The provisions of this article shall be enforced by the zoning administrator, with the aid of code enforcement, as well as other city agencies.
(b)
Any person who erects or maintains a sign on private property or a sign in the public right-of-way in violation of this article shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of up to $150.00 for each violation and revocation of all sign permits issued to such person. Each day a sign is posted in violation of this article shall constitute a separate violation.
(c)
The zoning administrator shall have full authority to remove, without notice to the owners thereof, and impound for a period of five business days:
(1)
Signs located on public rights-of-way except signs erected by the jurisdiction controlling the right-of-way;
(2)
Signs located on city property that are attached to or painted on any telephone pole, light pole, telegraph pole, other than signs erected by the owners of such poles and required for identification or access;
(3)
Signs attached to or painted on any tree, rock, or other natural object located on city owned property. All signs impounded may be reclaimed by paying an impoundment feeof $30.00 per sign. Signs not reclaimed within five days may be disposed of. In the prosecution for the violation of this article's prohibition against signs in the public right-of-way, the fact that a person, a product, or a place of business is advertised on a sign shall be prima facie evidence that the person advertised, or the proprietor of the product advertised, or the proprietor of the place of business advertised, as the case may be, was the person directing the placement of the sign in question.
(d)
The zoning administrator may institute removal procedures after due notice for any sign that shows gross neglect, becomes dilapidated, or is otherwise in violation of this article.
(e)
The zoning administrator shall cause to be removed any sign that endangers the public safety, such as abandoned, dangerous or materially, electrically or structurally defective signs or a sign for which no permit has been issued or which is otherwise in violation of this article.
(f)
The zoning administrator shall prepare a written notice which shall describe the sign and specify the violation involved and which shall state that if the sign is not removed or the violation corrected within a reasonable period of time specified in the notice, not to exceed 30 days, the sign shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of this section, the owner thereof shall be subject to revocation of all sign permits for the location of the violation, shall be liable for a fine of $150.00 for each violation, and that each day a sign is posted in violation of this article shall constitute a separate violation.
(g)
All notices mailed by the zoning administrator shall be sent by certified mail and first-class mail. Any time period provided in this section shall be deemed to commence on the date of the receipt of the certified mail or, if the first class mail is not returned, after three days of mailing. Alternatively, notice may be personally hand-delivered to the sign owner, and notice shall be effective on such date of hand delivery.
(h)
The notice shall be mailed to the owner of the property on which the sign is located, the owner of the sign if different than the property owner, and the occupant of the property. If any such person is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be mailed to such person's last-known address, if any, and posted on the sign or on the premises.
(i)
Any person having an interest in the sign or the property may appeal the determination of the zoning administrator ordering removal or compliance by filing a written notice of appeal within ten business days after receipt of notice.
(j)
Appeals of decisions by the zoning administrator, including, but not limited to, orders to repair or demolish signs, or denials of administrative adjustments, shall be taken to the sign appeals panel by filing a written notice of appeal within ten business days of the zoning administrator's decision. The appeal hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set out in section 22-467(k). Any subsequent appeal shall be taken as provided in section 22-467(l).
(k)
In the event no appeal is filed, or an appeal is filed and final determination has been made, all signs for which notice of removal or notice to take corrective action has been given shall be removed or brought into compliance within the original time period specified in the notice or within five business days after final determination by the sign appeals panel, provided that where permanent signs are installed, the time period may be extended for up to two weeks by the zoning administrator where removal requires engagement of a sign contractor or other specialized expertise; and provided further that a sign that constitutes an imminent hazard to life may be removed by the city pursuant to subsection (l) of this section without further delay.
(l)
Any sign removed by the zoning administrator pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become the property of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city. The cost of removal of the sign by the city shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recoverable in the same manner as city property taxes. The cost of removal shall include any and all incidental expenses incurred by the city in connection with the sign's removal.
(m)
When it is determined by the zoning administrator that the sign would cause imminent danger to the public safety, and contact cannot be made with the sign owner or property owner, no written notice will have to be served. In this emergency situation, the zoning administrator shall document the imminent danger and the zoning administrator's attempts to contact the sign owner and property owner, and may correct the danger, all costs being charged to the sign owner and property owner.
(n)
If it is necessary for the zoning administrator to remove the sign pursuant to the provisions of this section, and it should be practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in the removal, the zoning administrator may sell the same at public or private sale at the best price obtainable and shall keep an account of the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be used to offset the cost of removal to be charged to the sign owner or property owner. Where the proceeds derived from such a sale are less than the cost of removal, such deficiency shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located, such lien to be collectible in the same manner as city property taxes.
(o)
In the event any sign regulated by this article is erected, constructed, altered, converted or used in violation of any provision of this article, the zoning administrator, police, or code enforcement may, in addition to other remedies, and after due notice to the appropriate person, issue a citation for violation of this article, requiring the presence of the violator in the municipal court.
(p)
The zoning administrator may also institute action for injunctive relief or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, alteration, conversion or use or to correct or abate such violation.

Sec. 22-485. - Administrative adjustments.
(a)
No adjustment shall be allowed from any dimensional, material, structural, or durational requirement of this article, except that the zoning administrator may grant an administrative adjustment of up to ten percent from the dimensional standards of this article, provided the resulting signage is consistent with the purpose of this article, and the proposed adjustment will account for decreased effectiveness clearly resulting from:
(1)
Natural conditions;
(2)
Lot configuration;
(3)
The presence of easements or rights-of-way; or
(4)
A threat to public safety.
(b)
