ARTICLE II. - ALARM SYSTEMS

Sec. 12-19. - Purpose.
The city council has recognized a continuing problem with an inordinate number of unfounded calls for service, as that term is defined in section 12-20, initiated by the activation of burglar alarm systems located at businesses and private residences within the city, causing interference with other duties of police officers and resulting in high costs to the city. There is hereby adopted by the city council this chapter to establish rules, regulations and penalties in connection with the use of burglar alarm systems in order to cause a reduction in the number of unfounded calls for service, to make more efficient the city police department's ability to respond to burglar alarms, and to reduce the likelihood of police officer or citizen injury as a result of the emergency responses engendered by burglar alarms.
(Code 1991, § 12-26; Ord. of 3-9-1987, § III)
Sec. 12-20. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Alarm system means any mechanism or device which is designed to automatically transmit to the police department, fire rescue department, or receiving station a signal, message, warning or other indication of any occurrence requiring police or fire rescue department response.
Alarm system business means any person who installs, services or responds to electrical, electronic or mechanical alarms, signal devices, burglar alarms, fire alarms, television cameras or still cameras used to detect fire, burglary, breaking and entering, shoplifting, pilferage, theft, or any other intrusion. However, it shall not include a business which merely manufactures or sells alarm systems unless such business installs, services, or responds to alarm systems at the protected premises. Further this definition does not include a person who owns and installs an alarm system on property owned or leased by that person.
Alarm system user means any person in control of any building, structure or facility wherein an alarm system is installed, operated and maintained.
Local alarm system means any mechanism or device which, when activated, causes an audible or visual signal or both to be activated only in or on the premises wherein the system is installed, operated, and maintained.
Response means the dispatching by the city of personnel and equipment to the scene upon activation of an alarm system.
Unfounded call for service means the activation of an alarm system eliciting a response by police or fire rescue department when a situation requiring such response does not in fact exist. The term "unfounded call for service" includes accidental, avoidable or unnecessary alarm system activation due to alarm system user error, equipment malfunction, or improper or unsuitable equipment, but does not include an alarm system activation caused by acts of nature, electrical power surges outside the alarm system or other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm system user or alarm system business.
Unfounded calls for service day means the 24-hour period of the calendar day during which the unfounded call for service is made.
(Code 1991, § 12-27; Ord. of 3-9-1987, § III)
Sec. 12-21. - Certain alarm systems prohibited.
It is unlawful to install, operate or maintain an alarm system that transmits directly to a police or fire rescue department telephone number by way of telephone line, especially through an automatic continuous dialing device, a signal, message, warning or other indication of an occurrence requesting police or fire rescue department response. The owner or lessee of any such alarm system in operation on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall disconnect or have disconnected such alarm system or be in violation of this section.
(Code 1991, § 12-28; Ord. of 3-9-1987, § III)
Sec. 12-22. - Unfounded calls for service.
Responsibility for unfounded calls for service under this article shall be borne by the alarm system user for each of the user's separate alarm systems. For each response by the city police or fire rescue department to any unfounded call for service, the alarm system user shall be subject to the following regulating procedure:
(1)
There shall be no fee charged for the first two unfounded calls for service days within the period of any one calendar month. For any person who maintains an alarm system at each of two or more separate locations, the provisions of this subsection shall apply to each separate location. For all succeeding responses to unfounded calls for service to premises within the same one-month period a fee, as provided in the city fee schedule, shall be charged for each such response. The determination of whether an unfounded call for service has taken place shall be made by the chief of police or chief of the fire department and there shall be no appeal from this determination.
(2)
Where a determination has been made that an unfounded call for service has taken place, the chief of police or chief of the fire rescue department shall notify the alarm system user in writing of the fee assessed for the unfounded call for service. The notification shall be sent by regular U.S. mail to the alarm system user at the address maintained by the police department for the alarm system user. Upon a failure of a user to pay any fee specified in subsection (1) of this section within ten days after the date of the written notification of the fee assessed, the deputy city marshal shall draw a fi. fa. against the delinquent user in the past due amount, and collect same after proper levy, advertisement and public sale.
(3)
The provisions of this section shall also apply to those alarm system users whose alarm systems are not connected directly to a monitoring device at the city police department or fire rescue department but are instead connected to a monitoring device maintained by an alarm system business. If an unfounded call for service is received by the city police department or fire rescue department by way of call from an alarm system business, then it shall be treated the same as an unfounded call for service received by way of input directly to the monitoring device at the city police department or fire rescue department. Upon a failure of such an alarm system user who fails to pay any fee specified in subsection (1) of this section within ten days after the date of the written notification of the fee assessed, the deputy city marshal shall draw a fi. fa. against the delinquent user in the past due amount and collect same after proper levy, advertisement, and public sale.
(Code 1991, § 12-29; Ord. of 3-9-1987, § III)
Sec. 12-23. - Information to be provided by alarm system users.
Each alarm system user who operates an alarm system within the city shall list with the police department and fire rescue department the names, addresses and telephone numbers of at least two persons who can be notified to turn off, repair or service the alarm including a local alarm system and secure the premises during any hour of the day or night that the alarm may be activated. In addition, each alarm system user shall provide the police department with the user's current mailing address for the purposes of notification as referred to in section 12-22.
(Code 1991, § 12-30; Ord. of 3-9-1987, § III)
Sec. 12-24. - Discontinuance.
After March 9, 1987, the city will accept no new lines into the alarm system monitoring device located at the city police department, except such lines as may be required by law. As lines are removed from that monitoring device through actions of alarm system users or otherwise, the city police department will accept no lines to replace those so removed, except such lines as may be required by law. Effective July 1, 1992, the city police department shall discontinue monitoring alarm systems through the monitoring device referred to herein or through any other monitoring device, except as such monitoring may be required by law, and any such monitoring device, except as required by law, shall be removed from the city police department as soon as practicable after that date.
