No alcoholic beverages shall be manufactured or warehoused except under license granted by the city council as provided in this article, but the properly licensed sale of such alcoholic beverages is hereby declared lawful.
(b)
Each application provided for in this article shall be considered and passed upon by the city council in regular or special session, legally assembled. No license shall be granted to any person unless it is made to appear to the city council that the applicant is a suitable and fit person to carry on such business, and that the business will be conducted in an orderly manner and in compliance with all laws, municipal, state and federal. Upon approval of the application and payment of the required license fee, the applicant shall be entitled to the issuance of the license; provided, however, the council reserves the right to approve such issuance of the license conditioned upon full and final compliance by the licensee with all applicable city ordinances.
(Code 1991, § 3-21)
Sec. 3-28. - Disqualification provisions.
When contrary to the public interest and welfare, no original application shall be considered and no license to sell alcoholic beverages of any kind shall be issued by the city council to or for:
(1)
Any person as determined by the city council by reason of such person's business experience financial standing, moral character mental capacity, trade associations, personal associations, record of arrest, or reputation in any community in which the person has resided, who is not likely to maintain the operation for which the person is seeking a license in conformity with federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations.
(2)
Any person who shall have been convicted or who shall have entered a plea of nolo contendere, or forfeited a bond, to any felony within a period of ten years immediately prior to the filing of any such application, or to any misdemeanor within a period of five years immediately prior to the filing of any such application, for any felony or misdemeanor of any state, or of the United States, or any municipal ordinance except a traffic violation not involving a DUI, particularly, but not limited to, those involving force or violence, prostitution, alcoholic beverages, gambling or tax law violations, if such conviction, plea or forfeiture tends to indicate that the applicant will not maintain the operation for which the person is seeking a license in conformity with federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations. The term "conviction" includes an adjudication of guilt or plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere or the forfeiture of a bond by a person charged with a crime. Notwithstanding this provision, the city council, in their sole discretion, may direct the issuance of a license to persons who have in the past been convicted of, or plead guilty to, or entered a plea of nolo contendere, or forfeited a bond on any crime, and the city council, after a thorough investigation of all the facts, including parole or probation officer's reports, judge's recommendations, and any other evidence bearing on the character of the applicant, have determined that such action is in keeping with the public good and ends of justice, or the public interest and welfare.
(3)
A location not suitable in the judgment and discretion of the city council because of traffic congestion, general character of the neighborhood, or by reason of the effect which such an establishment would have on the adjacent and surrounding properties, or on the neighborhood.
(4)
A location at which a previous alcoholic beverage license has been revoked or suspended, and where, in the judgment of the city council, the problems which have arisen from the operation of an alcoholic beverage license at such location indicate that it is not in the interest of public health, safety, welfare or morals that the sale of alcoholic beverages be permitted at such location.
(5)
Any person who is an elected official (or that person's spouse) of, or employee (or that person's spouse) of, the city.

Failure of any holder of a license to sell alcoholic beverages to file the application for renewal by the date and time specified shall render the license void, effective the last legal hour on December 31 of that year for such sales. In order to sell alcoholic beverages a license holder who has allowed the license to lapse shall file a new application for license as if a license had never been held and pursuant to the provisions of this article. Where an application for renewal is timely filed as provided in this article, the license holder shall be permitted to continue selling alcoholic beverages under the previous year's license until the city council has acted upon the license holder's application for renewal. Wholesale sales of alcoholic beverages in the city by wholesalers licensed by the state are hereby declared legal, subject to the right of the city to charge a wholesaler for violation of state law or regulation, and to request a hearing thereon before the state revenue commissioner.
(c)
No person, or the person's spouse, who has a direct financial interest in a license for the sale of alcoholic beverages at wholesale shall hold any license or have an interest in any other license issued under the terms of this chapter.
(d)
The city clerk shall cause an inquiry to be made into the records of the city to determine if any applicant or other parties interested in an application have any outstanding taxes or special assessments that are delinquent or any other moneys owing to the city. No license shall be issued, nor shall a license be renewed until all such debts are paid in full.
(e)
All applications required by this chapter shall be investigated by the city police department and the report of investigation presented to the city council for consideration with the application.

Sec. 3-31. - Penalties, suspension; revocation; denial of renewal or transfer.
(a)
Notice, hearing. Any license which has been applied for or which has been issued or which may hereafter be issued by the city to a licensee may be denied, suspended, revoked or transfer refused, as applicable, by the city council pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. In the event the city council shall deny any application for a license or for the transfer of any license, or shall revoke or suspend any existing license, the applicant or licensee shall be given notice in writing from the city clerk with the reasons for the actions stated and which notice shall be mailed or delivered to the applicant. Within 15 business days of the date of the notice of the action denying any application or suspending, revoking or refusing the transfer of any license, the party affected shall have the right to give notice in writing to the city council of a request for a hearing with respect to the action taken by the city council. Thereafter, and within 30 days of the notice of the application for hearing by the applicant or the licensee, the city council shall set a hearing for the party affected. The hearing provided for in this section need not be at a regular meeting of the city council but may be at such time and place as shall be fixed by the city council in the notice given to the applicant or licensee; provided that at any hearing as provided for in this section, the party afforded the hearing shall have the opportunity to present evidence, to cross examine opposing witnesses, to have an attorney present to represent the party's interest, and to have testimony recorded at that party's expense.
(b)
Due cause generally.
(1)
Due cause for the suspension, revocation or denial of the renewal or transfer of any license shall consist of an act or omission found to be by the city council, after a hearing as above provided, a violation of any law or ordinance regulating such business, or violation of regulations made pursuant to authority granted for the purpose of regulating such business, or for the violation of any state or federal law, or for the violation of any city ordinances, other than traffic violations or ordinances, or failure of the licensee or the licensee's employee to promptly report to the police department any violation of the law or ordinance, breach of peace, disturbance or altercation, resulting in violence occurring inside the premises.
(2)
Due cause may also be found should the licensed establishment have become a trouble spot in the judgment of the city council by reason of disturbances or acts of disorderly conduct or violence having occurred in the establishment or on the premises thereof, provided that when the license of any establishment has been revoked or renewal of license denied because such establishment has become a trouble spot, no further license shall be issued under this chapter to any person, firm or corporation at such location for a period of at least 12 months from the date of revocation.
(3)
Due cause shall also consist of the business or the operation or location thereof, or the owner or any person connected therewith, ceasing to meet any of the qualifications for the issuance of license as stated in this chapter.
(4)
Due cause may also be found upon the revelation of any false statement or material misrepresentation in any application hereunder. Any material omission from or untrue or misleading information which is contained in an original, renewal or transfer application for license hereunder shall be cause for the denial or refusal of a license, and if any license has previously been granted under such circumstances, the same shall constitute due cause for revocation of such license.
(5)
Failure to control operation resulting in public nuisance. If the failure to control the operation either inside the building or outside on the property results in controlled substance abuse, prostitution, gambling, flagrant indecent conduct or obscenity, fighting, excessive noise, loitering or illegal parking, to the number of times and extent that the city council, after proper hearing, should find the establishment to have become a public nuisance, then such failure may be declared to be due cause for suspension or revocation of the alcoholic beverage license for such establishment, or the denial of renewal application for such license.
(c)
Emergency due cause; failure or refusal to cooperate with the city police acting in line of duty. On evidence of failure or refusal of the licensee or employee hereunder to cooperate with any police officer on any reasonable request or action within such officer's duties, responsibilities or powers, including all police powers, rights and duties to investigate to determine any pertinent fact relating to the establishment, the licensee, any employees or corporate officers or partners, the chief of police shall immediately order all sales of any alcoholic beverages suspended until after a hearing as set out in the due cause hearing provided for in subsection (a) of this section, such hearing to be concerning such failure or refusal to cooperate.
(d)
Refund of license fee. When a license is so revoked or suspended, the city shall not be required to refund any portion of the license fee.
(e)
Effect of revocation by state. Whenever the state shall revoke any permit or license to sell any alcoholic beverage at retail, the city license to deal in such product shall thereupon be automatically revoked without any action by the city council or any municipal officer. If the state has suspended the license or placed such license on probation, then the city license is automatically suspended or probated, as the case may be.
(f)
Emergency situation. The mayor is the delegated authority to suspend any license hereunder in any emergency situation, and such suspension may be made effective immediately and remain in force until the next regular or called meeting of the city council. In addition, in any emergency situation, the chief of police is hereby authorized to cause the business in question to close temporarily until the mayor decides the emergency or possible riotous situation to be at an end, or until such decision is made by the city council at its next regular meeting, whichever occurs first.
(g)
Penalties for sale of alcoholic beverages to underage persons. Upon receipt of information by the city council that a sale of alcoholic beverages to an underage person has taken place by a license holder, including the license holder's agent or employee, the license holder shall be given notice in writing from the city clerk to show cause before the city council at a time and place specified therein not less than three days no more than ten days from the date of the service of the notice why a penalty should not be accessed against the license holder. At the appointed time and place the license holder shall have an opportunity to show cause, if any exist, why the license holder should not be penalized for the sale of alcoholic beverages to an underage person. At any hearing as provided in this subsection, the license holder shall have the opportunity to present evidence, to cross examine opposing witnesses, to have an attorney present to represent the license holder's interest, and to have testimony recorded at the license holder's expense. Thereafter, the city council shall take such action as it, in its judgment and discretion, shall deem warranted under the facts, and if a determination is made that the license holder or license holder's employee has sold alcoholic beverages to an underage person, the license holder shall be penalized according to the following schedules:

(h)
Conditions under which a suspended license may be reinstated.

(1)
At a public hearing at a regular council meeting, the licensee shall be reminded of the problems and infractions which originally resulted in the suspension of the license;
(2)
Upon the assurance of the licensee that the problems for which the license was originally suspended have been corrected and that no other problems will occur upon reinstatement, council may reinstate the license on a provisional basis for a probationary period of up to six months:
a.
If, during the six-month probationary period, there is no incident which council, in its discretion, deems significant, and if all else is in order concerning the operation of the licensed establishment, council may reinstate the suspended license with no conditions or with such conditions as the council deems appropriate.
b.
If, however, during the six-month probationary period there is any incident which council, in its discretion, deems significant, council shall have the option to continue the probationary period, to suspend the license again, or to revoke the license, following a hearing conducted pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section.

(c)
Nothing in this section, however, shall prohibit one or more of the partners in a partnership holding a license from withdrawing from the partnership and assigning the partner's interest in such partnership to one or more of the partners who were partners at the time of the issuance of the license. Such withdrawal shall not, however, serve to bring any new ownership into the partnership, unless all provisions of this section are fully complied with, and then only upon the approval of the city council.
(d)
Any change in the ownership interests contained on the application shall cause the immediate cessation of sales of any alcoholic beverages and no sales of alcoholic beverages shall be made until any such change in the ownership interests are approved by the city council; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply in a situation where one or more individuals who have ownership interests in the license cease to have such ownership interest, but the remaining ownership interest remains unchanged except as to the division of the remaining interests.
(e)
Should a transfer of the location be desired, the location shall meet all requirements of a new license to be issued hereunder, except payment of the license fee. The investigation fee will accompany the application and the unearned portion of the license fee may be transferred to the new location in the event the transfer of location is approved by the city council.
(f)
