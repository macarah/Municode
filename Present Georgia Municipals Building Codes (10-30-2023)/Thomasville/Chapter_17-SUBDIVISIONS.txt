All legal lots must front on a public street.
Planning and zoning commission means the city planning and zoning commission.
Street means a way for vehicular traffic, whether designated as an avenue, boulevard, road, highway, expressway, lane, alley, or other way. The term "street" is divided into the following categories (see Illustration 1 on file in city, Ordinance Book 5, page 22):
Alley means a minor way used for service access to the back or side of properties otherwise abutting on a street.
Collector street means a street within a subdivision used to carry traffic from the minor streets to the major streets and includes the principal entrance and circulation streets of a subdivision, and those streets designated as collector streets on the street and traffic plan of the city.
Cul-de-sac means a minor street with only one outlet, sometimes called a dead-end street.
Major streets means those streets designated on the street and traffic plan of the city as regional thoroughfares, major thoroughfares, secondary thoroughfares and collector streets.
Marginal access street means a minor street parallel and adjacent to major streets and which provides access to abutting properties with protection from through traffic.
Minor street means a street used primarily for access to the abutting properties.
Subdivider means the person having such a proprietary interest in the land to be subdivided as will authorize the maintenance of proceedings to subdivide such land under this chapter, or the authorized agent of such person for the purpose of proceeding under this chapter.
Subdivision means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, legacy, or building development, and includes resubdivision and, where appropriate to the context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or area subdivided; provided, however, that the following are not included within this definition:
(1)
The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots are equal to the standards of the municipality;
(2)
The division of land into parcels of five acres or more where no new street is involved;
(3)
The division of land into three parcels or fewer where no new street is involved and the resultant lots are equal to the standard of the municipality or county in which the division of land is being made, provided sufficient land has been deeded to the city to provide an adequate right-of-way on the existing street involved according to the standards of the city's street and traffic plan.

(3)
Paving with curbs and gutters. The subdivider shall grade, pave and construct street paving, with curb and gutter, in accordance with current city specifications. All plans shall be drawn, and paving done, in accordance with a typical section approved by the city engineer. All paving work is to be inspected during all phases of the work by an official representative of the city engineer. The construction staking shall be done by the subdivider's engineer and at the subdivider's expense. Standard paved drives and all necessary street drainage, including storm sewers outside the street right-of-way, shall be constructed by the subdivider, at the subdivider's expense, in accordance with city regulations and standards, as determined by the city engineer.
(4)
Strip paving. When, in the sole judgment of the city council, unusual conditions exist that make the cost of construction of streets with curb and gutter exorbitant or clearly not in the public interest, then, and only then, may the city council permit the subdivider to construct strip paving in lieu of construction required by subsection (3) of this section.
(5)
Storm drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided by the subdivider. The plan for such drainage shall bear the stamp of a registered professional engineer. The plan must be approved by the city engineer and shall be based upon the following criteria:
a.
Storm sewers and/or ditches shall be designed to carry not less than the storm- water from a rainfall expected to occur once in 25 years with a runoff factor of 85 percent for pavements and buildings, 20 percent for sandy soil, and 40 percent for soil with clay subgrade or surface.

All pipes installed shall be class III reinforced concrete pipe, except where pipes larger than 36-inch diameter are required; approved corrugated metal culverts or bridges may be installed. No wood bridge will be allowed. Corrugated metal pipe shall be asphalt coated and invert paved and be the gauge as recommended by the manufacturer for installation involved.
e.
Endwalls or inlets, whichever is appropriate, shall be constructed on the ends of all pipes installed under the provisions of this article. The endwalls and inlets shall be placed and constructed in accordance with the then current city standards used in the design and the construction of other street improvements projects (street paving).
f.
Wherever streets are strip paved, all ditches that are over three feet deep (with reference to the shoulder) will be culverted and catchbasins installed not more than 100 feet apart in accordance with city engineer requirements.
g.
All ditches shall be dug with a minimum grade of five-tenths percent, and a maximum of six percent.

k.
Ditches shall be dug to a minimum depth of 18 inches where driveway culverts will be replaced. The construction will be supervised by the city engineer and must be approved by the city engineer.
(6)
Sanitary sewers. The subdivider shall install sanitary sewers in accordance with standards adopted and prescribed by the city engineer; however, the city council, in its sole discretion, may waive the requirement that sewers be installed when it is the judgment of the city council that such installation is prohibitively costly to the subdivider. In instances where the city council waives the installation of sanitary sewers, the subdivider, as a condition precedent to the acceptance of the subdivision by the city, must provide easements for the later installation of sanitary sewers. Extension of the sanitary sewer system within a new development will be the expense of the developer. Extensions to the development that may result in other service opportunities may be credited or provided by the city as evaluated for each new development. Whenever a private sewage-disposal system or septic tank or both shall be constructed for the securing of any establishment, such construction shall be performed to meet the requirements of Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. ch. 511-3-1, On-site Sewage Management Systems, of the Rules of the Georgia Department of Public Health, in effect at the time of construction.
(7)
Water mains and fire hydrants. The subdivider shall install water mains and fire hydrants in accordance with standards adopted and prescribed by the city engineer. Extension of the water system within a new development will be the expense of the developer. Extensions to the development that may result in other service opportunities may be credited or provided by the city as evaluated for each new development.
(8)
Gas mains. The subdivider may elect to install gas mains, in accordance with standards adopted and prescribed by the city engineer. Extension of the natural gas system within a new development will be the expense of the developer.

(9)
Improvements or bond. Before consideration of a final plat of a subdivision, the planning and zoning commission must be satisfied that all improvements required by this chapter have been constructed. In lieu of the completion of the improvements, the applicant shall file with the city a surety bond conditioned to secure the construction of the improvements required by this chapter in a manner satisfactory to the city and within a period of time not to exceed one year from date of approval of the final plat; provided, however, that the planning and zoning commission shall have authority to extend such period of time not to exceed three years. The amount of the bond shall be in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimated cost of the construction of the improvements required by this chapter, such estimate to be made by the city engineer. The surety will be subject to the condition that the required improvements will be completed within 12 months after approval of the final plat, and if they are not completed, the city may proceed with the work and hold the applicant and the surety jointly and severally responsible for the costs thereof. Such bond shall be executed by a corporate surety company authorized to do business in the state, holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States as acceptable sureties on federal bonds, and executed and issued by a resident agent licensed and having an office in the state, representing such corporate surety. As an alternative to the surety bond, the applicant may deposit with the city a certified check made payable to the City of Thomasville or issue a letter of credit to the city from a financial institution approved by the city manager, such letter of credit to be in a form approved by the city attorney. The amount of the certified check or letter of credit shall be the same as would otherwise be required for the surety bond as set forth above.
