The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections 1005.4(b) and (c) of this ordinance shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 1005.4(c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;

(i)
Stream crossings for water lines; or
(ii)
Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:

Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
c.
The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015, if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
d.
Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land-disturbance activities.
(d)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit.
(e)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Section 1005.4(b) and (c) of this ordinance.
1005.5 Application/permit process.
(a)
General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal of the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.
(b)
Application requirements.
(1)
No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the building department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable.
(2)
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the building department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 1005.5(c) of this ordinance. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 1005.4(b) and (c) of this ordinance will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three full-size printed copies and one 8Â½" Ã— 11" reduced copy of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, and an appropriate and properly filled out Georgia EPD Erosion Sedimentation & Pollution Control Plan Checklist. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10.

A fee, shall be charged in the amount set forth in the current city fee schedule.
(4)
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-8(a), one-half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to subsection O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(5)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 34 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 1005.4(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid and bonding, if required as per subsection 1005.5(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
(6)
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may require a bond as outlined in subsection 1005.5(b)(7) of this ordinance prior to approving the permit application.

Sec. 1006. - Drainage.
(a)
Policies. It is hereby declared to be public policy to:
(1)
Recognize the necessity of joint action where feasible by the city and the development industry in resolution of existing drainage problems and prevention of their worsening or recurrence.
(2)
Work in a cooperative relationship with the development industry to accomplish the above-stated objective by encouraging through this section and other public actions; the development of fewer but larger major stormwater facilities; and the incremental resolution of existing drainage problems on a priority basis in concert with private development activities.
(3)
Preserve, where feasible, the natural environment of city streams through reduction of flow quantities resulting from new development, and where feasible, restore the floodplain to its natural functional purpose to resolve existing flooding problems, but recognize the necessity of using urban streams for water runoff in those situations where preservation of the natural stream environment would result in continuation or worsening of flooding conditions.
(4)
Incrementally assume maintenance responsibility for the public drainage system on lands accepted by the city.
(5)
Require of the development industry the responsibility to maintain the functioning of the storm drainage system during the development process.
(6)
Encourage the construction of joint stormwater ponds serving several residential properties which can be accepted for maintenance by the city upon completion of project development. The city encourages (where engineering judgment so warrants) the location of these stormwater facilities off the site of the property under development and may participate where it is in the general public's best interest in the construction of major stormwater facilities which would serve not only the needs of the property under development, but would assist in resolving existing flooding problems.
(7)
Encourage innovative design solutions to the effective control of runoff.
(8)
Encourage accommodating runoff from residential properties or between individual single-family lots through underground piping rather than open surface drainage swales.
(9)
Minimize cross drains from streets to natural drainageways by longitudinal piping or by retaining within the streets, for as long a reach as commonly accepted standards of engineering judgment permit, runoff to a point of discharge not directly onto individual single-family lots.
(b)
Standards.
(1)
All engineering design items for storm drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation control, and delineation of the intermediate regional floodplain shall meet the applicable minimum requirements of the Stormwater Design Manual and the Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Georgia, available for review in the office of the city engineer. Rainfall intensities used in hydrologic computations shall not be less than shown by applicable rainfall curves published by the National Weather Service for the affected area.
(2)
A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all development and construction disturbing more than 5,000 square feet of land or involving the installation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious surfaces. This storage and release requirement shall not apply to individual single-family lots of less than two acres which are not a part of a platted subdivision.
(3)
The release rate of stormwater from all developments, where controlled release is required, shall be determined according to the requirements of the Stormwater Design Manual.
(4)
The following requirements shall apply to the installation, development and maintenance of all stormwater and sedimentation control facilities designed for storage of stormwater runoff:
a.
In residential subdivisions, these facilities shall be located on tracts of land, designated as city-owned greenbelt on the recorded plat, with sufficient area around the perimeter to provide access for maintenance purposes and shall be immediately adjacent to or be provided with an access easement to a public street. The access easement shall provide at least ten feet of width outside of above-ground obstructions including trees, headwalls, weirs, settling basins or other drainage structures.
b.
Except as provided in (4)c., the property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of the stormwater facilities during grading, construction, and following final approval of the completed project. This maintenance obligation shall be binding on future owners, successors and assigns of the property and be in accordance with all provisions of the Water Resource Protection Ordinance.
c.
In the case of platted residential subdivisions, the city shall assume maintenance responsibility after the release of the maintenance agreement for subdivision streets. Upon completion of the maintenance agreement, all stormwater ponds shall have a positive slope to the outlet in order to facilitate complete drainage.
(5)
Special drainage system maintenance requirements:
a.
No impoundment of water which retains in excess of 0.5 acre-foot of runoff shall be altered without first obtaining a development permit, which shall only be issued after competent engineering studies provided by the developer show that this removal will not adversely affect downstream properties.
b.
Trash, garbage, construction materials, construction by-products or other debris shall not be deposited in any part of the drainage system.
c.
No restrictions or barriers, including fences, may be placed in the drainage system without first obtaining a development permit.
(6)
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

Sec. 1007. - Floodplain management/flood damage prevention.
1007.1. General provisions.
1007.1.1. Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this section is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(5)
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and
(6)
Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.
1007.1.2. Applicability
This section shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Peachtree City.
1007.1.3. Designation of ordinance administrator.
The city engineer or designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this section.
1007.1.4. Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard, areas of future-conditions flood hazard and associated floodplain characteristicsâ€”Flood area maps and studies.
For the purposes of defining and determining "Areas of Special Flood Hazard," "Areas of Future-conditions Flood Hazard," "Areas of Shallow Flooding," "Base Flood Elevations," "Floodplains," "Floodways," "Future-conditions Flood Elevations," "Future-conditions Floodplains," potential flood hazard or risk categories as shown on FIRM maps, and other terms used in this section, the following documents and sources may be used for such purposes and are adopted by reference thereto:
(1)
The flood insurance study (FIS), dated 9/26/2008, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto. [For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for Fayette County, dated 9/26/2008, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto.]
(2)
Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the base or one-percent (100-year) floodplain and flood-prone areas, including:
(a)
Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey or any other local, State or Federal agency applicable to the City of Peachtree City; and
(b)
Any base flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared utilizing FEMA approved methodology and approved by the City of Peachtree City.
(3)
Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the future-conditions flood elevation or delineation of the future-conditions floodplain and flood-prone areas, including:
(a)
Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, State or Federal agency applicable to the City of Peachtree City; and

1007.6. Variance procedures.
The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this section.
(1)
Requests for variances from the requirements of this section shall be submitted to the City of Peachtree City. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the City of Peachtree City. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(2)
Any person adversely affected by any decision of the City of Peachtree City shall have the right to appeal such decision to the city council as established by the city in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city council. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(3)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the appropriate court, as provided in O.C.G.A. Â§ 5-4-1.
(4)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(5)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(6)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(7)
In reviewing such requests, the City of Peachtree City and city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this section.
(8)
Conditions for variances:
(a)
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
(i)
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
(ii)
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
(iii)
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
(b)
The provisions of this section are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(c)
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided.
(d)
The city engineer shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(9)
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the City of Peachtree City and city council shall deem necessary for the consideration of the request.

(Ord. No. 1091, Â§ 1, 3-19-2015)
Editor's noteâ€” Ord. No. 1091, Â§ 1, adopted March 19, 2015, repealed and reenacted section 1007 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, section 1007 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 925, Â§ 1, 1-17-2008; Ord. No. 942, Â§ 1, 5-1-2008.
Sec. 1008. - Groundwater recharge areas.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the City of Peachtree City and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that Peachtree City and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water.
(2)
Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(b)
Establishment of the groundwater recharge area protection district.
(1)
Establishment. The groundwater recharge area protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and made a part of this section.
(2)
Determination of pollution susceptibility. Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and made a part of this section.
(c)
Protection criteria.
(1)
No construction may proceed on any building to be served by a septic tank unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Human Resources, Manual for On-Site Sewage Management (hereinafter DHR Manual) and paragraph (2) below.
(2)
New buildings served by a septic tank/drain field system shall be on lots having minimum size limitations as follows, based on application of Table MT-1 of the DHR Manual (hereinafter DHR Table MT-1). The minimums set forth in DHR Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in Sections A-F) of the DHR Manual.
a.
One hundred fifty percent (150%) of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area;
b.
One hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area;
c.
One hundred ten percent (110%) of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area.
d.
In no event shall the minimum lot size for any building served by a septic tank/drain field system be less than one acre.
(3)
New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; a medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet; or a low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 X 10-7cm/sec or other criteria established by the natural resource and conservation service.
(4)
New above-ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements.
(5)
New facilities that handle hazardous materials of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and which contain amounts of 10,000 gallons or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and local fire code requirements.
(6)
Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility.
(7)
Commercial and industrial operations, either new or existing, which require washing truck railroad cars (tanks or other load types) shall provide containment equal to 110 percent of the container volume as well as a treatment plan and appropriate equipment to handle an emergency.
(d)
Exemptions. Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of this section is exempt from the minimum lot size requirements contained in paragraph (d)(2)a., b., c., and d. above.
(Ord. No. 791, 9-19-02)
Sec. 1009. - Wetland protection.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
The wetlands in the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities.
(2)
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
(3)
The purpose of this section is to promote wetlands protection while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.
(b)
Establishment of the wetlands protection district.
(1)
The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this section, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
(2)
The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this section does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(c)
Protection and requirement criteria. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the city planner using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
(d)
Permitted uses. The following uses shall be allowed within the wetlands protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein.
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(4)
Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
(5)
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed, and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed.
(6)
Education, scientific research, and nature trails.
(e)
Prohibited uses. All uses not classified as permitted uses in paragraph (d) above are considered to be prohibited uses.
(f)
Administration and enforcement. For purposes of administering and enforcing the provisions of the wetland protection section of the land development ordinance, the following requirements shall apply; and they shall be in addition to other requirements pertaining to site plans elsewhere in the land development ordinance:
(1)
Site plans. Application for a development permit for a project involving wetlands shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of at least one-inch equals 50 feet with the following information:
a.
A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut-and-fill involved, cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale, and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings.
b.
A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant.
c.
Location, dimensions, and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 200 feet.
d.
The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected intermittent or perennial stream or water body.
e.
Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent.
f.
All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology.
(2)
Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform to the specifications of said site plan. Significant changes to the site plan can be made only with the approval of the planning commission. The city planner is authorized to make minor changes.
(3)
Duration of permit validity.
a.
If construction described in the development permit has not commenced within 12 months from the date of issuance, the permit shall expire.
b.
If construction described in the development permit is suspended or abandoned after work has commenced, the permit shall expire 12 months after the date that work ceased.
c.
Written notice of pending expiration of the development permit shall be issued by the building official.
(4)
Penalties.
a.
When a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this section, the violator may be required to remove the structure.
b.
When removal of vegetative cover, excavation, or fill has taken place in violation of this section, the violator may be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore the vegetation with similar native vegetation. The restoration plan must be approved by the city planner.
c.
If a violation of this section that also constitutes a violation of any provision of the clean water act, as amended, is discovered, the building official shall issue written notification of the violation to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the landowner.
(5)
Suspension, revocation. The building official may suspend or revoke a permit if he finds that the applicant has not complied with the conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of the work set forth in the permit.
(Ord. No. 791, 9-19-2002)
Sec. 1010. - Illicit discharges.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
The purpose of this ordinance is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Peachtree City through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable. This ordinance establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4). The objectives of this ordinance are:
a.
To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges by any user.
b.
To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
c.
To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this ordinance.
(b)
Applicability. This ordinance shall apply to all water entering the storm drain system generated on any developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by Peachtree City.
(c)
Administration. The community development director shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this ordinance. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the community development director may be delegated in writing by the community development director to persons or entities acting in the beneficial interest of or in the employ of Peachtree City.
(d)
Severability. If the provisions of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this ordinance shall be judged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such order of judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this ordinance.
(e)
Responsibility. The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this ordinance are minimum standards; therefore this ordinance does not intend nor imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants.
(f)
Discharge prohibitions. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows. The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this ordinance:
1)
Water line flushing or other potable water sources, non-commercial landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wet-land flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than one PPM chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants.
2)
Discharges specified in writing by the community development director as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
3)
Dye testing provided that verbal notification is given to the agency prior to the time of the test.
4)
Any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations
(g)
Illicit connections. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. A person is considered to be in violation of this ordinance if the person connects any system conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue.
(h)
Suspension of MS4 Access.
(1)
Emergency situations. Peachtree City may, without prior notice, suspend publicly-owned drainage system access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
(2)
Detection of illicit discharges. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this ordinance may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The community development director will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city council for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the community development director.
(i)
Industrial or construction activity discharges. Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to Peachtree City prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(j)
Discharge monitoring.
(1)
Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges to the publicly owned storm drainage system.
(2)
Access to facilities.
a.
The community development director shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance. If a discharger has security measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of Peachtree City.
b.
Facility operators shall allow the community development director full access to all parts of the premises in order to inspect, sample, examine and copy records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and to perform any additional duties as required by state and federal law.
c.
The community development director shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the developmental services director to monitor and/or sample the facility's stormwater discharge.
d.
The community development director has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary, given that reasonable cause to believe that an illicit discharge or connection exists. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the discharger's own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy per the manufacturer's recommended standards.
e.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly and permanently removed by the operator at the written or oral request of [the] community development director. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
f.
Unreasonable delay in allowing the community development director access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this ordinance. The operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if that person or an agent denies the community development director reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this ordinance.
g.
If the community development director has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, then the community development director may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction upon showing that:

He/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance;
ii.
Or, that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this ordinance or any order issued hereunder;
iii.
Or, to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community.
(k)
Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. Peachtree City may from time to time adopt requirements identifying best management practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or facility, which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. Prior to commencement of substantial improvements to the site, the owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with an industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWP3) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(l)
Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
(m)
Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation who has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of a release of hazardous materials that person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, that person shall notify the community development director in person or by phone, facsimile or email no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the community development director within three business days of the phone notice.

This ordinance seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
a.
Establish decisionmaking processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
b.
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
c.
Establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
d.
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
e.
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan;
f.
Establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and

(6)
Modifications for offsite facilities. The stormwater management plan for each land development project shall provide for stormwater management measures located on the site of the project, unless provisions are made to manage stormwater by an offsite or regional facility. The offsite or regional facility must be located on property legally dedicated for the purpose, must be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater quantity and quality control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by onsite practices and there must be a legally obligated entity responsible for longterm operation and maintenance of the off-site or regional stormwater facility. In addition, on-site measures shall be implemented, where necessary, to protect upstream and downstream properties and drainage channels from the site to the offsite facility. Proper drainage and/or flood easements must also be dedicated between the site and the off-site facility.
A stormwater management plan must be submitted to the city which shows the adequacy of the off-site or regional facility.
To be eligible for a modification, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the use of an off-site or regional facility will not result in the following impacts to upstream or downstream areas:
a.
Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and property;
b.
Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures;
c.
Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation;
d.
Degradation of in-stream biological functions or habitat; or
e.
Water quality impairment in violation of state water quality standards, and/or violation of any state or federal regulations.
(c)
Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this ordinance:
(1)
Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
a.
It is sized to retain the first one inch of rainfall from the site to the maximum extent practicable, as defined in the stormwater design manual. The designer shall refer to the local design manual for additional clarifications on feasibility;
b.
Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the stormwater design manual; and
c.
Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices.
(2)
Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer;
b.
24-hour extended detention storage of the 1-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event;
c.
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.
The city engineer may grant an exemption to stream channel exemption using the criteria outlined in the Stormwater Management Manual.
(3)
Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25- and 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm events.
(4)
Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(5)
Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Stormwater Design Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Stormwater Design Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question.
Applicants shall consult the Stormwater Design Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control.
(6)
Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (c)(1). The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Stormwater Design Manual.
(7)
Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public right-of-ways. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements:
a.
Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual;
b.
All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and
c.
Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual.
(8)
Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.
(d)
Reserved.
(e)
Construction inspections of post-development stormwater management system.
(1)
Inspections to ensure plan compliance during construction. Periodic inspections of the stormwater management system construction shall be conducted by the staff of the city or conducted and certified by a registered professional engineer licensed by the state. Construction inspections shall utilize the approved stormwater management plan for establishing compliance.

a.
The date and location of the inspection;
b.
Whether construction is in compliance with the approved stormwater management plan;
c.
Variations from the approved construction specifications; and
d.
Any other variations or violations of the conditions of the approved stormwater management plan.
If any violations are found, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions.
(2)
Final inspection and as built plans. Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy is issued, or final plat approved, the applicant is responsible for certifying that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan. All applicants are required to submit actual "as built" plans and hydrology studies for any stormwater management facilities, practices, and site improvements after final construction is completed. The plans and hydrology study must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices and must be certified by a professional engineer. The specific requirements for certification, and submitting the "as built" plans and hydrology studies (digital and paper copies) are kept on file in the office of the city engineer.
A final inspection and approval by the city is required before the release of any performance securities can occur.
(f)
Ongoing inspection and maintenance of stormwater facilities and practices.
(1)
Long-term maintenance inspection of stormwater facilities and practices. Stormwater management facilities and practices included in a stormwater management plan which are subject to an inspection and maintenance agreement must undergo ongoing inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of the agreement, the plan and this ordinance.
A stormwater management facility or practice shall be inspected on a periodic basis by the responsible person in accordance with the approved inspection and maintenance agreement. In the event that the stormwater management facility has not been maintained and/or becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the city shall notify the person responsible for carrying out the maintenance plan by registered or certified mail to the person specified in the inspection and maintenance agreement. The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the agreement and the plan and shall specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. If the responsible person fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the city may correct the violation as provided in subsection (f)(4).
Inspection programs by the city may be established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in stormwater management facilities; and evaluating the condition of stormwater management facilities and practices.

1012.5 Land development requirements.
1012.5.1 Buffer and setback requirements.
All land development activity subject to this ordinance shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank.
(2)
An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
(3)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
1012.5.2 Variance procedures.
Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this ordinance, and the city engineer finds and determines that the requirements of this ordinance prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the city council may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
(2)
Except as provided above, the city council shall grant no variance from any provision of this ordinance without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the city council. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
b.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship.
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this ordinance, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
(3)
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
a.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
b.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
c.
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
e.
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
f.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
g.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and,
h.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
(4)
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
a.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
b.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
c.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and,
d.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
e.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance;
f.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.
1012.6 Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements.
This ordinance is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this ordinance should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
1012.7 Additional information requirements for development on buffer zone properties.
Any permit applications for property requiring buffers and setbacks hereunder must include the following:
(1)
A site plan showing:
a.
The location of all streams on the property;

Sec. 1013. - Reserved.
Sec. 1014. - Enforcement.
(a)
Enforcement. The Peachtree City Community Development director (and public services director) shall enforce the provisions of this article as follows:
(1)
The community development director is designated to enforce the grading, vegetation, erosion control, sedimentation, flood control, and drainage provisions of this article for all development and construction projects with the following duties and responsibilities:
a.
Review all development permits to assure that the permit requirements of this ordinance have been satisfied.
b.
Advise permittee when additional federal or state permits may be required, and if specific federal or state permits are known to be required that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file with the development permit.
c.
Notify adjacent communities and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.
(2)
The public services director is designated to enforce those provisions of this section which apply to developed and occupied areas and to property in an undeveloped state affecting city responsibility for maintenance of the storm drainage system. The public services director shall assure that maintenance is provided within any altered or relocated portion of any watercourse so that flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
(b)
Inspection and right of entry. Upon presentation of identification to the developer, contractor, owner, owner's agent, operator or occupants, employees of the city may enter during all reasonable hours any property under proposed or existing development and construction. These employees may make inspections of the facilities for the purpose of determining plan requirements or compliance with ordinance provisions. These designees may inspect any drainage system within or outside of an existing drainage easement. All drainage facilities located on private property, whether dedicated to the city or not, shall be accessible at all times for city inspection. Where drainage facilities are accepted by the city for maintenance, public access easements shall be provided. Reasonable access shall be provided to all drainage easements for inspection and maintenance functions. Where an easement does not exist for the drainage system, the permission of the owner shall be obtained before entrance; however, in the event of emergency maintenance requirements, permission of the owner shall not be mandatory.
(c)
Emergency maintenance. The public services director may conduct emergency maintenance operations on private land and on drainage systems where emergency conditions exist. Emergency maintenance shall constitute the removal of trees and other debris, which in the judgment of the public services director create a condition potentially injurious to life and/or property of the public road system. Emergency maintenance conducted on any drainage system shall not be construed as constituting a continuing maintenance obligation on the part of the city.
(d)
Notice of violation. Whenever the community development director determines that activity on a property does not comply with the approved development and construction plans, he may issue a notice of violation. Whenever he determines that the drainage system has been unlawfully altered, causing inadequate drainage, he may issue a notice of violation. The notice of violation of the provisions of this chapter or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, shall be to the owner of the property or his agent and shall:
(1)
Be in writing;
(2)
Include a description of the property sufficient for identification of where the violation has occurred;
(3)
List the specific provisions of this chapter which have been violated; and
(4)
State that, if these repairs, construction or alterations are not completed within a reasonable time period specified by the inspector, a citation shall be issued for the owner to appear in city court. Each day the violation continues shall constitute a new and separate violation. However, in the judgment of the community development director, where the violation is willful, in wanton disregard of the provisions of this chapter or constitutes a public health and safety hazard, he may obtain a court citation in lieu of a notice of violation.
(e)
Penalties. Any person violating this ordinance shall be punished as provided in section 1-11 of the City of Peachtree City Code for each offense. Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
