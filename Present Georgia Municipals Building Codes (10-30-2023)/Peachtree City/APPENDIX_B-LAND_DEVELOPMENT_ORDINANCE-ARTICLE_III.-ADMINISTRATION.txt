(a)
Construction not subject to impact fees.
The following projects and construction activities do not constitute "development" as defined in this ordinance, and are therefore not subject to the imposition of impact fees:
(1)
Rebuilding no more than the same number of residential units of development or the same square footage for retail, commercial and/or industrial development as defined in this ordinance that were removed by demolition, or destroyed by fire or other catastrophe, on the same lot or property.

(b)
Grandfathered projects.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, that portion of a project for which an impact fee has been paid or is due and owed to the city under the previous ordinance shall not be subject to development impact fees pursuant to this ordinance unless as otherwise required by this ordinance.
Any building for which a valid and complete application for a building permit has been received prior to the effective date of this ordinance may proceed without payment of fees otherwise imposed by this ordinance, provided that:
(1)
All fees and development exactions in effect prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall be or have been paid in full; and
(2)
Said construction shall be commenced, pursued and completed within the time established by the building permit, or within 180 days, whichever is later. If said construction is not completed within this timeframe, the city shall impose additional impact fees that are in effect at the time construction is complete.
(c)
Method of calculation.
Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this ordinance shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ordinance, the calculation of impact fees shall be net of credits for the present value of ad valorem taxes or other revenues as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and which:
(1)
Are reasonably expected to be generated by new growth and development; and
(2)
Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which an impact fee is imposed.
The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this ordinance shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of Peachtree City, Georgia, and may be amended from time to time by official act.
In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
307.7 Fee assessment and payment.
(a)
Impact fee schedule.
Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to the impact fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment "A" for a property located inside of Peachtree City, shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by Peachtree City, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this ordinance.
When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure.
In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the impact fee schedule or fits within a different category, then:
The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee.
In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted impact fee schedule.
If a land use designation is not in a category contained in this ordinance, then an appropriate new category may be added by the administrator and an appropriate fee established under the city's current impact fee methodology, subject to annual confirmation by the city council.
Appeals from the decision of the administrator shall be made to the city council in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this ordinance.
(b)
Timing of assessment and payment.
Development impact fees shall be assessed at the time of application for a building permit. All development impact fees shall be due and collected prior to issuance of a building permit.
For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property.
If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit or approval of a certificate of occupancy. An adjustment may result in a refund to the fee payor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit.
(c)
Individual assessment determinations.
Individual assessments of development impact fees may be established as follows:
At their option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project in lieu of the fee established on the impact fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment "A".
In the event that an applicant elects an individual assessment, the applicant shall submit an individual assessment study. Each individual assessment study shall:
(1)
Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering or planning data; or
(2)
Be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in Peachtree City or its region, carried out by qualified engineers or planners pursuant to accepted methodology; and
(3)
Provide any other written specifications as may be reasonably required by the administrator to substantiate the individual assessment determination.
(4)
The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall determine whether the content of an individual assessment study satisfies the requirements of this ordinance. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the city council in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this ordinance.
(5)
Any fee approved as an individual assessment determination shall have standing for 180 days following the date of approval. Payment of such an approved individual assessment determination shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by Peachtree City, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this ordinance.
(d)
Fee certification.
Upon application to the administrator, a developer may receive a certification of the development impact fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment "A" or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable. Such certified schedule or fee shall establish the development impact fee due for a period of 180 days from the date of certification, even if new or revised rate schedules are adopted in the interim.
307.8. Exemptions.
(a)
Exemption policy.
The city council of Peachtree City finds that certain office or industrial uses that create unusually high investment, economic or job creation benefits represent extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the City of Peachtree City in proportion to the creation of such benefits. To encourage such development projects, the city council may consider granting a reduction in the impact fee based on a determination and relative to the extent that the business or project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to Peachtree City, as adopted in the exemption criteria. It is also recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees.
(b)
Evaluation criteria.
The following factors, among others, shall be considered in determining the extent to which a development project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the City of Peachtree City:
1.
Use: Preference will be given to the construction or expansion of national or regional corporate office facilities and to construction or expansion of projects related to industries primarily involved in research and development, assembly, manufacturing or distribution. Particular consideration will be given to development and/or redevelopment of structures in those areas identified as character areas in the city's comprehensive plan.
2.
Investment: The total amount of new private capital investment in land, buildings and equipment related to the project and to the total capital investment in current facilities if the project expands an existing business within the city.
3.
Annual economic impact: The total annual amount of new wages, purchases, employee travel and training and related expenses, and other expenditures that will be generated as a result of the project and to the total annual economic impact of current facilities if the project expands an existing business within the city.
4.
Job creation:
a.
The total number of jobs created and/or retained as a result of the project.
b.
The number of jobs created and/or retained paying at least 100 percent of the average wage for Fayette County as established by the Georgia Department of Labor.
c.
The number of jobs created or retained that are exempt managerial and/or professional and/or senior executive jobs.
(c)
Impact fee exemption guidelines.
Any applicant for an exemption shall present a written request for such an exemption to the administrator. The request shall include such data of relevance to the evaluation criteria and may include any relevant documents in support of the request.
The administrator shall forward the application to any and all boards, commissions, or authorities of the City or Fayette County, as applicable, who shall review the request and provide their recommendation to the administrator. At a minimum, the administrator shall forward the application to the Development Authority of Peachtree City (DAPC) for review and consideration and recommendation. Each recommendation shall be included in the information provided by the administrator to city council.
The administrator shall prepare a report for the city council with a recommendation on whether or not the exemption should be granted and, if so, what amount should be exempted. The amount of the exemption shall be related to the public benefit, as determined under the evaluation criteria, and such other factors as the administrator may consider relevant. Acting upon the recommendation of the Administrator, but not bound by such recommendation, an impact fee exemption shall then be determined by the city council for a development or expansion project that is determined to represent extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the City of Peachtree City.
The amount of the exemption shall be limited as follows:
1.
Business-related development and expansion projects may be considered for an impact fee exemption of up to 50 percent of the fee otherwise due, reflecting the extent to which the project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth under the evaluation criteria.
2.
An additional impact fee exemption of up to 25 percent may be considered for such a project that is or is proposed to be located entirely within the Peachtree City Industrial Park.
3.
An additional impact fee exemption of up to 25 percent may be considered if such a project represents an expansion of an existing building already located within the Peachtree City Industrial Park.
(d)
Reimbursement of impact fee fund.
It is recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees. As a part of the project budgeting process, adequate funds shall be identified and transferred to the impact fee fund accounts equal to the amount of all exemptions granted. Any such funds shall be transferred over a period of time equal to the time period over which the project is financed.
(e)
The city council may grant or deny an exemption taking into account the criteria set forth herein, the economic condition of the city, and the city's impact fee fund and program. The decision by the city council to grant or deny an exemption shall be discretionary, and each application for an exemption shall be reviewed on its own merits, taking the factors set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) into consideration. City council is under no obligation to take action and exempt any application regardless of its similarity to a previously approved application.
307.9. Deposit and expenditure of fees.
(a)
Maintenance of funds.
All development impact fee funds collected for future expenditure on construction or expansion of facilities pursuant to this ordinance shall be maintained in one or more interest-bearing accounts until encumbered or expended. Restrictions on the investment of development impact fee funds shall be the same that apply to investment of all such funds generally.
Separate accounting records shall be maintained for each category of system improvements within each service area wherein fees are collected.

(1)
Impact fees collected to recover the present value of excess capacity in existing system improvements;
(2)
Any portion of an impact fee collected as a repayment for expenditures made by Peachtree City for system improvements intended to be funded by such impact fee; and
(3)
Any portion of the impact fee (but not to exceed three percent of the total) collected and allocated by the administrator for administration of the impact fee ordinance, and such additional amount assessed for repayment of the cost of preparing the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
(c)
Annual report.
The administrator shall prepare an annual report to the city council as part of the annual audit describing the amount of any development impact fees collected, encumbered, and used during the preceding fiscal year by category of public facility and service area.
Such annual report shall be prepared following guidelines of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA), and submitted to DCA in conjunction with the annual update of the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
307.10. Credits.
When eligible, fee payors shall be entitled to a credit against impact fees otherwise due and owing under the circumstances and in the manner set forth in this section.
(a)
Credits; restrictions.
Except as provided in paragraph 2 below, no credit shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of this ordinance.
If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) prior to the effective date of this ordinance for system improvements that are included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive land use plan, is greater than the impact fee that would otherwise have been paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ordinance, any credit due under this section shall not constitute a liability of Peachtree City, and shall accrue to the developer to the extent of impact fees assessed for new development for the same category of system improvements within the same service area.
In no event shall credit be given for project improvements, or for system improvements not included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
(b)
Granting of credits.
Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that:
(1)
The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive land use plan;
(2)
The amount of the credit does not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding, as shown in the capital improvements element; and
(3)
The city council shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction, dedication, or transfer.
(4)
The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the impact fee due for such system improvement unless a greater credit is authorized under a private agreement executed under the provisions of section 9 of this ordinance.
(c)
Guidelines for credit valuation.
Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines:
(1)
For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated.
(2)
For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated.
(3)
For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that Peachtree City, Georgia would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less.
(4)
For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest accepted by the city, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated.
(5)
In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a State of Georgia, AA rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the city council in its sole discretion may deem appropriate.
(d)
Credits; application.
Credits shall be given only upon written request of the developer to the administrator. A developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the administrator at or before the time of development impact fee assessment.
The administrator, in his or her sole discretion, shall review all claims for credits and make determinations regarding the allowance of any claimed credit, and the value of any allowed credit.
Any credit approved by the administrator shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator and calculated at the time of impact fee assessment.
(e)
Credits; abandoned building permits.
In the event that an impact fee is paid but the building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the impact fee against future impact fees for the same parcel of land, upon submission of adequate evidence to the administrator that an impact fee was received by the city, the amount paid, and that the building permit was abandoned.
307.11. Refunds.
(a)
Eligibility for a refund.
Upon the request of a fee payor regarding a property on which a development impact fee has been paid, the development impact fee shall be refunded if:
