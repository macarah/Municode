The grantee shall be entitled to charge for gas furnished by it such rates as are prescribed by the public service commission or other lawful regulatory body of the state.
(Ord. No. 696, § 2, 8-20-1998)
Sec. 82-38. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Base year means the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998.
Base year franchise fee factor means the total franchise fees paid during the base year divided by the design day capacity as recorded by the grantee on the last day of the base year.
Design day capacity means the sum of the individual capacity in dekatherms (Dt) attributable to all firm customers located within the city limits as of the last day of the previous fiscal year.
Firm customers means all residential and business customers who purchase gas service that ordinarily is not subject to interruption or curtailment.
Fiscal year means the 12 months ending September 30 of each year.
Inflation index means the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or any successor index, for the period from September 30, 1997, to the beginning of the then current fiscal year. The percentage shall be reduced by any productivity factor adjustment for the same time period determined by the state public service commission for the grantee.
(Ord. No. 696, § 3.1, 8-20-1998)
Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 82-39. - Franchise fee.
The total dollar amount of franchise fees paid by the grantee to the city shall be calculated as follows:
(1)
The current fiscal year total franchise fee shall equal the product of the design day capacity and the current franchise fee factor. The current franchise fee factor shall be equal to the product of the base year franchise fee factor and one plus the inflation index expressed as a decimal to three significant digits.
(2)
The following formula quantifies this payment:
FFc = FFFby × (1 + (CPI-PFA)) × DDCc
EXPAND
FFc = total Franchise Fees due the city for the current fiscal year, and
*FFFby = the base year Franchise Fee Factor
CPI-PFA = the Inflation Index based on the cumulative change in the Consumer Price Index less the Productivity Factor Adjustment determined by the public service commission
DDCc = the Design Day Capacity as of the last day of the previous fiscal year
*FFFby = FFby/DDCby
FFFby = the total Franchise Fees paid in the base year
DDCby = the Design Day Capacity of the base year

Sec. 82-104. - Stormwater user fee charges.
(a)
It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service areas shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services. Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city, including, but not limited to, plan review and inspection fees, fees for special services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, system development charges and special assessments.
(b)
To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities.
(Ord. No. 871, § 1, 2-2-2006)
Sec. 82-105. - Stormwater user fee charge rates.
(a)
Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the city council. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, and together with other sources of support available to the city stormwater utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city.
(1)
Detached single family residential (DSFR) customer class. Detached single family residential properties have been segregated into three separate tiers for billing based on a representative statistical analysis of impervious surface area located on the various DSFR properties.
a.
Tier 1 DSFR: The charges shall be equal to 0.68 ERU = 3,128 square feet, billed as a flat rate.
b.
Tier 2 DSFR: The charges shall be equal to 1.0 ERU = 4,600 square feet, billed as a flat rate.
c.
Tier 3 DSFR: The charges shall be equal to 1.52 ERU = 6,992 square feet, billed as a flat rate.
(2)
Attached residential (AR) customer class. Attached single family residential properties have been segregated into two separate tiers for billing based on a representative statistical analysis of impervious surface area located on the various AR properties and/or whether or not the development has public or private roads/streets.
a.
AR with public roads: The charges shall be equal to 0.47 ERU = 2,162 square feet, billed as a flat rate.
b.
AR with private roads: The charges shall be equal to the total impervious surface area of the development divided by the ERU (4,600 square feet) and apportioned equally among the dwelling units within the development.
(3)
Non-single family residential (NSFR) customer class. NSFR properties shall be billed one ERU for each 4,600 square feet, or portion thereof, of impervious surfaces located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs for NSFR properties will be rounded to two decimal places to establish the actual number of ERUs for billing. If a NSFR property has less than 1.00 ERU, then the customer will be billed a minimum of 1.00 ERU.
(b)
Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be applied to customers as follows:
(1)
The DSFR stormwater user fee flat rate charge shall be as follows:
a.
Tier 1 DSFR customers: $4.69 per month.
b.
Tier 2 DSFR customers: $6.89 per month.
c.
Tier 3 DSFR customers: $10.47 per month.
d.
All DSFR customers shall be billed periodically for stormwater services on a schedule established by the city council.
e.
For those DSFR customers which live within subdivisions that are serviced by private roads, a prorated share of the total impervious surface area associated with the private road shall be added as a surcharge to the bill for those properties of the subdivision that are serviced by the private road. This will be accomplished by dividing the total impervious area of the private roads in the subdivision by the ERU (4,600 square feet) and then equally dividing the ERUs among the dwelling units in the subdivision. The charge for the surcharge shall be added to the monthly bill amount by multiplying the prorated share of the ERUs by a rate of $6.89 per ERU.
(2)

a.
AR with public roads: $3.22 flat rate per month per unit. These customers shall be billed periodically for stormwater services on a schedule established by the city council.
b.
AR with private roads: The charges shall be equal to the total impervious surface area of the development divided by the ERU (4,600 square feet) times a rate of $6.89 per ERU per month and apportioned equally among the dwelling units. These customers shall be billed periodically for stormwater services on a schedule established by the city council.
(3)
The NSFR stormwater user charge for each ERU, or fractional ERU, shall be as follows:
a.
$6.89 per ERU (4,600 square feet) per month.

(4)
A surcharge shall be added to all bills for impervious surfaces associated with streets, cart paths, public buildings and other public facilities for which the city maintains ownership or maintenance responsibility.

Sec. 82-108. - Enforcement methods and inspections.
(a)
All property owners of improved property within the incorporated areas of the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable city development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the city municipal court.

(b)
Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater manager, the city may elect to sue in the city municipal court to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the city municipal court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of filing of such abatement action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the city municipal court.
(c)
The city shall have the right for its designated officers and employees to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours, and after reasonable notice to the owner thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law.

Determining that stormwater management systems and facilities need to be constructed.
(Ord. No. 871, § 1, 2-2-2006)
Sec. 82-109. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments.
Failure to receive a stormwater utility bill is not justification for non-payment. The property owner, as identified from public land records of Fayette County, shall be obligated to pay the appropriate stormwater user fee charge for that property.
(1)
Billing.
a.
Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue April 1, 2006, and shall be billed prospectively. The initial billing cycle will be April 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007. A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater user fee charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due.
b.
The stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected as deemed most effective and efficient by the city council.
c.
Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by the city council.
d.
Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each developed property subject to stormwater user fee charges shall be obligated to pay stormwater user fee charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater user fee charge payments.
e.
If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of improved property, the city stormwater utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period.
(2)
Delinquencies and collection.
a.
Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by state law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fieri facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the owner and/or the property.
b.
A late charge shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility user fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner.
(3)
Adjustments. The stormwater manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge.
a.
If a customer believes their stormwater user fee is incorrect, the customer may seek and adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property within 60 days of the mailing of such bill to the customer by the city. After such 60-day period, the stormwater bill shall be final and no adjustment may be sought by the customer until the issuance of the next stormwater bill by the city. Any such request shall be submitted in writing to the stormwater manager and shall set forth in detail the grounds upon which the adjustment is sought.
b.
Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide supplemental information to the stormwater manager, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustment request.
c.
Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater manager, the stormwater manager shall have 30 calendar days within which to render a written decision. Concurrent payment of any charges allocated to the property is not required as a condition precedent to this request for review.
d.
In considering an adjustment request, the stormwater manager shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater utility user fee charge for the property is correct.
e.
The stormwater manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing.
f.
If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater bill for an amount not to exceed the equivalent of one-year's charges at current rates for that property regardless of whether credits apply to the property. If the result of the adjustment is that the bill will be increased, then the city shall apply the new billing rate on the next billing cycle.
g.
No adjustments shall be made to any bill upon the expiration of 60 days after the date that such bill is mailed by the city to the customer, it being the intention of this section to establish such limitation period of 60 days upon the customers to seek an adjustment of their stormwater charge.
(Ord. No. 871, § 1, 2-2-2006; Ord. No. 1057, § 1, 2-7-2013)
Sec. 82-110. - Appeals, hearings.
(a)
Appeals. An appeal to the city manager may be taken by any property owner or customer aggrieved by any decision of the stormwater manager. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days of the decision of the stormwater manager by filing with the city manager a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of the notice of appeal, the stormwater manager shall forthwith transmit to the city manager all documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken.
(b)
Hearing. The city manager shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give written notice to the appellant at least ten days prior to the hearing date. The notice shall indicate the place, date and time of the hearing. The city manager shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the stormwater manager after hearing the evidence. If the decision of the stormwater manager is reversed in whole or in part, resulting in a refund or credit due to the property owner, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal.
(c)
The decision of the city manager shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the city manager may appeal that decision to the superior court of Fayette county by writ of certiorari.
