(2)
The discharge of firearms is permitted in areas designated by the city council as firing ranges. Such firing range must be designated by means of permit issued by the city council. A permit will be issued only after the applicant has provided satisfactory evidence, in writing, that all safety aspects pertaining to the range and its operation have been assured. Continued compliance with these safety aspects is a necessary condition for the permit and hence, the designation to remain valid.
(b)
Firing ranges must be designed, located, constructed, operated, maintained and controlled in a manner so as to protect the citizens of the city from the accidental or irresponsible act of discharging a firearm.
(c)
Inspection of the firing range facilities by the city police department may be conducted at random times to evaluate the compliance with all conditions of the permit.

State Law reference— Theft of services, O.C.G.A. § 16-8-5.
Sec. 50-21. - Social hosting.
(a)
Purpose. The city council desires to protect the health, safety and welfare of all persons living in and visiting the city. The use of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 is prohibited by Georgia law and under the Peachtree City Code of Ordinances. This section prohibits and establishes penalties for any person hosting an event or gathering where alcohol is present and being possessed or consumed by persons under 21 years of age.
(b)
Findings. The city council intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The city council finds that:
(1)
Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement.
(2)
Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions. Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user.
(3)
Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present, and condone the activity, and in some circumstances provide the alcohol.
(4)
An ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption. A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs.
(c)
Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
Alcohol means ethyl alcohol, hydrated oxide of ethyl, or spirits of wine, whiskey, rum, brandy, gin, or any other distilled spirits including dilutions and mixtures thereof from whatever source or by whatever process produced.

Cancellation means the process where response is terminated when the alarm company (designated by the alarm user) notifies the emergency communications center that there is not an existing situation at the alarm site requiring police response after an alarm dispatch request. If cancellation occurs prior to the police arriving at the scene, this is not a false alarm for the purpose of civil penalty, and no penalty will be assessed.
Communications center means Fayette County E911 Communications.
False alarm means the activation of an alarm system to summon law enforcement personnel which occurs as a result of mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his/her employees or agents, unless the request for response was cancelled by the alarm user or his/her agent before the police arrive at the alarm location. An alarm is false within the meaning of this article when, upon inspection by the police department, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises, which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm shall not include an alarm, which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by violent conditions of nature, nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered a false alarm if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the user's alarm company, or designee, to test the system.
Holdup alarm means a silent alarm signal generated by the manual activation of a device intended to signal a robbery in progress.

Permit year means a 12-month period beginning on the day and month on which an alarm permit is issued to October 1st of the same year. The 12-month period is then effective October 1st to September 30th every year.
Runaway alarm means an alarm system that produces repeated alarm signals that do not appear to be caused by separate human action. The police department may in its discretion discontinue police responses to alarm signals from what appears to be a runaway alarm.
SIA Control Panel Standard CP-01 means the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) approved Security Industry Association (SIA) CP-01 Control Panel Standard, as may be updated from time to time, that details recommended design features for security system control panels and their associated arming and disarming devices to reduce false alarms. Control panels built and tested to this standard by nationally recognized testing organizations, will be marked to state: "Design evaluated in accordance with SIA CP-01 Control Panel Standard Features for False Alarm Reduction."
Verify means an attempt by the monitoring company, or its representative, to contact the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone and/or other electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting the police for dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request. For the purpose of this article, telephone verification shall require, at a minimum that a second call be made to a different number if the first attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly identify themselves to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch.

Attempt to verify, by calling the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone, to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting dispatch.
