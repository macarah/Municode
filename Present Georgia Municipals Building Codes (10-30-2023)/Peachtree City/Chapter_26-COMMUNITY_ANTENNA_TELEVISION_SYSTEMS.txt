The granting, giving or waiving of any one or more of such consents shall not render unnecessary any subsequent consent or consents. Further, the council can require that its consent to such a transfer or assignment be contingent on conducting negotiations with potential assignees or transferees concerning modification of this franchise agreement if the council reasonably believes that such modification is in the best interests of the city.

Transfer of control of the cable television system which is a pro forma transfer to a parent or a wholly owned subsidiary corporation, or to a partnership with the same general partner as grantee, or hypothecation as the result of a commercial loan, does not require prior notice to and approval by the city. For the purpose of this section, the term "control" is not limited to majority stock ownership, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised.

Parties shall be so excused only for the length of time and to the extent such force majeure prevents either party from abiding by or complying with the terms of the franchise.
