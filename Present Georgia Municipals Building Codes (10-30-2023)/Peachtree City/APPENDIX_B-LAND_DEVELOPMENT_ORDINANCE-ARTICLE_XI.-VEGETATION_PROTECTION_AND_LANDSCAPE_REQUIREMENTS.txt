Editor's noteâ€” Ord. No. 841, adopted December 2, 2004, amended article XI in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, article XI pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 435, adopted June 4, 1987; Ord. No. 500, adopted July 6, 1989; Ord. No. 716, adopted July 1, 1999.

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL

Sec. 1101. - Purpose.
Intent of article and declaration of public policy. The guiding presumption behind this article is the belief that the natural environment has significant value in and of itself, and that all reasonable measures available should be used in the preservation of that environment, consistent with the continued development of a viable Peachtree City.
The city council, therefore, declares it to be public policy to:
(a)
Aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance by contributing to the process of air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge, and stormwater runoff retardation, while at the same time aiding in noise, glare, and heat abatement.
(b)
Assist in providing adequate light and air by preventing overcrowding of land.
(c)
Provide visual buffering and enhance beautification of the city.
(d)
Safeguard and attempt to enhance property values and, in so doing, protect private and public investment.
(e)
Preserve, protect and further the unique identity and environment of the city, and, thereby, preserve the economic base attracted to the city by such factors.
(f)
Recognize that the protection and enhancement of the natural beauty, environment, and greenspace within the city contributes to the economy, as well as provides a truly necessary aesthetic balance to the development of an urban setting.
(g)
Conserve an ever-dwindling supply of energy, by the preservation and enhancement of the natural environment.
(h)
Protect the atmosphere, lands, and water from pollution, impairment or unnecessary destruction.
(i)
Protect natural vegetation except where its removal is necessary for responsible property development or control of disease and infestation. This article shall serve to dissuade the unnecessary clearing of land and its disturbance, so as to preserve, insofar as possible, the natural and existing growth of vegetation, and to replace whenever possible the removed foliage with new vegetation.
(j)
Protect vegetation within the intermediate regional floodplain and for a minimum ten feet from the banks of those streams not having defined intermediate regional floodplain elevation contours, so as to assist in the retention of stormwater runoff and the control of erosion, including particularly the protection of stream bank stability by vegetation or restoration.
(k)
Preserve protected and specimen trees or stands of trees which are exceptional representatives of their species either in terms of size, age or unusual botanical quality, and encourage the good care of same through properly applied forestry practices.
(l)
Protect and supplement existing vegetation within greenbelts, open space, recreation areas, protected areas, and scenic roads where feasible.
(m)
Encourage and promote the use of native and drought tolerant plant material on all development sites.

(c)
The plan shall provide no less than three caliper inches of canopy trees and no less than two caliper inches of understory trees for every 1,000 square feet of impervious surface on the overall site.
Example:
A development site contains 68,000 SF of impervious surface.
Divide 68,000 by 1,000, which equals 68.
Multiply 68 x 3 to determine the total caliper inches of canopy trees required. In this case, a total of 204 caliper inches of canopy trees must be provided.
Multiply 68 x 2 to determine the total caliper inches of understory trees required. In this case, a total of 136 caliper inches of understory trees must be provided.
(1)
Each canopy tree shall be a minimum of two and one-half inches in caliper.
(2)
Each deciduous understory tree shall be a minimum of two inches in caliper.
(3)
Each multi-trunk tree used as understory trees shall have a minimum of three canes, each of which shall be a minimum of two inches in caliper.
(4)
Each evergreen understory tree shall be a minimum of 15 gallons in size or a minimum of six feet in height above finish grade at the time of planting.
(5)
Sizing and grading standards for all plant material shall comply with the latest edition of the American Standard for Nursery Stock as prepared by the American Association of Nurserymen and adopted by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI Z60.1).
(d)
All areas not devoted to structures, parking, driveways, site development features or the preservation of natural vegetation shall be landscaped.
(e)
Preservation of existing vegetation on a project site is highly encouraged.
(1)
For those developments that designate and maintain tree save areas other than vegetation located within tree save and/or landscape buffers or areas identified for future development, the planning commission may permit up to a 25 percent reduction in the total number of trees required by this ordinance. Tree save areas must be identified on the final site plan and protected with a tree-save barrier during construction. No construction materials, construction debris, or equipment shall be permitted to be stored within the tree-save areas.
Tree credit shall be determined as follows:
Total SF of project site designated as undisturbed tree save area
Total SF of property x 100 = Potential tree credit (%)
Example:
The total property area is 1.4 acres (60,984 SF).
The Applicant is proposing to designate 6,500 SF as a permanent tree save area. The potential tree credit is calculated as follows:
(6,500/60,984) x 100 = 11% of potential tree save credit
(2)
Special consideration may be given when specimen trees are preserved and protected on a project site. These trees shall be identified on the tree survey submitted as a part of the conceptual site plan review process and shall be inspected by the city landscape architect and/or a certified arborist to determine the health of the tree.
In those instances where specimen trees are protected, the planning commission may consider a reduction in the total caliper inches of trees required by this ordinance.
(f)
It is recommended, but not required, that all planting and lawn areas include an underground irrigation system with a programmable timer and operational rain shut-off device.
(1)
If an underground irrigation system is not provided, a water source shall be provided no less than 100 feet from all planting areas.
(2)
The property owner shall be responsible for insuring the plant material is properly watered.
(g)
The city planner may require additional vegetation to assist in re-naturalizing areas which visually impact public rights-of-way. The intent of this requirement is to supplement tree replacement requirements with smaller plant material (one-gallon maximum) in buffer areas that are void of vegetation.
(Ord. No. 1072, Â§ 1, 2-6-2014; Ord. No. 1135, Â§ 1, 10-5-2017)
