In the fiscal control system of the city, the following terms shall have the respective meanings and application ascribed to them:

Appropriation means an authorization granted by the mayor and council to make expenditures or to incur obligations for specific purposes.
Appropriation balance means unencumbered balance of appropriation or allotment, and unexpended balance of appropriation or allotment.

Asset means real and personal property of all kinds of a government, including both current assets and fixed assets.
Audit means the examination of records, documents, reports, systems of internal control, accounting and financial procedures, and other evidence for one or more of the following purposes:
(1)
To ascertain whether the statements prepared from the accounts present fairly the financial position and the results of financial operations of the constituent funds and balance account groups of the governmental unit in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to governmental units and on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year;
(2)
To determine the propriety, legality and mathematical accuracy of a governmental unit's financial transactions;
(3)
To ascertain whether all financial transactions have been properly recorded; and
(4)
To ascertain the stewardship of public officials who handle and are responsible for the financial resources of a governmental unit.
Balance sheet means a statement ordinarily prepared from books kept by double entry showing assets, liabilities, reserves and surplus of a fund of a governmental unit at a specified date properly classified to exhibit financial position of the fund or unit at that date.
Budget means a plan of financial operation embodying an estimate of proposed expenditures during a budget period and the proposed means of financing them.
Budget period means the period for which a budget is proposed or a budget ordinance or resolution is adopted. The annual budget refers to a period of one year called a fiscal year.
Budgetary control means the control of management of a governmental unit in accordance with an approved budget and keeping expenditures within the limitations of available appropriations or revenues.

Credit rating is a measurement of the city's ability and intention to fulfill financial obligations.
Current surplus means the excess of the current assets of a fund over its current liabilities and reserves.
Debit and credit are terms commonly used to indicate the manner in which a transaction is to be recorded. Every entry on the left side of the ledger sheet is called a "debit." Every entry on the right side of the ledger sheet is called a "credit."
Debt service means the amount of money necessary annually to pay the principal and interest on the city's outstanding long-term debt.
Delinquent taxes means taxes remaining unpaid on and after the date on which a penalty for nonpayment is attached.

Encumbrances means commitments of appropriations related to unperformed (executory) contracts for goods or services.
Fund means a fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts recording cash and other financial resources, together with all related liabilities and residual equities or balances and changes therein, which are segregated for the purpose of carrying on specific activities or attaining certain objectives in accordance with special regulations, restrictions, or limitations.
Internal audit means an audit made by persons on the staff of the governmental unit whose accounts are being audited primarily for the purpose of internal control. Note: An internal audit is usually a continuous audit.
Liabilities means debts owed.
Modified accrual basis means the basis of accounting according to which:

Millage means the property tax rate, derived from the term "mill," which is one one-thousandth of a United States dollar. Millage is determined by dividing the total amount of ad valorem tax revenue to be raised by one-thousandth of the total assessed value of taxable property within the city.
