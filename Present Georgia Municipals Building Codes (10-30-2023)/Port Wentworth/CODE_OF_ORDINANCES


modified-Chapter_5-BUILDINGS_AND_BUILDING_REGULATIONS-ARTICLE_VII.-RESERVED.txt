Editor's note— Ord. No. 96-09, adopted June 27, 1996, being not specifically amendatory of the Code, has been treated as superseding provisions formerly codified as Ch. 5, Art. VII, §§ 5-131—5-139. In order to provide for better classification, the editor has included there new provisions as Ch. 7, Art. IV. These former provisions were derived from Ord. No. 89-22, adopted Oct. 26, 1989.

Secs. 5-131—5-150. - Reserved.
