ARTICLE II. - PURPOSE

2.1 - Purpose.
The purpose of this Ordinance is to establish minimum standards for the use of land and improvements in Troup County, Georgia. The zoning regulations and districts herein established are designed to:
• Lessen congestion in the roads and streets;
• Provide safety from fire, panic, and other dangers to the public well-being;
• Promote health and general welfare;
• Provide adequate water, light and air;
• Avoid undue concentration of the population while still encouraging smart growth practices;
• Provide for safe and efficient transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public services and requirements for adequate levels of service;
• Conserve and promote economic prosperity;
• Encourage the most appropriate use of land and structures;
• Promote quality of life for all citizens; and
• Provide consistency with the approved and adopted Comprehensive Plan for Troup County.
2.2 - Policy Guide.
The requirements of these regulations are minimum permissible standards; and it is expected that developers and the decision making authorities for developments will normally strive for quality developments that will exceed these minimum requirements.
The comprehensive plan adopted by resolution of the Troup County Board of Commissioners is established as a policy guide for the county. The unincorporated areas of the county are divided into land use categories consistent with the character area map and future development map of the comprehensive plan. The comprehensive plan does not alter or affect the existing zoning districts in the county, does not amend the official zoning maps, and does not by itself permit or prohibit any existing land uses. The Troup County Planning Commission shall examine the character area map and future development map and approved zoning changes on an annual basis to assure consistency between the two maps and may recommend changes as needed to maintain consistency.
2.3 - Comprehensive Plan Review.
The comprehensive plan shall be reviewed on an annual basis and updated if conditions have changed to such a degree that the existing comprehensive plan and zoning are no longer consistent with each other. The update shall be used to identify current uses of land, emerging growth patterns and any significant change in land use policy. The update shall also be used as policy guide in the county's consideration of proposed amendments to the zoning map or text of the zoning ordinance. All amendments to the Troup County Comprehensive Plan shall be in accordance with the minimum planning standards and procedures of the Georgia Planning Act.
