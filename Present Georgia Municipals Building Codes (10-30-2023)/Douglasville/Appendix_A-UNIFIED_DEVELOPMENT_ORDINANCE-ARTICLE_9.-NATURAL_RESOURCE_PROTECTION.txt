ARTICLE 9. - NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION

Sec. 9.01. - Stream buffer protection.
A.
Findings. Whereas, the City of Douglasville finds that buffers adjacent to streams provide numerous benefits including:
1.
Protecting, restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and biological integrity of streams and their water resources;
2.
Removing pollutants delivered in urban stormwater;
3.
Reducing erosion and controlling sedimentation;
4.
Protecting and stabilizing stream banks;
5.
Providing for infiltration of stormwater runoff;
6.
Maintaining base flow of streams;
7.
Contributing organic matter that is a source of food and energy for the aquatic ecosystem;
8.
Providing tree canopy to shade streams and promote desirable aquatic habitat;
9.
Providing riparian wildlife habitat;
10.
Furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity; and
11.
Providing opportunities for the protection and restoration of greenspace.
B.
Purposes. The purpose of this section is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare; to minimize public and private losses due to erosion, siltation and water pollution; and to maintain stream water quality by provisions designed to:
1.
Create buffer zones along the streams of the city for the protection of water resources; and
2.
Minimize land development within such buffers by establishing buffer zone requirements and by requiring authorization for any such activities.
C.
Applicability; compatibility with other buffer regulations. This section shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area as defined in this UDO. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law or as may be prescribed under this UDO, and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations. This section is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this section should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this UDO imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
D.
Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from section 9.01, stream buffer protection. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property.
1.
Activities for building one of the following:
a.
A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line;
b.
Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures;
c.
Intrusions necessary to provide access to a property;
d.
Public access facilities that must be on the water including boat ramps, docks, foot trails leading directly to the river, fishing platforms and overlooks;
e.
Unpaved foot trails and paths;
f.
Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality and/or aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used.
2.
Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least 25 feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in subsection D.1.
3.
Land development activities within a right-of-way existing on April 1, 2008 or approved under the terms of this division or by variance.
4.
Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this UDO takes effect or approved under the terms of this UDO, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures.
5.
Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the zoning official on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the zoning official to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area.
6.
Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer.
E.
Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this UDO shall meet the following requirements:
1.
An undisturbed natural vegetative stream buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank.
2.
An additional stream setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed 50 foot natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited along the banks of all perennial and intermittent State waters. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
3.
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the stream buffer or the stream setback.

B.
Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
1.
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections B.2. or B.3. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit.
2.
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
a.
Best management practices as set forth in sections b. and c. of this section shall be required or all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the development official or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph b. of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
b.
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
c.
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the city or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
d.
The development official may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. For the purposes of this article 9, natural resource protection, the city engineer and their designees shall function as the development official.
3.
Additional requirements. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
a.
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner to minimize erosion;
b.
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
c.
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
d.
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
e.
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
f.
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
g.
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
h.
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
i.
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped using debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
j.
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
k.
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
l.
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner to adversely affect other property owners;
m.
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
n.
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection B.2.b;
o.
Except as provided in paragraph 9.02 B.3.p. of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the development official determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the development official pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. at. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 5, pt. 6, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the development official as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
1)
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
2)
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (1) Stream crossings for water lines; or (2) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
p.
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The city may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
1)
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
2)
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (a) Stream crossings for water lines; or (b) Stream crossings for sewer lines.
4.
Exceeding minimum requirements. Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any city from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection B.2, minimum requirements/BMPs and B.3, additional requirements.
5.
Presumption of violation. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
C.
Application/permit process.
1.
Generally. The property owner or operator, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The city shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning code, the development code, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. However, the owner or the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit; every application shall be accompanied by written proof that the applicant is the owner or operator of the subject property.
2.
Application requirements.
a.
Permit required. No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Douglasville, Georgia, without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD, as applicable.
b.
Application. The application for a permit shall be submitted to the development official and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 9.02.B. of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsection 9.02.B. of this section will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by seven copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. Additional copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans may also be submitted directly to EPD, as specified by the development official.
c.
Fees. The city assesses local permitting fees and state-mandated fees. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. A fee, as identified in the fee schedule for the City of Douglasville, shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. In addition to the local permitting fees, state-mandated fees shall also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), and regulations adopted thereunder by EPD. In the case of a subdivision or other larger common plan of development or sale, "per disturbed acre" includes all acreage to be disturbed in the entire development. Fees for the city shall be submitted to the city including primary and secondary permittees. Fees for the state shall be submitted to the state on EPD forms available at http://www.gaepd.org. However, any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division.
d.
Review and approval. Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the city shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the city. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by paragraphs B.3.o. and p. has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the city and the district enter into an agreement which allows the city to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district.
e.
Violations. If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the city may deny the permit application.
f.
Bond. The city or WSA may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the city may call the bond to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. The development official may release a portion of the letter of credit, for the land-disturbing amount, after final stabilization is complete and all permanent vegetation and stabilization measures are in place. If the permit holder believes it is not in violation of this article such that the surety should not be drawn against, the permit holder may appeal any notice to comply to the city's mayor and city council as provided in subsection 12.04.D. of this UDO. Appeal shall be made by filing a written notice of appeal within 30 days of any notice to comply with the development official, stating the basis for the appeal. Except in emergency situations, the surety shall not be drawn against until the appeal is considered. The decision of the board of adjustments and appeals shall be final.
D.
Plan requirements.
1.
Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in this UDO, or using more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article.

F.
Inspection and enforcement.
1.
The city and Douglasville-Douglas County Water and Sewer Authority (WSA) will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the city and WSA shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.
2.
The city and WSA shall have the power to conduct such investigations as they may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
3.
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the city, WSA, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.

a.
For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the community development director shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the community development director shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the community development director shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning;
b.
For a third and each subsequent violation, the community development director shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and
c.
All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred.
d.
When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the community development director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the community development director or his or her designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site except for the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.
3.
Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 5.05. The city may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
4.
Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in the City Charter to the contrary, the Douglasville Municipal Court shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

Education and certification.
1.
Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20.
2.
For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission present on site whenever land-disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit.
3.
Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this article.
4.
If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(4) and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph.

2.
Liability.

Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the city or district for damage to any person or property.
b.
The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
c.
No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any Waters of the State as defined thereby.
