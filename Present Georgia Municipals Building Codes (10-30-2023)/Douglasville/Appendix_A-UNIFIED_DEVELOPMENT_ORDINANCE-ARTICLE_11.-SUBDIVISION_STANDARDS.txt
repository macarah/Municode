ARTICLE 11. - SUBDIVISION STANDARDS

Sec. 11.01. - Application of regulations.
A.
Subdividing land. After the adoption of this UDO, no tract of land within the City of Douglasville shall be subdivided without prior approval of the City of Douglasville in accordance with this Unified Development Ordinance, provided however the division of land into parcels of five acres or more where no new street is involved is exempt from this requirement.
B.
Recording a plat. No plat of a Subdivision shall be recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Douglas County unless it has first been approved in compliance with the regulations of this UDO.
C.
Use of a plat. The transfer of title or sale of land by reference to a plat of a subdivision that has not been approved by the City of Douglasville and properly recorded in compliance with the regulations set forth in this UDO is prohibited and shall not be recognized or qualified as a subdivision under this UDO.
D.
Erection of buildings. No building permit shall be issued, and no building shall be erected on any subdivided lot within the City of Douglasville unless that lot legally existed prior to the enactment of these regulations, or unless that lot shall first have been created in accordance with the regulations set forth in this UDO.
E.
Dedication of land and facilities. No land or facilities shall be dedicated to the City of Douglasville for public ownership or use unless that dedication is made in accordance with the regulations set forth in this UDO.
Sec. 11.02. - General requirements.
A.
Suitability of the land. Land subject to flooding, improper or inadequate drainage or erosion, if developed as proposed, and any land deemed unsuitable for development due to steep slopes, unsuitable soils, subsurface conditions or other undesirable properties, shall not be subjected to development as a lot within a subdivision for any uses that shall or may create or continue such conditions or increase danger to health, safety, life, or property. No land identified as unbuildable area or land within any delineated floodways shall be included within the buildable area of any subdivision or included within any lot of a subdivision. In addition, no undisturbed buffer that is required by any of the local development codes and ordinances to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community shall be included or within any lot proposed for a subdivision for any development.
B.
Appropriateness of location. The community development director and the planning commission should consider the following provisions when making a recommendation for approval of a subdivision:
1.
Whether the subdivision is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property;
2.
Whether the subdivision will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property;
3.
Whether the land to be subdivided has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned and in its existing use;
4.
Whether the subdivision will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools;
5.
Whether the subdivision is in conformity with the policy and intent of the comprehensive plan and/or the land use plan;
6.
Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the subdivision;
7.
Whether the subdivision can be considered environmentally adverse to the natural resources, environment and citizens of the City of Douglasville.
C.
Differences in ordinances. Whenever there is a difference between minimum standards or requirements under the regulations set forth in this UDO and those contained in any applicable zoning regulations, development regulations, building codes or other ordinances or regulations, the most restrictive shall apply.
D.
Conformance. All proposed subdivisions must conform to the adopted Comprehensive Plan of the City of Douglasville.
E.
Access. When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such lots shall be arranged and designed to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets.
No subdivision should be designed to completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land. Every development should be designed to facilitate access to adjoining properties, which are developed or anticipated to be developed in a manner compatible with or substantially similar to the subject property. Locations of inter-parcel access shall be as required by and subject to the approval of the City of Douglasville. Private streets, as may be approved under the provisions of this UDO, shall be constructed to the roadway standards of the City of Douglasville.
Sec. 11.03. - Project design standards.
A.
Standards incorporated by reference.
1.
DOT standard specifications. Unless otherwise specially set forth herein, all of the materials, methods of construction, and workmanship for the work covered in reference to street construction and storm drainage construction shall conform to the latest standard specifications of the Georgia Department of Transportation.
2.
AASHTO design standards. Design criteria and standards not specifically set forth herein shall conform to the latest edition of the AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.
3.
FHWA traffic control standards. Traffic control signs and devices, and street striping shall conform to the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devises for Streets and Highways," latest edition, published by the Federal Highway Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation.
B.
General design standards.
1.
Blocks. The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
a.
Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated.
b.
Zoning regulations as to lot sizes and dimension.
c.
Need for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic.
d.
Limitations and application of topography:
1)
Length.
a)
Blocks shall be at least 600 feet but not more than 1,800 feet in length, except as the department considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of street pattern.
b)
In blocks greater than 1,000 feet in length, one or more public easements of not more less than 20 feet in width may be required to extend entirely across the block for pedestrian crosswalks, fire protection or utilities.
2)
Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two rows of lots, except where frontage lots on arterial streets are provided, or when prevented by topographic conditions or the size of the property, or for lots along the periphery of the subdivision, in which a single row of lots may be approved.
2.
Lots.
a.
Minimum lot dimensions and areas. All lots proposed in a subdivision shall meet or exceed the area and dimensional requirements of the UDO for the zoning district in which the lots are located. The size, shape and orientation of every lot shall be subject to approval for the type of development and use contemplated.
b.
No lot shall be more than six times as deep as it is wide at the building setback line, unless excepted by the development official and engineering department for reasons of topography or irregularity of the entire tract.
c.
Authority of health department regarding septic systems and package waste water treatment systems. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed as preventing the health department, after study of the conditions existing in a proposed subdivision, from requiring that all or any portion of the area of such subdivision shall not be built upon or that the minimum lot sizes set forth in this UDO are inadequate and must be increased to ensure the protection of the public health.
d.
Adequate building sites. Each lot shall contain a site large enough for a normal building that will meet all building setback requirements and not be subject to flood or periodic inundation. Lot remnants shall be added to adjacent lots, rather than remain as unusable parcels.
e.
Arrangement. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
f.
Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of buildings so as to conform to the front building lines on both streets.
g.
Frontage on highways restricted. Residential lots shall not be platted to front directly on the right-of-way of an existing, major thoroughfare, including a state or U.S. numbered), unless the lots are served by a frontage road or a street contained within the proposed subdivision.
h.
Double and reverse frontage lots. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots are prohibited except where deemed to provide separation of residential development from a state or U.S. numbered highway (whether a collector or arterial street) or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation of property. An easement of at least ten feet in width, improved with a landscaped planted screen, across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting any such highway or a disadvantaged use.
i.
Properties adjacent to lakes. The subdividing of land adjacent to or surrounding an existing or proposed lake, shall be such that lots abutting the lake shall be drawn to the centerline of the lake. Such requirements may be waived upon submittal to the development official and department of an acceptable method for the maintenance of the lake and any recreational operations.
3.
Inter-parcel access requirements.
a.
Internal access easements required. For any office or retail sales or services use, the property owner shall grant an access easement as described in this section to each adjoining property that is zoned or used for an office or retail sales or services use. The purpose of the easement is to facilitate movement of customers from business to business without generating additional turning movements on the public street.
b.
Access easement provisions.
1)
The easement shall permit automobile access from the adjoining property to driveways and parking areas intended for customer or tenant use; but parking spaces may be restricted to use by the owner's customers and tenants only.
2)
The granting of such easement shall be effective upon the granting of a reciprocal easement by the adjoining property owner.
3)
Upon the availability of access to driveways and parking areas of the adjoining lot, the pavement or other surfacing of the owner's driveways and parking areas shall be extended to the point of access on the property line.
c.
Relief. Where the proposed land use is such that adverse impact of the required easement on use of the property would outweigh the reduced impact on the public street provided by the reciprocal easements, the department may waive the requirement for access easements, in whole or in part, administratively.
4.
Easements. Easements shall be required in connection with subdivisions or developments for the following purposes, among others:
a.
Utility easements. Whenever it is necessary or desirable to locate a public utility line outside of the street right-of-way, the line shall be located in an easement dedicated to the city (or other appropriate public entity) for such purpose. Easements for water and sanitary sewers shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide, and may be required to be wider depending on the depth of cut.
b.
Water course and drainage easements.
1)
A publicly dedicated stormwater easement or drainage easement is to be provided along any drainage channel, stream or water impoundment within a development located outside a street right-of-way. The easement is to be substantially centered on the watercourse or surround the high water line of the impoundment, and shall be of such width as the development official deems necessary for adequate access by maintenance equipment. All easements shall be no less than 20 feet wide when used as an open ditch. Piped storm drainage shall have a minimum easement width of 15 feet wide.
2)
Drainage easements off the street right-of-way shall be clearly defined on the plat and deed of the individual property owner, and such property owner shall keep the easement free of obstructions and maintain that part of the easement within the property owner's boundary line so that free and maximum flow is maintained at all times.
c.
Overlapping easements. Easements for water and sanitary sewers and drainage purposes shall not overlap unless approved by the department.
C.
Required improvements.
1.
Minimum requirements. The following improvements shall be provided by the developer or at the developer's expense in every subdivision or development in accordance with the standards contained in this article.

Existing streets that adjoin a development shall be improved to the minimum standards from the centerline of the street along the development's frontage. (Half streets are not allowed).
2)
Public streets in nonresidential areas or serving a multi-family development shall be improved to "collector" street standards. In residential subdivisions, streets that serve 100 dwelling units or more shall be improved to "collector" street standards, while those serving fewer than 100 dwelling units shall be improved to "local" street standards.
3)
The city may participate in sharing the costs of construction and installation to the extent that improvements are needed to bring the street to a higher level of classification than required to exclusively serve the subdivision or development.
4)
Curb and gutter along all roadways.
c.
All drainage structures, including channels, shall be in place, inspected by the Douglasville Douglas County Water Sewer Authority (WSA) and functioning properly prior to the start of any building construction on any lot served or adjacent to the stormwater sewer and easement.
d.
Sidewalks shall be required as provided in section 11.02.F., streets.

Sewer lines shall be connected to an existing sanitary sewerage system and extended past each lot. Every element of the sanitary sewer system, including mains, lift stations, outfalls, and laterals, shall be installed at the developer's expense by a contractor approved by WSA.
j.
Every commercial conveyor car wash permitted and constructed after August 15, 2012, regardless of the water source, shall install and maintain in good working condition a recycled water system, wherein a minimum of 50 percent of water utilized will be recycled.
2.
Gated communities. Improvements in gated communities shall meet all requirements and standards that apply to public subdivisions.
3.
Guarantee in lieu of completed improvements. No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the city or accepted for recordation by the clerk of superior court until one of the following conditions has been met:
a.
All required improvements have been constructed in a satisfactory manner and approved by the director, or
b.
The city council has received in escrow 110 percent of the estimated cost of installation of the required improvements, and has approved an executed contract for installation of the improvements by a qualified contractor. Such improvements shall be limited to final topping course on the street, sidewalks, streetlights, grassing of shoulders and deferred landscaping and all other right-of-way amenities as required by this UDO. The executed contract shall call for completion of the improvements within two year of approval of the final subdivision plat.
D.
Survey monuments. A two-inch iron pipe 16 inches in length shall be placed at all corners of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision being developed and shall be set flush or up to six inches above the finished grade. Existing permanent monuments that, in the professional opinion of a registered land surveyor, are of sufficiently durable construction may be maintained in lieu of new monuments as described above. All other street or lot corners or angle points and points of curve in each street shall be marked with an iron pipe at least three-quarters inch by 16 inches and set two inches above the finished grade. All such monuments shall be properly set in the ground and shown on the final plat and shall be approved by a registered land surveyor prior to the time of final plat approval.

b.
Every development and every subdivision shall have access to the public street system via a paved roadway.
c.
When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets.
d.
No subdivision or development shall be designed in a way that would completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land.
e.
Reserve strips controlling access to streets, alleys or public grounds shall be prohibited.
f.
Development along State and U.S. numbered highways.
1)
Where a residential subdivision abuts or contains a state or U.S. numbered highway, the department shall require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way shall be constructed as a frontage road to provide access to the lots, deep lots with rear service drives or double frontage lots shall be provided (see "lots" above). Residential lots in a subdivision shall have no direct access to a state or U.S. numbered highway.
2)
Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the department may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations as determined by the Georgia Department of Transportation.
3)
Subdivision streets that intersect a state or U.S. numbered highway shall do so at intervals of not less than 800 feet, or as required by the Georgia Department of Transportation, whichever is greater.
2.
Street classifications. Streets are classified according to the function that they serve, the type, speed, and volume of traffic they will carry and the required standards of design. The classifications of streets and roads are shown in the comprehensive plan.
3.
Relation to present and future street system.
a.
The street pattern character, extent, width, grade and location within a development or subdivision shall provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of the existing street pattern and planned streets at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum width in the section of the community involved, unless the department deems such extension undesirable. In a situation where topography or other conditions make continuous or conformance to existing streets impossible, conformance to a plan for a neighborhood approved by the development official shall be required.
b.
Existing streets that adjoin a development or subdivision boundary shall be deemed a part of the subdivision. The proposed street system within a subdivision shall have the right-of-way of existing streets extended no less than the required minimum width. Subdivisions that adjoin only one side of an existing street shall dedicate one-half of the additional right-of-way needed to meet the minimum width requirement for the street. If any part of the subdivision includes both sides of an existing street, all of the required additional right-of-way shall be dedicated.
c.
Where, in the opinion of the department, it is necessary to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication of right-of-way to the boundary of such property through the development.
4.
Design standards for streets.
a.
Arterial streets. All state or U.S. numbered highways, and other thoroughfares classified as arterials, shall meet all design requirements of the Georgia Department of Transportation.

  e.
Additional right-of-way. Subdivisions which include an existing platted street or road that does not conform to the minimum right-of-way requirements of this UDO and is identified as a transportation improvement project in the transportation plan shall provide additional width along one or both sides of such street or road so that the minimum right-of-way required by this article is established. Subdivisions abutting only one side of such a street or road shall provide a minimum of one-half measured from the center of the existing right-of-way, of the right-of-way required by these regulations.
f.
Vertical alignment of streets.
1)
Grades on arterials shall not exceed four percent; grades on collectors shall not exceed eight; grades on local streets shall not exceed 14. Grades between 12 and 14 percent shall not exceed a length of 150 feet. The grade across a cul-de-sac in all directions shall not exceed one and one-half percent. All streets shall have a minimum grade of one percent. Major and minor thoroughfare profile grades, unless specified by GDOT, shall be connected by vertical curves of minimum length in feet equal to 20 times the algebraic difference between rates of grade expressed in feet per 100; for all other streets, including local streets and alleys, not less than ten times.
2)
All changes in grade shall be connected by a vertical curve so constructed as to afford a minimum sight distance, said sight distance being measured from the driver's eyes, which are assumed to be three and one-half feet in height above the pavement surface, to an object six inches high on the pavement.
