In the event that the electronic automated reporting system becomes temporarily or permanently disabled, secondhand dealerships and secondhand dealers will be notified as soon as possible. Whenever secondhand dealers incur electronic system failures or other events that cause partial or complete loss of electronic reporting, they shall notify the police department immediately, and then make a written record on prescribed paper forms, as a substitute for timely electronic reporting, until the electronic automated reporting system is restored. Prior to making any written report as a substitute for electronic reporting, secondhand dealers shall contact the police department officer in charge of secondhand reporting, via email or documented phone call, and state the reason and circumstances of the failure. For substitute reporting, secondhand dealers shall (a) use digital cameras to collect the required photographs and shall transfer them to a portable digital storage device for submittal, and (b) take required fingerprints in ink and record them on the prescribed forms. The paper forms shall be used to record all information required by this section for electronic reporting. Secondhand dealers shall maintain a minimum three-day supply of required paper forms. Secondhand dealers shall enter into the electronic reporting system all transactions originally reported in substitute written form within 24 hours after the electronic system is restored.

The chief of police or his designee shall designate the required automated reporting system and required equipment needed. The chief of police or his designee may assess a regulatory fee to each secondhand dealer for the secondhand dealer's use of the required automated reporting system. If such a fee is assessed by the chief of police or his designee, said fee shall be an amount set by the chief of police equal to that charged by the administrator. This fee will be invoiced to the secondhand dealer and collected by the chief of police or his designee, which may be a third-party administrator of the automated reporting system.
