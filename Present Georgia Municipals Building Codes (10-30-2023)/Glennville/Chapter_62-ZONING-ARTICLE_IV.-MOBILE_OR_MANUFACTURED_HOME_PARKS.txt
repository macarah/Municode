(Ord. of 2-7-1997, § 1502)
Sec. 62-494. - Yard requirements.
No mobile home lots shall have direct access to a publicly dedicated street. All mobile home lots shall have access to an interior roadway which is no less than 30 feet in width. Such roadway shall have unobstructed access to a public street or highway. There shall be at least 20 feet between mobile homes.
(Ord. of 2-7-1997, § 1503)
Sec. 62-495. - General requirements.
(a)
Drainage. The mobile home park shall be located on a well drained and properly graded site.
(b)
Utilities. All utility wires, pipes and tanks shall be underground, except that oil tanks used as part of a central distribution system may be above the ground if fully screened from view by a wood or masonry wall or fence. Each mobile home shall be provided with municipal water and sewerage.
(c)
Refuse collection facilities. Each mobile home park shall provide refuse containers, compatible with mechanical lifting devices on city collection trucks, having a capacity of one cubic yard for each four mobile homes, so located that no mobile home is farther than 150 feet from such a container. All refuse containers shall be located on concrete stands, abutting and level with a driveway, which shall be surrounded except on the driveway side by a wood or masonry fence or wall at least six feet high.
(d)
Street widths. The minimum street widths in mobile home parks shall be as follows:
EXPAND
On-Street Parking Traffic Width (feet)
No parking on street 1-way 14
2-way 20
Parallel parking one side 1-way 20
2-way 26
Parallel parking both sides 1-way 52
  (e)
Open space. Each mobile home park shall contain one or more recreation areas totaling at least 100 square feet per mobile home, provided that no recreation area shall contain less than 2,500 square feet. No mobile home shall be more than 500 feet distant from a recreation area. Streets, driveways, parking areas and buildings are not to be included in calculating the size of recreation areas.
(f)
Buffer strip. A greenbelt, at least 20 feet in width, shall be located along all boundaries of each mobile home park, except where it is crossed by driveways.
(Ord. of 2-7-1997, § 1504)
Sec. 62-496. - Anchoring and support systems.
(a)
Each mobile home shall have provisions for support and anchoring systems, which when properly designed and installed, will resist overturning and lateral movement of the mobile home.
(b)
The provisions made for anchoring systems shall be based on the following design criteria for single-wide mobile homes:
(1)
The minimum number of ties shall be in accordance with Table 2 at the end of this article.
(2)
Ties shall be as evenly spaced as practicable along the length of the mobile home with not more than eight feet open-end spacing on each end.
(3)
When continuous straps are provided as vertical ties, such ties shall be positioned at rafters and studs. Where a vertical tie and diagonal tie are located at the same place, both ties may be connected to a single ground anchor, provided that the anchor used is capable of carrying both loadings.
(4)
Add-on sections of expandable mobile homes shall have provisions for vertical ties at the exposed ends.
(c)
Double-wide mobile homes require only the diagonal ties specified in Table 2 at the end of this article. These shall be placed along the outer side walls.
(d)
Protection shall be provided at sharp corners where the anchoring system requires the use of external cables or straps. Protection shall also be provided to minimize damage to roofing or siding by the cable or straps.
(e)
Anchoring equipment shall be capable of resisting an allowable working load equal to or exceeding 3,150 pounds and shall be capable of withstanding a 50 percent overload (4,725 pounds total) without failure of either the anchoring equipment or the attachment point on the mobile home.
(f)
Anchoring exposed to weathering shall have a resistance to weather deterioration at least equivalent to that provided by a coating of zinc on steel of not less than 0.30 ounces per square foot of surface coated.
(g)
The provisions of this section shall be followed except when the support and anchoring systems are designed by a registered professional engineer or architect, in which the circumstances described in subsections (b)(1) and (c) of this section are not applicable.
