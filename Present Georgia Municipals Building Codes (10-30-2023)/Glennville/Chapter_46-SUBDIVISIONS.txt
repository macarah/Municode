(Ord. No. 99-05B, art. III, 10-6-1998)
Sec. 46-42. - Preapplication conference and applications of record.
(a)
Preapplication review. A pre-application conference is intended to assist both the city and the applicant with regard to what type of application of record will be required for the proposed development activity. It also provides a means of exchanging information about the application process and how to develop land in conformance with the requirements and standards of this chapter. All pre-application conferences shall be governed by the following procedures:
(1)
Voluntary and required preapplication conferences. There are two types of pre-application conferences, one type which is voluntary, and another which is required. They are distinguished as follows. No administrative or formal application or submissions are required to initiate a preapplication conference.
a.
Voluntary. A voluntary pre-application conference may be arranged between the applicant and the building official or city manager for minor subdivisions, minor lot-line adjustments or re-combinations of previously plat/planted lots.
b.
Required. A pre-application conference shall be required between the applicant and building official and the city manager for all major subdivisions and planned unit developments.
(2)
Scope of consultation. Any discussions and recommendations that result from either type of pre-application conference shall be non-binding on the applicant and the city. Whenever a subdivision or planned unit development within the jurisdiction of the planning commission is proposed, the applicant may, at his discretion, consult early and informally with the building official or city manager for advice and assistance. The applicant may submit sketches and data, or a concept plan showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity and the proposed layout of the development. If the tract of land is not to be initially subdivided in its entirety, the applicant should provide sketches for the entire tract and indicate the proposed unit division of phased development boundaries.
(3)
Recommendations. Should the applicant request a pre-application conference, the building official or city manager shall return any submitted sketch plans as quickly as possible and inform the applicant of areas where the proposed plans do not comply with the requirements set forth in these regulations. However, in no instance shall the pre-application conference be made or accepted in lieu of the required plat/plans and specifications contained herein.
(b)
Administrative applications. Administrative applications may be submitted for minor subdivisions, a recombination of previously plat/planted lots, or minor lot line adjustments. The building official or city manager shall approve, disapprove, or otherwise reconcile administrative applications. The decision to approve an administrative application by the building official or city manager shall be made after consideration of all the relevant facts before him. Such relevant facts shall be measured to determine compliance with this chapter. The review procedures for an administrative application are as follows:
(1)
Approval. If the proposed minor subdivision, recombination of previously plat/planted lots, or minor lot line adjustment as set forth in the application is in compliance with this chapter, the minor subdivision, lot recombination, or lot line adjustment shall then be recorded at the county clerk of court office. Final approval will be withheld pending confirmation to the city from the clerk of courts that the plat/plan has been filed.
(2)
Disapproval. If the proposal submitted is not approved or otherwise reconciled, the reason for disapproval shall be stated in writing on the application.
(3)
Reconciliation. Any administrative application that has been formally disapproved, or deemed incomplete or deficient by the building official or city manager, may be resubmitted for proper reconciliation. An additional application fee shall not be necessary for a re-submission.
(4)
Review deadline. The building official or city manager shall issue a final determination regarding an administrative application within 30 days of the date that the application is complete and formally accepted by the building official or city manager (or designated agent) Failure by the building official or city manager to issue a final determination within the 30-day deadline shall constitute automatic approval of the application only if the applicant receives all other required local, state and federal approvals.
(c)
Formal applications. The filing of a formal application is established to allow expedient and thorough review of larger scale development projects which are more complex and require substantial review. Major subdivisions and planned unit developments are subject to the formal application process. Review of formal applications shall be subject to the preliminary and final plat/plan procedures outline in sections 46-44 and 46-45.
(d)
Coordination of review with other required local, state and federal reviews. The applicant shall be responsible for submitting applications to and receiving approval for any proposed development from other local, state and federal agencies as required by this chapter and all other applicable ordinances, regulations, and laws. At a minimum, the applicant shall submit copies of applications to such local, state and federal agencies along with the application information provided to the city. The planning commission may grant conditional approval for any municipal application upon approval by any and all local, state and federal agencies with jurisdiction to approve any aspect of the proposed development. An applicant shall not be issued a construction permit by the building official or city manager until such time that the applicant submits a copy of all required approvals from the applicable local, state and federal agencies.
(e)
Special impact studies. During review of any application, the building official or city manager, the planning commission or the city council may determine that additional specific technical information regarding the project and its potential environmental, fiscal or traffic impacts is needed. If such a determination is made, the planning commission or the city council may condition approval of an application upon preparation of a special impact study intended to analyze the potential impacts of the development on the specific areas of concern. Where preparation of a special impact study has been required, no application shall be approved until such study has been submitted with adequate time provided for review. Typically, the responsibility and costs for such a study shall be borne by the applicant, unless municipal officials determine otherwise.
(f)
Development construction phasing. Whenever a subdivision or planned unit development is proposed, the planning commission may require construction phasing, if it has been determined that there would be an undue burden on existing public infrastructure and facilities. Where it has been determined during the review of a subdivision or planned unit development application that a proposed development would exhaust or exceed the available capacity of existing public facilities including, but not limited to, roads, municipal water and sewer, fire protection, schools and police protection, the planning commission may require the applicant to submit a phased development schedule that shall demonstrate consistency and concurrency with the planning and installation of adequate public infrastructure and facilities to serve the affected development.
(g)
Application and review fees. Application fees for the pre-application conference, minor applications, formal applications (tiers I, II and III) and plan/plat/plan changes and modifications will be assessed at the time of filing of a preliminary plat/plan/plan according to the schedule on file in the clerk's office. Any tier II or tier III formal application that involves development phasing as described in this chapter shall be subject to application and review fees for each submission of a preliminary plat/plan.

Factors relevant to selection of an area for subdivision or planned development shall be considerate of land use related criteria stated in section 62-119. Other factors shall include, but not be limited to, the suitability of land as it relates to flooding, proper drainage, steep slopes, bedrock, topography, utility easements or other features or problems which may create unfavorable development conditions.
(b)
General site design guidelines. The proposed development must be designed so as to produce an environment of stable and desirable character not out of harmony with the surrounding neighborhood. The review by the planning commission shall consider the following design elements:
(1)
Privacy. Personal and individual privacy shall be maintained and balanced with the provision of public and common areas.
(2)
Variety. Interest and variety shall be sought by means of street design and changes in and mixtures of building types, heights, facades, setbacks, planting, or size of open space. The design shall be harmonious as a whole and not simply from street-to-street.
(3)
Traffic and parking. Through or commercial traffic should not be encouraged within a subdivision or a planned unit development of less than 20 acres. Proposed local or internal streets should curve to discourage the fast movement of traffic. Shared parking facilities shall be encouraged where the same parking spaces can be utilized by two or more different land uses. Group parking areas should be screened so that vehicles are substantially hidden from the street.
(4)
Flexibility. Modification of either development intensity or basic dimensional standards shall be permitted under the options provided for under planned unit development standards and those as determined by the planning commission.
(c)
Naming requirements.
(1)
Street naming. The purpose of naming streets is to provide an orderly process for identifying geographic areas and for orienting users of the street system. Naming requirements for streets shall be observed as follows:
a.
Approval. Street names and address numbers shall be subject to the approval of the building official or city manager.
b.
Duplication of names. Street names shall not duplicate nor be closely approximated phonetically to any name of an existing city street or road.
c.
Continuity of names. Any street or road which is a continuation, an approximation or logical continuation of any existing dedicated street or road or shall bear the same name.
d.
Small culs-de-sac. Small culs-de-sac which have less than five interior lots may be omitted for name purposes, when the house numbers are continuous with those of the street or road to which they have access.
e.
Street name designations. Street name designations shall be used as follows:
1.
Boulevard or parkway: shall be reserved for streets or roads designated on the highway classification map which are planned to have a median divider of sufficient size to allow for landscaping.
2.
Avenue or road: shall be reserved for streets or roads of substantial continuity such as major or minor arterials designated on the highway classification map.
3.
Street or drive: shall be reserved for streets of less continuity such as collector streets and roads as designated on the highway classification map.
4.
Court, place, circle, way or terrace: shall be reserved for streets and/or roads with no continuity.
(2)
Name of subdivision or planned unit development. Any proposed name for a subdivision or planned unit development shall not duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision or planned unit development. The planning commission shall have final authority to designate the name of a subdivision or planned unit development which shall be determined upon acceptance of the concept plan.
(d)
Access.
(1)
Intent. All subdivisions and planned unit developments shall provide adequate public access for street, utility, and pedestrian systems which shall be designed and constructed to facilitate efficient movement and circulation, to ease congestion, and to promote safety.
(2)
Design standards. Where a major subdivision or planned unit development borders on or contains an existing proposed primary arterial, the planning commission may require that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
a.
Subdivided lots bordering a primary arterial shall back onto the primary arterial and front onto a parallel local street. No access to these types of lots shall be provided from the primary arterial, and screening in the form of a buffer or screen shall be provided in a strip of land along the rear property line of such lots.
b.
Where there exists a marginal access or service road separated from the primary arterial, a planting or a grass strip shall be established and maintained and there shall be access thereto at appropriate points.
c.
The development shall have at least two entrances from a public street that are at least 100 feet apart (as measured from accessway centerline to accessway centerline along the intersecting street line). The planning commission may require additional accessways as it deems necessary to accommodate safe entrance, egress, and emergency access to the development, and for the purpose of accommodating emergency, rescue, or other critical public safety vehicles.
(e)
Comprehensive plan consistency. All subdivisions and planned unit developments, and those requirements and standards that apply are intended to serve as a device to further the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan. The review of a subdivision or planned unit development provides a comprehensive means of addressing a wide range of issues for a broad geographic area. The use of a theme or development concept will provide a basis for relating the proposed development request to standards provided for in all municipal land development regulations and the comprehensive plan. The policies of the comprehensive plan's land use element, including the future land use map, in conjunction with the preceding policies of other comprehensive plan elements, shall form the basis for reviewing proposed planned unit developments.
(f)
Modification of zoning standards for planned unit developments. The basic design and dimensional standards provided for each zoning district by the city zoning chapter for any planned unit development may be modified on the recommendation of the building official or city manager to the planning commission (and as applicable the city council), so that the property under consideration may be developed in a reasonable manner and without detriment to the public welfare and interest. Any modification is subject to review of a preliminary and/or final plat/plan, or a revised development plan. Modifications may be authorized by the planning commission to facilitate and promote innovative design options. Such innovative design options include the following:
(1)
Cluster residential development option. The purpose for cluster development is to provide flexibility and options in planned unit development design. The objectives of cluster development are to create an improved living environment which is varied, functional, cost effective, aesthetically pleasing, and capable of preserving the unique natural, physical, or cultural features of a site. Any planned unit development utilizing the cluster development option is subject to the provisions set forth in this section. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the building official or city manager, the planning commission shall determine whether a proposed cluster development complies with all the objectives, requirements and standards of this section. All cluster developments shall comply with the following general requirements:
a.
Development intensity. The development intensity for a cluster development shall not exceed standards and requirements for the applicable zoning district is located, as applied to the developable land area of the proposed development site. However, an increase in development intensity on a portion or portions of the property may be allowed through a reduction in required lot sizes, as long as any resulting residual land is preserved as common open space as specified in the zoning chapter.
b.
Density bonus. The planning commission may allow an increase in permissible development intensity of not more than ten percent if the proposed cluster development will result in substantial recreational improvements to the developable portions of the common open space. Substantial recreation improvements shall include, but not be limited to:
1.
Jogging/walking trails with exercise stations and benches and landscaping where appropriate.
2.
Ball fields, tennis courts, or basketball courts.
3.
Landscaped picnic area with tables, shelters and grills/pits for cooking.
4.
An outdoor swimming pool with protective fences.
5.
A clubhouse or other common indoor activity center.
A density bonus consistent with these provisions also may be granted if the open space will be designed to protect and preserve any rare or endangered plant or species habitat on the property. Finally, the planning commission, upon recommendation of the building official or city manager, may grant a ten percent density bonus if at least half of the bonus dwelling units will be permanently priced such that they can be afforded by a household earning 80 percent of the county's median household income. Where the density bonus is related to the provision of affordable housing units, appropriate restrictive covenants shall be placed on the affordable units to ensure that they will remain permanently affordable. Also, the planning commission may require that the designated affordable bonus housing units be distributed at random throughout the development to ensure that the affordable units are constructed and maintained in a manner commensurate with the market rate units. In determining the amount of density bonus to be extended for the aforementioned optional improvements, the planning commission may consider other factors including, but not limited to, those specified in section 46-46(2).
c.
Minimum size. A cluster development shall consist of not less than 20 dwelling units, unless the development is considered by the planning commission to be a logical extension of an existing or approved cluster development and will be designed to be compatible with said neighboring development.
d.
Types of dwellings. A cluster development may consist of a mix of all residential dwelling unit types permitted within the applicable zoning district.
e.
Open space. All open space shall be integrated into the development design such that it enhances the privacy and convenience of individual homes within the development. At no point shall an open space be less than 25 feet in width.
f.
Buffers. All buffers shall comply with standards specified in the city zoning chapter. However, the planning commission may require a buffer strip of at least 25 feet along any or all property boundaries to provide a natural separation between different housing types. Any required buffer shall be permanently vegetated and maintained as common open space. No designated buffer strip may be improved in order to acquire a density bonus.
g.
Public utilities, infrastructure, easements. All public utilities, infrastructure, easements and access requirements shall be provided as specified under by this chapter.
h.
Drainage. The planning commission may require the construction of stormwater detention or retention areas within cluster developments to prevent runoff and erosion and sedimentation impacts on neighboring developments. Where such drainage improvements are required, adequate maintenance provisions shall be included in the restrictive covenants, association bylaws or city development regulations. Any stormwater detention or retention areas shall be considered open spaces; however, they must be maintained in a natural or vegetated state, and they may not be used to satisfy the 50 percent developable land area requirement for open space within the development, as required in the city zoning chapter.
i.
Maintenance of common areas. Every cluster development shall include provisions for maintenance of all areas within the development under common ownership.
j.
Pedestrian access. Where a proposed cluster development contains multiple improved recreational facilities, adequate provision for safe pedestrian access to such facilities and open space areas shall be provided. The planning commission may require sidewalks for any cluster development if the potential traffic volumes and pedestrian activity warrant such improvements or if the development represents an extension or expansion of an adjoining residential development that contains sidewalks. Furthermore, any proposed or required sidewalks within a cluster development shall tie into existing public sidewalks that adjoin the proposed development.
k.
Compliance with state laws. All units within a cluster development under common ownership shall satisfy all applicable regulations of the "Georgia Condominium Act" (O.C.G.A. § 44-3-70 et seq.).
l.
Dimensional requirements. Cluster developments shall be constructed in accordance with the preliminary plat/plan as approved by the planning commission. Within a cluster development, the planning commission may authorize the following changes to dimensional requirements:
1.
Lot size reductions. The maximum reduction in lot sizes shall not exceed 35 percent in any zoning districts.
2.
Lot width reductions. The maximum percentage reduction in required lot widths shall be the same as for lot sizes in the respective zoning districts.
3.
Coverage and impervious surface ratios. The maximum lot coverage shall be 30 percent for each lot in all cluster developments. In addition, no more than 40 percent of all land within the cluster development may be covered by impervious surfaces, including roads, sidewalks, paved parking areas, and structures.
4.
Front yard requirements. The minimum permitted front yard setback shall be 25 feet. No reduction in front yard setbacks shall be allowed for lots fronting on a collector or arterial highway.
(2)
Zero lot line option. Upon review and approval by the planning commission, the side yard setback requirements for single-family (detached) dwelling lots may be reduced to allow a zero side yard setback on one side of a lot, provided that the following conditions are met:
a.
Any reduction in one side yard requirement shall result in a corresponding increase in the side yard requirement for the opposite side yard. In this manner, the overall side yard requirement of the district shall be met.
b.
Front yard, rear yard and corner side yard requirements of the general zoning district shall not be modified.
c.
Side yard setback requirements shall not be modified for an individual lot unless it is part of a block in which each lot's side yard setback is to be modified. The arrangement of modified side yard requirements shall allow for an open side yard area between each dwelling unit.
d.
The zero lot line provisions shall not apply to accessory buildings that are not attached to the primary residential structure.
e.
The developer of a subdivision for which modifications to the side yard setback requirements are requested shall furnish to the planning commission a copy of proposed deed restrictions, conditions or covenants. Such covenants shall include as minimum provisions:
1.
A maintenance easement of at least four feet in width, which will allow for the maintenance of exterior dwelling walls facing a zero setback line.
2.
A requirement that dwelling walls facing a zero setback be windowless.
(3)
Mixed use development option. The purpose for a mixed use development option is to encourage the development of large tracts of land as planned communities or neighborhoods; to preserve natural features; to encourage efficient development of land and public improvements; and to promulgate flexible and innovative design options. A mixed use development option allows a variety of land uses under the premise that, in the collective, each differing land use has an orderly relationship to one another.
a.
Development intensity. The development intensity for a mixed use development shall not exceed standards and requirements for the applicable zoning district in which it is located, as applied to the developable land area of the proposed development site. However, an increase in development intensity on a portion or portions of the property may be allowed through a reduction in required lot sizes, as long as any resulting residual land is preserved as common open space as specified in the city zoning chapter.
b.
Density bonus. The planning commission may allow an increase in permissible development intensity of not more than ten percent if the proposed mixed use development will result in substantial public improvements. Substantial public improvements shall include, but not be limited to:
1.
Innovative parking lot design encouraging landscaping and pedestrian access.
2.
Where residential uses are proposed, if at least 20 percent of the dwelling units will be permanently priced such that they can be afforded by a household earning 80 percent of the county's median household income. Where the density bonus is related to the provision of affordable housing units, appropriate restrictive covenants shall be placed on the affordable units to ensure that they will remain permanently affordable. Also, the planning commission may require that the designated affordable bonus housing units be distributed at random throughout the development to ensure that the affordable units are constructed and maintained in a manner commensurate with the market rate units. In determining the amount of density bonus to be extended for the aforementioned optional improvements, the planning commission may consider factors such as those specified in section 62-119.
c.
Open space. Every mixed use development shall contain common open space equal in area to the total area reduction in individual lot sizes. At a minimum, all open spaces provided shall be in compliance with the city zoning chapter. All open space shall be integrated into the development design such that it enhances the compatibility of land uses within the development. At no point shall an open space be less than 25 feet in width.
d.
Buffers. All buffers shall comply with standards specified in the city zoning chapter. However, the planning commission may require a buffer strip of at least 50 feet along any or all property boundaries to provide a natural separation between different land uses. Any required buffer shall be permanently vegetated and maintained as common open space. No designated buffer strip may be improved in order to acquire a density bonus.
e.
Public utilities, infrastructure, easements. All public utilities, infrastructure, easements and access requirements shall be provided as specified by this chapter.
f.
Drainage. The planning commission may require the construction of stormwater detention or retention areas within mixed use developments to prevent runoff, erosion, and sedimentation impacts on neighboring developments. Where such drainage improvements are required, adequate maintenance provisions shall be included in the restrictive covenants, association bylaws, or rules for the development as prescribed in city development regulations. Any stormwater detention or retention areas shall be considered open spaces; however, they must be maintained in a natural or vegetated state, and they may not be used to satisfy the 50 percent developable land area requirement for open space within the development, as required in the city zoning chapter.
g.
Maintenance of common areas. Every mixed development shall include provisions for maintenance of all areas within the development under common ownership.
h.
Pedestrian access. Where a proposed cluster development contains multiple improved recreational facilities, adequate provision for safe pedestrian access to such facilities and open space areas shall be provided. The planning commission may require sidewalks for any mixed use development if the potential traffic volumes and pedestrian activity warrant such improvements or if the development represents an extension or expansion of an adjoining residential development that contains sidewalks. Furthermore, any proposed or required sidewalks within a mixed use development shall tie into existing public sidewalks that adjoin the proposed development.
i.
Dimensional requirements. Mixed use developments shall be constructed in accordance with the preliminary plat/plan as approved by the planning commission. Within a mixed use development, the planning commission may authorize the following changes to dimensional requirements:
1.
Lot size reductions. The maximum reduction in lot sizes shall not exceed 25 percent in all applicable zoning districts.
2.
Lot width reductions. The maximum percentage reduction in required lot widths shall be the same as for lot sizes in the respective zoning districts.
(4)
Planned business center option. The purpose for a planned business center option is to provide for a range of professional, administrative, research and manufacturing uses; the operation of which is quiet and clean in order to preserve natural features; to encourage efficient development of land and public improvements; and to promulgate flexible and innovative design options. This option allows a variety of non-residential and non-commercial land uses under the premise that, in the collective, each differing land use has an orderly relationship to one another.
a.
Development intensity. The development intensity for a planned business center shall not exceed standards and requirements for the applicable zoning district, in which it is located, as applied to the developable land area of the proposed development site. However, an increase in development intensity on a portion or portions of the property may be allowed through a reduction in required lot sizes, as long as any resulting residual land is preserved as common open space as specified in the city zoning chapter.
b.
Density bonus. The planning commission may allow an increase in permissible development intensities (including floor area and impervious surface ratios) of not more than ten percent if the proposed planned business center will provide for substantial public improvements. Substantial public improvements shall include, but not be limited to:
1.
Innovative parking lot design encouraging landscaping and pedestrian access.
2.
Jogging/walking trails with exercise stations and benches and landscaping where appropriate.
3.
Landscaped picnic area with tables, shelters and grills/pits for cooking.
4.
A clubhouse or other common indoor activity center.
c.
Open space. Every planned business center shall contain common open space equal in area to the total area reduction in individual lot sizes. At a minimum, all open spaces provided shall be in compliance with the city zoning chapter. All open space shall be integrated into the development design such that it enhances the compatibility of land uses within the development. At no point shall an open space be less than 25 feet in width.
d.
Buffers. All buffers shall comply with standards specified in the city zoning chapter. However, the planning commission may require a buffer strip of at least 50 feet along any or all property boundaries to provide a natural separation between different land uses. Any required buffer shall be permanently vegetated and maintained as common open space. No designated buffer strip may be improved in order to acquire a density bonus.
e.
Public utilities, infrastructure, easements. All public utilities, infrastructure, easements and access requirements shall be provided as specified under this chapter.
f.
Drainage. The planning commission may require the construction of stormwater detention or retention areas within planned business center to prevent runoff, erosion, and sedimentation impacts on neighboring developments. Where such drainage improvements are required, adequate maintenance provisions shall be included in the restrictive covenants, association bylaws, or city development regulations. Any stormwater detention or retention areas shall be considered open spaces; however, they must be maintained in a natural or vegetated state, and they may not be used to satisfy the 50 percent developable land area requirement for open space within the development, as required in the city zoning chapter.
g.
Maintenance of common areas. Every planned business center shall include provisions for maintenance of all areas within the development under common ownership.
h.

All new streets constructed as a result of a subdivision or a planned unit development shall conform to the following standards:
(1)
Topography and arrangement. Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades (eight percent or greater) and curves shall be avoided. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be developed under planned requirements, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions. All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing county road and street system. The use of curvilinear streets, culs-de-sac, or U-shaped streets shall be encouraged where such use shall result in a more desirable layout.
(2)
Existing streets. Existing streets shall be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width.
(3)
Frontage on improved roads. No planned unit development shall be approved unless the area to be developed shall have frontage on and access from an existing dedicated public street or road.
(4)
Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner to deny access from adjacent property to such street.
(5)
Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 200 feet shall not be permitted, unless the intersected street has separated dual lanes without median breaks at either intersection.
(6)
Grading and improvement plan. Roads shall be graded and improved and shall conform to local construction standards and specifications, and shall be approved as to design and specifications in accordance with appropriate plat/plan approval.
(7)
Intersections. Unless otherwise noted, required distances between streets shall be measured from centerline-to-centerline. The following standards shall also apply:
a.
Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed new intersection of two new streets at an angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet from the end of the curve to the street intersection. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point, unless specifically approved by the planning commission.
b.
Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Where streets intersect major streets, their alignments shall be continuous. Intersection of major streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
c.
Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving a collector or arterial street shall be at least 25 feet.
d.
Intersections shall be designed at a flat grade wherever practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than two percent rate at a distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street.
e.
In a corner lot, there shall be no obstruction to vision between the height of three feet and ten feet above the average grade of each street within the triangular area formed by the intersection of two road rights-of-way and a line joining them at points 25 feet away from their intersection.
(8)
Alleys and service drives. Alleys or service drives may be required on any lots used for multifamily, commercial, industrial, or mixed use developments. They shall not be provided in single-family residential areas except where the developer provides information to the planning commission of the need for a alley or service drive.
(9)
Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited, except where absolutely essential to the reasonable development of the planned project in conformity with other requirements in this chapter. Where the planning commission finds it practicable, it may require the dedication of the other half of the street when the adjoining property is developed.

Sec. 46-121. - Design principles.
Block design shall conform to sound design principles and the length, width and the shape shall be determined with due regard to:
(1)
Zoning district requirements as to lot size.
(2)
Topographic conditions.
(3)
Need for safe, convenient access and traffic circulation.
(Ord. No. 99-05B, art. XII, § 1201, 10-6-1998)
Sec. 46-122. - Design standards for blocks.
The following standards shall apply to block design:
(1)
Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots with appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, or waterways.
(2)
The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be appropriate to the type of development contemplated and conducive to the existing street system, but block lengths for residential areas shall not exceed 2,200 feet or 12 times the minimum lot width required in the zoning district, nor be less than 400 feet in length. Wherever practicable, blocks along major arterials and collectors shall be at least 1,000 feet in length.
(3)
In long blocks, the planning commission may require the reservation of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or pedestrian traffic. Pedestrian ways, or crosswalks may be required by the planning commission through the center of blocks more than 800 feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other community facilities. Blocks designed for commercial, industrial, or mixed uses shall be of such length and width as may be determined suitable by the planning commission for prospective use.
(Ord. No. 99-05B, art. XII, § 1202, 10-6-1998)
Sec. 46-123. - Design standards for lots.
The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate to the proposed subdivision or planned unit development and shall conform to the development standards for the applicable zoning district, unless appropriate modifications have been approved. Other standards shall include the following:
(1)
No lot shall be subdivided by a city or county boundary.
(2)
Every lot shall abut a street.
(3)
Excessive lot depth in relation to width shall be avoided. A depth to width ratio of three to one shall normally be considered a maximum.

DIVISION 2. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS

Sec. 46-181. - Generally.
Prior to the approval of the final plat/plan, installation of street and utility improvements shall be made. The developer, at his own expense, shall be required to have installed street and utility improvements as required in this article.
(Ord. No. 99-05B, art. XIII, § 1301, 10-6-1998)
Sec. 46-182. - Road surfacing and improvements.
After all necessary sewer, water, and other underground utilities have been installed, the developer shall install curbs and gutters (where applicable) and shall surface or cause to be surfaced roadways to the widths described in this chapter. Said surfacing shall be of such character as is suitable for the expected traffic and in harmony with similar improvements in surrounding areas. Types of pavement shall be approved by the city road engineer or the state department of transportation. Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains, and bridges.
(Ord. No. 99-05B, art. XIII, § 1302, 10-6-1998)
Sec. 46-183. - Shoulder, curb and gutter.
Shoulders, curb, and gutters shall be installed on all applicable streets in a subdivision or planned unit development, but requirements shall vary according to street hierarchy and character of development (residential, non-residential, mixed-use) as indicated in the street design standards of this chapter. Curbing may also be required for:
(1)
For stormwater management.
(2)
Stabilizing the pavement edge.
(3)
Delineating parking areas.
(4)
Providing ten feet on either side of drainage inlets.
(5)
Intersections.
(6)
Corners.
(7)
Tight curve radii.
Where curbing is not required, edge delineation and stabilization shall be furnished to ensure safety and to prevent pavement separation. Where curbing is required, edge delineation shall be waived and shoulder and/or drainage swales used when it can be shown that shoulders are required by state law; soil or topography make the use of shoulders and/or drainage swales favorable; where it is in the best interest of the community to preserve its rural character by using shoulders and/or drainage swales instead of curbs. Flexibility regarding curb type shall be permitted as long as the curb type accommodates the system of drainage proposed. Shoulders shall measure four feet in width on each side for all applicable streets and shall be located within a right-of-way. Shoulders shall consist of stabilized turf or other materials as determined by the city road engineer or the state department of transportation. The width of swales shall be determined by site-specific conditions.
(Ord. No. 99-05B, art. XIII, § 1303, 10-6-1998)
Sec. 46-184. - Stormwater management.
The development should contain adequate stormwater management facilities to accommodate on-site the runoff that would be generated by a ten-year storm event. The planning commission may request assistance from the county soil conservation district, or the city engineer in evaluating the applicant's proposed measures to comply with this requirement. Any costs associated with this evaluation assistance shall be paid by the applicant. All drainage improvements shall tie into any available or natural drainageways along the adjoining public streets.
(Ord. No. 99-05B, art. XIII, § 1304, 10-6-1998)
Sec. 46-185. - Street lighting.
Installation of street lights may be required in accordance with design and specifications standards recommended by the local electric public utility system. However, the compatibility with the following guidelines shall be considered in developing a street lighting plan for a planned unit development:
(1)
Lighting for safety should be provided at intersections, along walkways, at entryways, between buildings, and in parking areas.
(2)
Spacing of street lights shall be equal to four times the height of the standard.
(3)
The maximum height of the standard shall not exceed the maximum building height permitted, or 25 feet, whichever is less.
(4)
The height and shielding of lighting standards shall provide proper lighting without hazard to drivers or nuisance to residents, and the design of lighting standards shall be of a type appropriate to the development and the community.
(5)
Spotlights, if used, shall be placed on standards pointing toward the building and positioned as not to blind the residents, rather than on the buildings and directed outward which creates dark shadows adjacent to buildings.
(Ord. No. 99-05B, art. XIII, § 1305, 10-6-1998)
Sec. 46-186. - Location of electrical utilities.
It is desirable for all proposed wire or cable utilities to be located underground throughout any proposed planned unit development. In those instances in which it is not feasible to provide underground utilities, the applicant must demonstrate infeasibility to the satisfaction of the planning commission. The planning commission shall have the authority to waive such requirements, at its discretion.
(Ord. No. 99-05B, art. XIII, § 1306, 10-6-1998)

All necessary traffic signs (slow, stop, caution, school bus stop, etc.) will be furnished and installed at proper locations. Materials for signs shall be approved by the planning commission, and all expenses incurred will be borne by the developer at no cost to the city.
(b)
All streets shall be designated by name on a street sign post approved by the planning commission with such post having a set of nameplates/planes of an approved material one above the other with a clearance of seven feet. The post shall be located to be visible for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. At cross-street intersections in all zoning districts other than an R-1A, R-1B, or agricultural district, two street sign posts shall be located diagonally across the intersection from each other. Only one street sign post shall be required at T-street intersections.
(Ord. No. 99-05B, art. XIII, § 1311, 10-6-1998)
Sec. 46-192. - Water supply requirements for fire suppression.
The city fire chief shall compute the minimum water supply needed for any degree of fire control for proposed developments, and will see that adequate fire flows are available to meet the needs indicated. In areas supported by public or community water systems, fire hydrants shall be distributed throughout any development with a distance of no less than 1,000 feet of distance between each hydrant. Fire protection shall be furnished for any developments connected to the public water supply system, and minimum fire flows shall be computed based on standards promulgated by the city fire chief. For those proposed developments which will not have immediate access to the public water supply system, such standards and computations should be based on the National Fire Protection Association Standards on Water Supply for Suburban and Rural Fire Fighting (ANSI/NFPA No. 1231; 07/1989).
