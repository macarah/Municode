The following regulations regarding employees shall apply to all establishments holding a license for liquor by the drink on the premises:
(1)
No person shall be employed by an establishment holding a license hereunder until such person has been issued a permit indicating that such person is eligible for this employment. However, a seven-day grace period shall be given from the date of employment until the permit is issued. The permit shall be provisional until the sheriff has had the applicant fingerprinted, photographed and cleared by the sheriff's office after a computerized background check. If the applicant's background check reveals a record that would make the employee ineligible to keep a permit, the sheriff shall revoke the permit. The permit issued to a person under this section shall be an alcohol service permit, which shall be issued only to a person who must be at least 18 years of age and who sells, serves or dispenses liquor by the drink; or is employed as a manager, host, hostess, doorman or bouncer in such establishment. A permit shall be valid for a two-year period, and shall be renewed on or before its expiration.
(2)
The sheriff or his designee shall investigate all applications for alcohol service permits made pursuant to this section. The sheriff may refuse to issue an alcohol service permit to any proposed employee who:
a.
Has been convicted of a felony within a period of five years immediately prior to the date upon which the application for an alcohol service permit was made.
b.
Has been convicted of two or more misdemeanors within two years immediately preceding the application for an alcohol service permit. Misdemeanors will be defined as violations other than minor traffic violations such as speeding, stop sign, failure to yield, following too closely, etc. The two convictions for misdemeanor violations for which the violator was convicted should have arisen at different times.

(3)
A permit shall be issued provisionally in the first seven days of employment upon a signed application and payment of the application fee having been filed with the chief of police; until a search of the criminal record of the applicant has been completed. The application fee shall be as set by the board of county commissioners by ordinance. Such application shall include, but shall not be limited to, the name, date of birth and prior arrest record of the applicant, though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only, and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order.
(4)
The sheriff shall have a complete and exhaustive search made relative to any police record of the person fingerprinted or cleared. In the event there is no record of a violation of this article, the sheriff shall issue a permit to the employee, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person fingerprinted or cleared is not eligible for employment, the sheriff shall notify by letter the applicant and the employer that this person is not eligible for employment.
(5)
It shall be the duty of all persons holding any license to sell liquor by the drink to file with the sheriff as part of their liquor by the drink license renewal application the name of the establishment, the license number and a list of all employees, with their most recent local addresses and telephone numbers, and social security numbers. An applicant for an initial license shall furnish the same information prior to the date when on-premises consumption sales are authorized to begin.
(6)
All permits issued through administrative error or through an error in completion of a background investigation can be terminated by the sheriff.
(7)
This section shall not be construed to include employees whose duties are limited solely to those of delivery driver, busboy, cook, or dishwasher.
(8)
No licensee shall allow any employee required to hold a permit to work on the licensed premises unless the licensee has on file, on the premises, a clearly legible copy of the current, valid permit of each such employee. The employee must keep the original permit on his person when at work in a licensed establishment, though it need not be publicly displayed.
(9)
In the event that any permit holder leaves the employ of a licensed establishment, the licensee shall immediately notify the sheriff's office.
(10)
All permits issued hereunder remain the property of the county and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any deputy of the sheriff's office or a state law enforcement officer with jurisdiction in such matters.
(11)
The sheriff may revoke the permit and demand its return where the employee violates the provisions of this article or becomes one who adversely affects the public health, safety, or welfare. The first such offense shall result in a suspension of the permit for 120 days. Any subsequent offense shall result in revocation of the permit, and the employee being ineligible to reapply for such a permit.
(12)
When any employee permit is revoked, the sheriff shall issue a letter to the permit holder, and a copy to the licensee for whom he works, stating that the person does not meet the requirements of this article.
(13)
It shall be unlawful for an employee whose permit has been revoked and upon whom demand for return of the card has been made, to refuse to return the card, or to alter, conceal, deface, or destroy the card.
(14)
A new search may be conducted on any person issued a permit if the sheriff receives information which warrants such a new search. If the new search reveals evidence that warrants revocation of the permit, he may revoke the permit.
(b)
Nothing herein shall in any way be construed to limit the liability of the licensee for the conduct of its employees. Any violation of this article by an employee remains a violation of this article by the licensee, who is subject to fines, suspension, or revocation as set forth herein.

Sec. 6-272. - Prohibition of certain types of entertainment, attire and conduct.
(a)
Findings; public purpose. Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Richmond County, Georgia; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Houston, Texas; Renton, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; St. Paul, Minnesota; Tucson, Arizona; Augusta, Georgia; LaGrange, Georgia; Dalton and Whitfield County, Georgia; Carrollton, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences the board of commissioners believe are relevant to the problems faced by Ben Hill County, Georgia, the board of commissioners take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the board of county commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this subsection, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity.
(b)
Enactment. The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve or disperse liquor by the drink:
(1)
The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of liquor by the drink while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing, as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or any portion of the male or female pubic hair, anus, cleft or the buttocks, vulva and genitals.
(2)
Live entertainment where any person appears in the manner described in subsection (b)(1) of this section.
