Sec. 3.06.03. - Protection criteria.
Requirement for local permit or permission. No regulated activity will be permitted within the Wetlands Protection District without written permission or a permit from Butts County. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a Wetlands Protection District boundary, as determined by the zoning administrator using the Generalized Wetlands Map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued. For purposes of this section, regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in section 3.06.04 of this article and exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
