CHAPTER 4 - SITE DESIGN STANDARDS

Sec. 4.00.00. - Generally.
Sec. 4.00.01. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide design standards applicable to all development activity within the county. This chapter also provides design standards applicable in specific situations, such as development within overlay districts or development of specific uses that require additional standards to address potential impacts.
Sec. 4.00.02. - Development standards in general.
(a)
Suitability of land. Land on which there is a danger to health, safety, or property should not be platted for residential use or other use that will continue or increase such danger when practicable, unless such hazards can be and are corrected. Examples of such conditions are as follows:
(1)
Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, or erosion.
(2)
Land with excessive slope or other physical constraints which make it unsuitable for development.
(b)
Name of subdivision. The name of the subdivision must have the approval of the planning and zoning commission. The name must not duplicate or closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision.
(c)
Access. Except where expressly provided herein, access to every subdivision must be provided over a public street, and every lot within a subdivision must be served by a publicly dedicated street or a private street approved by the planning and zoning commission.
(d)
Conformance with adopted land use plan. Proposed subdivisions should conform with the adopted Butts County land use plan and development policies in effect at the time of submission to the planning and zoning commission. When features of the Butts County land use plan such as sites for schools, public buildings, parks, major streets, or other public uses are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, such features should be either dedicated or reserved by the subdivider for acquisition within a reasonable time by the appropriate public agency.
(e)
Reservation or dedication of public use areas.
(1)
Reservation of plan features. Where the features of the Butts County land use plan such as sites for schools, public buildings, parks, major streets, or other public uses are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, such features must be reserved by the subdivider. However, no more than ten percent of the total area of the subdivision will be required for reservation to fulfill this requirement. Whenever the land required for such plan features is not purchased, acquired, optioned, or condemned by the appropriate public agency within a two-year period from the date of recording of the subdivision or by the time that at least 75 percent of the lots are built on and occupied, whichever is sooner, the subdivider may claim the original reservation and subdivide it in a manner that meets the requirements of this ordinance. Whenever a public body responsible for land acquisition executes a written release stating that the reserved land is not to be acquired, the planning and zoning commission will waive the reservation requirements.
(2)
Reservation omissions. The planning and zoning commission will not approve a subdivision plat when features specified in the Butts County land use plan are not incorporated into the subdivision plat and the reservation requirements for such features have not been waived.
(3)
Unsuitable reservations. Whenever the planning and zoning commission finds that a proposed reservation or dedication of land for public use is not suitable for such public use, it may require the rearrangement of lots to provide suitable land for public use.
(4)
Unnecessary reservations. Whenever the planning and zoning commission finds that a proposed reservation or dedication of land for public use is not necessary, it may permit the rearrangement of lots to eliminate the area proposed for such public use.
(f)
Planned developments. A planned development, including large-scale construction of housing units, streets, and off-street parking facilities, may be approved in accordance with the requirements for planned developments set forth in this ordinance. If the design of the project does not include standard streets, lots, or subdivision arrangements, departure from the normal requirements of this ordinance may be permitted if such deviations are consistent with the intent of this ordinance or are permitted in the requirements for planned developments set forth in this ordinance. If a planned development is to be phased, then each phase shall require a separate application and approval. The developer of such a proposal is urged to consult early with the planning and zoning commission to coordinate, plan, and plat properly.
(g)
Community assets. In all subdivisions, due regard must be shown for all natural features such as large trees, watercourses, historical sites, and similar community assets which will add attractiveness and value to the property if preserved.
Sec. 4.00.03. - Principles of site design and development.
Development design shall first take into account the protection of environmental and natural resources as set forth in chapter 3. All development shall be designed to avoid unnecessary impervious surface cover; to provide adequate access to lots and sites; and to avoid adverse effects of shadow, glare, noise, odor, traffic, drainage, and utilities on surrounding properties.
Sec. 4.00.04. - Applicability.
The design standards set forth in this chapter apply to all development in unincorporated Butts County.
Sec. 4.01.00. - Site design standards for base zoning districts.
Sec. 4.01.01. - Development standards for subdivision lots.
All subdivision lots established in Butts County must comply with the development standards contained in this ordinance. However, where provisions of the zoning ordinance apply and are stricter, those provisions take precedence. Development standards for lots are as follows:
(a)
Lot lines. As far as practical, side lot lines must be perpendicular or radial to street lines.
(b)
Jurisdictional limits and lot lines. Subdivision lots must not be divided by city or county boundary lines.
(c)
Lot frontage arrangements. Land must be subdivided in a manner that provides each lot in the subdivision with direct abutting access to an existing public street or to an approved private street contained within the proposed subdivision. Each lot must front for at least 60 feet upon an approved street or road. Flag lots are prohibited in subdivisions unless topographic conditions or the shape and orientation of the property to be subdivided make the inclusion of some flag lots necessary. Flag lots are not intended to provide access to other properties so as to circumvent the street and right-of-way requirements of this ordinance. When such a lot is allowed, the street frontage of each panhandle access must be at least 60 feet wide and no more than 500 feet long. No more than two such panhandle access points may abut each other or be closer than 1,000 feet apart. A flag lot is intended only to provide a means of using the rear portion of an extremely deep tract of land for residential purposes.
(d)
Adequate building sites. Each subdivision lot must contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of existing easements or building setback lines required by this ordinance or any existing ordinance as is appropriate.
(e)
Double or reverse frontage lots. Double and reverse frontage lots, unless required by the planning and zoning commission, are prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of slope, orientation, or property size. A reserve strip planted with a vegetative screen across which there is no right of access may be required along the line of lots abutting a traffic artery or other such incompatible use.
(f)
Commercial and industrial lots. Size, shape, and arrangement of commercial and industrial lots, where platted and classified as a subdivision, are subject to the approval of the planning and zoning commission.
(g)
Lot remnants. Lot remnants are prohibited. Such remnant areas must be added to adjacent lots, rather than remain as unusable parcels.
(h)
Monuments. Solid steel rods at least one-half inch in diameter or square and two feet long must be set at all street corners, at all points where street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the subdivision, at angle points in streets, at points of curve in streets, and at points of change of direction in the exterior boundaries of the subdivision. The top of the monument must have an indented cross to identify the finished grade. All other lot corners must be marked with solid steel rods no less than one-half inch in diameter, and at least two feet long, driven so as to be flush with the finished grade.
Sec. 4.01.02. - Design standards for lots.
The following regulations apply to properties in all zoning districts, unless the regulations of a particular zoning district expressly provide otherwise.
(a)
Sight distance. In order to ensure maintenance of adequate sight distances at intersections, no fence, wall, shrubbery, or other obstruction to vision between the heights of three feet and 15 feet above the ground is permitted within 20 feet of the intersection of the rights-of-way of streets or of streets and railroads.
(b)
Applicability to land, buildings, and open space. No building, structure, land, or open space may be used or occupied—and no building or structure or part of a building or structure may be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered — unless in conformity with all of the regulations specified for the district in which it is located.
(c)
Every use must be on a lot. No building or structure may be erected or use established unless upon a lot.
(d)
Only one principal building per lot. Only one principal building and its accessory buildings may be erected on any lot, except for planned developments or as otherwise provided.
(e)
Open space not to be encroached upon. No open space may be encroached upon or reduced in any manner except in conformity with the setback, off-street parking spaces, and other such required development standards contained in this ordinance. Shrubbery, driveways, retaining walls, fences, curbs, and buffers are not considered to be encroachments of setbacks. Open space areas as required by this ordinance must be permanently maintained as open space in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance.
(f)
Reduction of setbacks or lot area. Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, a lot existing at the time of passage of this ordinance may not be reduced, divided, or changed as to produce a tract of land which does not comply with the minimum dimension or area requirements of this ordinance for the district in which it is located unless that reduction or division is necessary to provide land which is needed and accepted for public use.
(g)
Lots with multiple frontage. In the case of a corner lot or double frontage lot, front setback requirements apply to all lot lines abutting a street.
(h)
Landlocked lots. In the case of a landlocked lot (a lot without direct access to a public street or road) lawfully existing as of the effective date of this ordinance, the property owner is entitled to one building permit, as long as all of the following requirements are met:
(1)
No other principal building exists or is being constructed on the property.
(2)
No other valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance and is currently valid.
(3)
The property was and continues to be under single ownership since the effective date of this ordinance.
(4)
The property owner has acquired a 60-foot easement to a city-maintained, county-maintained, or state-maintained street or road, and the easement has been duly recorded and made a part of the property deed.
(5)
In the event the property is divided, no additional permits will be issued.
Within the A-R district only, tracts of land which are accessible only by recorded easement may be divided one time only into no more than three lots when each new lot will be accessible by the recorded easement and shall in all other aspects comply with the requirements of this UDO. Any lot so created shall not be eligible for further division until such time as the lot has the required amount of road frontage except by approval of the planning commission.
(i)
Street frontage. Except where expressly provided herein, no principal building may be erected on any lot which has less than 60 feet of immediate frontage on at least one public street.
(j)
Setbacks and other spaces. No part of a setback, other open space, off-street parking, or loading space required for another building may be included as a part of the setback, off-street parking, or loading space required for another building, except as specifically provided for in this ordinance.
(k)
Substandard lots. Any lot existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance which has an area or a width which is less than required by this ordinance is subject to the following exceptions and modifications:
(1)
Adjoining lots in same ownership. When two or more adjoining and vacant lots are within a non-approved development with continuous frontage and are in single ownership at the time of application and such lots have a frontage or lot area less than is required by the district in which they are located, such lots must be replatted so as to create one or more lots which conform to the minimum frontage and area requirements of the district.
(2)
Single lots. When a lot has an area or frontage which does not conform with the requirements of the district in which it is located, but was a lot at the effective date of this ordinance, such a lot may be used for any use allowed in the zoning district in which it is located as long as all other requirements of this ordinance are met.
(l)
Encroachment on public rights-of-way. No building, structure, service area, required off-street parking, or loading/unloading facility is permitted to encroach on public rights-of-way.
(m)
Physical design standards. Minimum design standards for driveways, loading areas, and other such physical site improvements are contained in applicable development regulations of Butts County. Consult that document for specific requirements.
(n)
Off-street parking and service requirements. Minimum standards for off-street parking and service requirements are contained in the Butts County standard for off-street parking and service facilities [See chapter 6].
(o)
Other applicable development regulations. Information concerning any other applicable development regulations may be obtained by consulting the zoning administrator.
(p)
Signs. Signs are permitted on all lots, subject to the regulations contained in the Butts County sign regulations.
Sec. 4.01.03. - Design standards for structures in rural zoning districts and residential zoning districts.
(a)
The following additional regulations shall apply in the R-1 district:
(1)
Minimum roof pitch: 5:12 (five feet of rise for each 12 feet of run).
(2)

(3)
Firewalls: All side and rear walls of attached dwelling units which are less than ten feet from the lot line must be firewalls. (See Georgia Building Code for construction standards.)
(d)
Nonresidential primary use structures in residential zoning districts. In order to ensure that nonresidential uses allowed in residential districts are consistent with the residential nature of the district, where a nonresidential primary use is permitted by this ordinance on a lot zoned R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4 or R-5, such building shall be no larger than 10,000 square feet in area.
Sec. 4.01.04. - Design standards for structures in commercial, office, and institutional zoning districts.

Sec. 4.01.05. - Structure numbering.
(a)
Designation of street names and numbers. Streets now being maintained by the county and other public agencies within the unincorporated county shall in the future be named and numbered as now designated on the official map and official index of the county as amended by each implementing resolution. Every other street within the unincorporated county shown on the official index shall hereafter be referred to as designated on the official index for structure numbering purposes.
(b)
Designation of structure numbers. The emergency management director shall keep a record of all numbers assigned under this section. Such records may be maintained in data processing storage systems if so desired. Structure numbers for dwelling units, places of business, industrial locations and all other structures and uses requiring same shall be assigned by:
(1)
The emergency management director in conjunction with the United States Postal Service during the implementation stage of the system; and
(2)
The emergency management director following the implementation phase of the system.
(c)
Posting of designated structure numbers. The owner, occupant or person in charge of any dwelling unit, structure or use to which a number has been assigned shall be notified in writing by the implementing agency of the number assigned to the same. Within 60 days after receipt of such written notification, the owner, occupant or person in charge of any dwelling unit, structure or use to which a number has been assigned shall cause the same to be posted in either one or two locations depending on the following conditions:
(1)
If the mailbox is located on the same side of the street and adjacent to the driveway or curb cut, the number shall be affixed to the mailbox in letters two inches in height or larger and of a color contrasting with the color of the mailbox. This section does not preclude an individual from also numbering the front entrance of the structure if so desired.
(2)
If the mailbox is not on the same side of the street and adjacent to the driveway or curb cut, the number shall be posted at two locations:
a.
On the mailbox as prescribed by U.S. Postal Service regulations; and
b.
Either on the structure front if visible from the street or on an aboveground sign attached to a post or other object at the driveway or curb cut. The numbers shall be two inches in height or larger and of a color contrasting with the color of the background. This section does not preclude an individual from also numbering the front entrance of his structure if so desired.
(3)
In the case that a building is served by two or more driveways or curb cuts, the number shall be assigned and posted to the front entrance or driveway.
(4)
It shall be the duty of the owner, occupant or person in charge of the dwelling unit, structure or use, upon affixing the new number, to remove any different number which might be mistaken for or confused with the number assigned to the structure.
(5)
In such cases where the assigned number cannot be posted as required above, the number shall be posted as prescribed by the emergency management director after consultation with the owner.
(d)
Types of numbers. Two types of numbers are used under this section:
(1)
A primary number to be assigned to each street frontage of each parcel of land, whether or not the parcel is occupied. The primary number is required to be posted only if the parcel is occupied by a dwelling unit, structure or active use and the owner, occupant or person in charge is notified under section 4.01.05(c). Other primary numbers are reserved for future development of the numbered parcels and will be assigned at the time of development.
(2)
Secondary numbers may be used when a number of units, structures and uses coexist on the same parcel of land. Examples of parcels requiring secondary numbers include apartment projects, condominium projects, manufactured home developments, office parks, recreational vehicle parks, recreational areas, shopping centers and other uses where the use of secondary numbers would clarify the location of a unit or use for public safety purposes. To provide secondary numbers, the emergency management director shall work with the owner, manager, or person in charge of the project to determine a logical numbering system under the following guidelines:
a.
Existing numbered units and uses shall retain the present set of addresses with only the primary number being changed if the primary number is not in sequence with the overall system.
b.
Buildings on a single parcel with more than one and less than five units may be given a number designation as requested by the owner.
c.
A single building on a single parcel of land and with five or more units may be given numerical designations such as Suite 5, Apartment 5, etc., if so desired.
d.
Multiple buildings on the same parcel of land may be given secondary numbers consisting of number designations if the buildings are accessed from a main entrance to the project. Generally, the number designations should increase in a clockwise direction from the main entrance.
e.
Manufactured home developments, recreational vehicle parks, and similar uses shall be given number designations for lots or sections and number designations for individual lots or sites.
(e)
Implementation in stages. Because of the large and complex nature of the county and the existing numbering system now in place in some portions of the unincorporated county, this section shall be implemented in stages covering small sections of the entire area by the adoption of implementation resolutions for each section of the county. It shall be the policy of the county not to change existing numbered addresses if the existing system follows a logical and expandable order.
(f)
Exempt and excluded structures. Those structures that do not present a significant danger to human life if destroyed by fire or other events shall be excluded from the provisions of this section. The following structures shall be excluded from the provisions of this section:
(1)
Agricultural buildings not requiring a separate mailing address such as a barn, poultry house, outbuilding or equipment storage buildings. Buildings used as dwelling units, offices, or the normal work station of an employee shall not be exempt from the provisions of this section.
(2)
Storage and accessory buildings for the use of the occupant of another building on the property. Buildings used as dwelling units, offices, or the normal work station of an employee, or requiring a separate mailing address, shall not be exempt.
(g)
New structure and lots.
(1)
Structure numbers will be assigned to each new lot, tract or building site on the original drawings of a final subdivision plat or other plan requiring the approval of the building inspector or by the planning and development department.
(2)
No building, electrical, plumbing or mechanical permit for any new, remodeled or repaired structure will be issued by the building inspector following the implementation of this section in the affected area of the county until the owner, developer or builder has procured from the emergency management director the official structure number or numbers. Final approval for a certificate of occupancy of any principal building erected or repaired, or use requiring such number, shall be withheld until permanent and proper numbers have been displayed in accordance with the standards of this section.
(h)
Utility company compliance. Following the implementation of this section in any area of the county, all utility services regulated by the Georgia Public Service Commission or any utility cooperative service organization shall withhold service from any building until the owner or other requesting party has furnished the utility with a valid structure number.
Sec. 4.02.00. - Site design standards for I-75 Corridor Overlay District.
Sec. 4.02.01. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
Attractive and integrated architectural and site design features tend to improve an area's image, raise overall property values, attract new businesses and residents, and improve the quality of life. There is a positive return on investment for providing attractive design features, for both government and property owners, and can provide similar enhancements to public safety, community health, and well-being.
(b)
This article establishes an overlay district for a defined area in the Interstate 75 corridor for the purposes of controlling land uses, setting standards and requirements for development, and providing for improved architecture and site design.
(c)
This article also identifies future road corridors in the overlay district. In addition, the overlay reserves land needed for future roads to provide a basis for provisioning of transportation facilities along with new development by designating corridors where the construction and improvement of transportation facilities are expected. Moreover, the overlay restricts the construction or expansion of permanent structures in the intended right-of-way of planned roads and protects the rights of landowners whose land is reserved.
(d)
This article helps to ensure road and highway access to foster economic development by predetermining appropriate routes of access to state routes and the county road system for properties within and near the corridor in a manner that protects private property rights, ensures public safety, and provides reasonable access and connectivity according to locally-determined standards.
Sec. 4.02.02. - Map of overlay district boundaries.
The map entitled "Interstate 75 Corridor Overlay District, Butts County, Georgia," which is hereby made a part of this ordinance, is hereby adopted.
Sec. 4.02.03. - Relationship to zoning districts.
This article establishes regulations that are in addition to the regulations of the underlying zoning district. Zoning districts listed in chapter 2, established in this ordinance, and as applied by the official zoning map, shall continue to apply, except as specifically modified by this article. This article imposes more restrictions on land uses than the rights conferred by underlying zoning and more land development standards than are applied outside the overlay district.
Sec. 4.02.04. - Relationship to environmental and watershed overlay districts.
Overlay districts listed in chapter 3, established in this ordinance, shall continue to apply, to the extent they involve property in this overlay district, unless specifically stated otherwise in this article.
Sec. 4.02.05. - Establishment of subareas.
(a)
Character of subareas. Within the overlay, there are distinct subareas that have different aims and requirements. The three subareas are:
(1)
Industry/commerce. Focuses on light industrial uses and supporting commercial uses adjacent to the I-75 highway.
(2)
Mixed-use. Focuses on walkable commercial, retail, and some residential as a local and regional destination.
(3)
Rural neighborhood. Similar to traditional neighborhood design, rural neighborhood focuses on walkable smaller neighborhoods but does not include a mix of uses.
(4)
Refer to the map "Interstate 75 Corridor Overlay District, Butts County, Georgia" for a determination of the applicable subarea.
(b)
Definitions. The phrase "non-industrial areas" as it is used in this article refers to mixed-use and rural neighborhood areas within the overlay. "Industrial areas" refers to those designated as part of the industry-commerce area as used in this article.
Sec. 4.02.06. - Regulation of uses.
(a)
Restrictions. Notwithstanding the permitted uses and special uses sections of the zoning districts established in this zoning ordinance, the following uses as defined shall not be permitted within the overlay district boundaries:
(1)

Salvage yards.
(24)
Slaughterhouses.
(25)
Solid waste handling facilities.
(26)
Truck stops; except that a facility with no more than 30 percent of the developed area being committed to the fueling of commercial trucks with diesel fuel will be permitted in the overlay district, on the west side of I-75 only, when it is within a mixed use development (P-M zoning district) of 20 acres of more.
(27)
Truck, utility trailer, and recreational vehicle rental and leasing (does not prohibit sales) and other similar uses including, but not limited to, those classified under 2007 NAICS Code 532120.

(d)
Places of worship. Churches, synagogues, and similar places of worship shall not be located within a storefront where other leased spaces may be available for office, retail, and commercial service. Places of worship, where permitted, must have all principal buildings devoted for such uses located at least 300 feet from any property line. The purpose of this regulation is to prevent the location of churches in a way that would hinder the reasonable accommodation of alcoholic beverage service and alcoholic beverage sales within the overlay district.
(e)
Communication towers. Communication towers, including wireless telecommunications facilities and equipment, shall be set back a minimum of twice the tower's height from the right-of-way of Interstate 75 or other arterial, collector, or local county road.
Sec. 4.02.07. - General procedures.
(a)
Rezoning, special uses, and variances processes. If a property must be rezoned, or the development requires a special use or a variance in order to allow the proposed use or development proposal, such rezoning, special use, and variance processes remain independent of the special procedures of this article.
(b)
Rezoning, special uses, and variances standards for review. When an application for rezoning, special use, or variance is proposed in the overlay district, said application shall be reviewed for compliance with the requirements of this article, and failure to meet the regulations of this article shall be cause to deny such applications. When an application for rezoning, special use, or variance is proposed in the overlay district, said application shall be reviewed for consistency with the site design guidelines or adopted by reference in design guidelines for the overlay district, as applicable. An application for rezoning, special use, or variance pertaining to property within this overlay district should demonstrate compliance with the site design guidelines established in this article. Conditions of approval may be placed on the application to ensure compliance with the requirements or design guidelines of this article.
(c)
When an application for rezoning, special use, or variance is proposed in the overlay district, and such application requires the submission of architectural renderings or elevations of representative building types, the applicant should demonstrate that the proposed architecture of structures is consistent with the architectural guidelines of this article in addition to any other requirements and guidelines of the underlying zoning district. Inconsistency with such regulations or guidelines can be as a basis for disapproving such a rezoning, special use, or variance.
(d)
Preliminary plats. Development in this overlay district is subject to the preliminary and final plat requirements of chapter 10 of this UDO, when applicable. The additional requirements, standards, and guidelines for site design established in this article shall be considered during the process of reviewing and approving a preliminary plat.

Sec. 4.02.08. - Architectural review.
(a)
Required. This section outlines an administrative architectural review process. The applicant shall pay for all required fees involved within the architectural review process. The following activities and processes, when proposed within the area that is subject to this article, shall require architectural review:
(1)
Any principal building which is used or intended to be used for industry, commerce, office, institution, or multi-family residence.
(2)
Any addition to a principal building of more than 2,000 square feet or ten percent of the base square footage, whichever is lower, to a principal building which is used or intended to be used for industry, commerce, office, institution, or multi-family residence.
(3)
Entrance monument signs or displays to office parks, commercial and industrial uses, all subdivisions, and planned or condominium developments, including those for detached, single-family dwellings and manufactured homes.
(b)
Not required. The following accessory and principal buildings, when proposed within the area that is subject to this article, shall not require architectural review as established by this article:
(1)
Individual, detached single-family dwellings and manufactured homes when located on their own fee-simple lot are specifically exempt from architectural review, as are any customary accessory buildings and structures on the same lot.
(2)
Buildings related to agriculture or forestry.
(3)
Any principal building, addition thereto, or accessory building or addition thereto, which is found by the zoning administrator to be consistent with private covenants establishing architectural controls that have been reviewed and accepted by Butts County.
(4)
Nonconforming land uses that are not permitted by this article to be established in the overlay district, but which existed at the time this overlay district is made effective, may continue to exist without the requirement for an architectural review.
(c)
Relationship of architectural review to other permit processes.
(1)
The process of subdivision, as established and regulated by chapter 10 of this UDO, shall remain independent of and unaffected by the architectural review process which shall only occur after approval of a preliminary plat when required.
(2)
The process of construction plan approval and issuance of land disturbance permits, as established and required by chapter 10 of this UDO, may be concurrent with architectural review.
(3)
Where no land disturbance permit is required, the process of architectural review shall take place prior to the issuance of a building permit.
(4)
The process of architectural review shall take place concurrently with site plan review. All application materials required for architectural review are referenced in section 4.02.09(d).
Sec. 4.02.09. - Process for architectural review.
(a)
Generally. The county zoning administrator is authorized to distribute application forms and more specific procedures for architectural review which shall be consistent with the requirements of this section. The county architect shall hereafter refer to either an architect employed directly by the county or an architect serving as a consultant to the county for the purpose of architectural review.
(b)
Pre-application conference. All applicants for architectural review and approval may schedule a free pre-application conference with the county zoning administrator. A pre-application conference is a time where applicants can familiarize themselves with the application requirements and processes and gain preliminary input from staff as to the suitability of the proposed material change in appearance. Upon showing that there is an approved site plan for the property, the applicant may initiate an application for architectural review if architectural review is required.
(c)
Fee. At the time an application is submitted, the applicant shall submit, and the zoning administrator shall collect on behalf of the county, a fee for architectural review. The fee for architectural review shall be as set forth in a fee schedule adopted by the board of commissioners, as may be amended from time to time. At the discretion of the board, the fee schedule may vary based on the type of building or size of the building as to whether the architectural review is for a single, principal building or for multiple principal buildings, or the complexity of review. Said fee shall be used to offset the administrative costs to the county of processing such applications and shall be set at a level that compensates the services of an architect hired by the county for purposes of architectural review.
(d)
Application materials for architectural review. All applications for architectural review shall be made as required by the zoning administrator and shall at minimum contain the following information:
(1)
Elevation drawings. Three color copies of exterior elevation drawings of all four facades of all buildings, drawn to scale and signed by an architect, engineer or other appropriate professional, and one electronic file copy in PDF format. Exterior elevation drawings shall clearly show in sufficient detail the exterior appearance and architectural design of buildings or proposed change(s) to buildings or structures. Each application shall also indicate proposed materials, textures and colors. The zoning administrator may require that the applicant provide samples of materials and colors.
(2)
Surrounding area. Photographs of all adjacent parcels that clearly show any structures and the character of the land are required to see the character of the site. Photographs shall be submitted in printed copy and in digital form unless otherwise specified by the zoning administrator.
(3)
Existing structures. All applications involving existing buildings or structures or alteration thereof shall be accompanied by photographs of all sides of the existing building(s) or structure(s) affected and of adjoining properties. Photographs shall be submitted in printed copy and in digital form unless otherwise specified by the zoning administrator.
(4)
Site plan and landscaping plan. A copy of the proposed site plan and landscape plan shall be included with the submission of elevation drawings.
(e)
Completeness check. Upon submission of an application for architectural review and payment of the required fee, the zoning administrator shall review the application for completeness. Incomplete applications shall be refused and will not be processed until complete.
(f)
Authority, review and disposition. The county architect shall have final authority to review and approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove applications for architectural review. Depending on the nature of the application and its complexity, the zoning administrator shall determine whether review is by a consulting architect. The process of architectural review shall not exceed 30 days from the date such application was deemed complete, except by mutual agreement of the zoning administrator and the applicant.
(g)
Applications for architectural review. The zoning administrator shall consider the appropriateness of the application in the context of the following criteria:
(1)
Consistency with any adopted design guidelines.
(2)
Consistency and compatibility of the proposed application with the nature and character of the surrounding area.
(3)
The general design, character and appropriateness of design, scale of buildings, arrangement, texture, materials, and colors of the structure and the relation of such elements to similar features of structures in the immediate surrounding area, site, and landscaping.
(h)
Approved applications for architectural review shall bear the signature of the zoning administrator and the county architect, and one copy of the approved and signed plans shall be returned to the applicant; at least one copy of said approved plans shall be maintained in the office of the zoning administrator. If the plans are approved, the signature on the plans by the zoning administrator and the county architect as well as notice, verbal or written, that the plans have been approved and are ready for pick up by the applicant shall be the only notice required. Any applications that are conditionally approved shall require the applicant to submit three copies of the final, as approved plans and elevation drawings.
(i)
If the application for architectural review is not approved, the zoning administrator shall at the conclusion of the review period submit in writing to the applicant the reasons for disapproval with specific reference to code sections not met, design guidelines not complied with, or inconsistency with the criteria for architectural review for applications specified in this article. In addition, the zoning administrator may submit to the applicant a marked up copy of the plans and elevations submitted, conveying comments on said plans where revisions are needed.
(j)
Revision and resubmission. At any time after receiving the disapproval of an architectural review application, the applicant may revise and resubmit the application. A resubmittal fee shall be required, and the process shall follow the same time limits and procedures specified in this section for first-time applications. Any applications that are conditionally approved shall require the applicant to submit three copies of the final, as approved plans and elevation drawings.
(k)
Appeal. The decisions of the zoning administrator shall be final unless an appeal is made by the property owner subject to the provisions set forth in section 10.03.00.
(l)
Records. The zoning administrator shall keep records of all applications for architectural review, and the zoning administrator shall keep records of the disposition of all applications for architectural review. Such records shall be open to public inspection.
(m)

Building permits. No building permit shall be issued for a building that would be inconsistent with the requirements of this article. No building permit application required to undergo architectural review as required by this article shall be approved until architectural review has been completed in accordance with the requirements of this article. The chief building official may place conditions of approval on a building permit to ensure compliance with the requirements or design guidelines of this article.
Sec. 4.02.10. - Future roads.
(a)
All future roads.
(1)
In the event that a subdivision or land development proposes to access a substandard road, improvements shall be considered through a development agreement. Substandard roads are defined here as roads that do not meet right-of-way pavement width and/or county road standards. If the abutting substandard road provides the access to the subdivision or land development, the substandard road shall be upgraded to county standards for a local roadway from the subdivision or land development along the route of primary access to the nearest standard paved road.
(2)
The zoning administrator may require a traffic impact study for land developments or subdivisions that are anticipated to increase traffic volumes by more than ten percent. The study will determine the most appropriate road improvements, including driveway locations, and used as a basis for determining improvements required to the road system.
(b)
Future roads west of I-75. Due to the industry-commerce land uses programmed for areas west of I-75 in the overlay district, the road network must be laid out to maximize access to both State Highways 16 and 36. All new roads in the overlay district must meet the applicable Butts County or Georgia DOT standards for roadway construction.
(c)
Parcels adjacent to the eastern side of the I-75 right-of-way.
(1)
Frontage road east of I-75. In order to maximize visibility of and provide access to the mixed uses planned for areas east of I-75, a frontage road located parallel to I-75 must be constructed when developing properties adjacent to I-75. The minimum required right-of-way for the frontage road shall be 90 feet. The frontage road shall have two lanes plus a center turn lane with low level landscaping on either side and adequate space for a six-foot wide sidewalk on the developed side of the road. The frontage road shall be developed according to the applicable Butts County or Georgia Department of Transportation standards. Intersections with State Highways 16 and 36 must meet minimum Georgia DOT standards for distance from interstate highway interchanges. The exact placement of the frontage road right-of-way will be determined on a parcel by parcel basis as development occurs and funding is available.
(2)
Land adjacent to the eastern side of the I-75 right-of-way is hereby considered reserved for future intended use as a county frontage road right-of-way. The county shall not issue a subdivision plat, land disturbance, development, building or any other permit for development or building within a frontage road reserve area until the frontage road serving the development is under construction.
(3)
Each applicant for a permit to develop a parcel existing on the date of adoption of this section, within the area "reserved" for the frontage road, shall design the development proposal or subdivision plat in a manner that will not encroach upon the land designated to accommodate the frontage road.
(4)
Curb cut distance. A minimum distance of 500 feet shall be established between curb cuts onto the frontage road. New development along the frontage road shall be designed to provide inter-parcel access with adjoining tracts.
(5)
The frontage road shall be constructed from property line to property line according to applicable county and Georgia Department of Transportation standards. When a development is constructed in phases, only that portion of the frontage road serving the development phase may be required to be constructed concurrent with that phase of development.
(6)
Temporary turnarounds. Where the end of the frontage road will not connect with the existing road or driveway network, a temporary paved turnaround shall be provided by the developer and in compliance with applicable county and Georgia Department of Transportation standards.
(7)
Alternative routes. In cases where the applicant determines that such a reservation or right-of-way dedication is not practical or possible, the applicant shall determine and propose an alternative route for the frontage road corridor on the same lot, or on adjacent land owned by the permit applicant if applicable, so that the public purpose of providing a road connection through the lot is met while accommodating the development proposal.
(8)
Permit required. It shall be unlawful to initiate or carry out development upon land reserved for the frontage road without first securing a permit as required by this section.
(9)
Hearing on permit. Upon receiving an application for a permit involving reserved land, the zoning administrator shall arrange for the application to be scheduled for public hearing before the Butts County board of commissioners. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the date, time, and place of the hearing, by registered mail at least 15 days prior to the public hearing. The public shall be given notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least 15 days prior to the public hearing of the date, time, place, and nature of the hearing. At the hearing, the applicant or official representative shall have an opportunity to present evidence and argument in support of his or her application, as shall any government or individual that has an interest in the application.
(10)
Action on permit. Following the public hearing, the board of commissioners may take one of the following actions:
a.
Approve the permit as proposed, with or without conditions;
b.
Remove all or part of the reserved land and issue, with or without conditions, the permit authorizing development on the land removed from the corridor;
c.
Allow the applicant to relocate the reserved land to another part of the same parcel of land for which a permit is requested and issue, with or without conditions, the permit authorizing development on the land outside the reserved land;
d.
Modify the proposed permit application and issue it for development as modified, with or without conditions, if the development can reasonably be accomplished on the subject parcel without encroaching on the reserved land; or
e.
Delay action on the permit for a defined period of time not to exceed six months for the purpose of any of the following:
1.
Negotiating with the property owner for the purchase of all or a part of the reserved land by the county or other governmental agency;
2.
Acquiring the reserved land voluntarily;
3.
Acquiring a negative easement over the reserved land that prevents the property owner from building on the reserved land; or
4.
Taking the reserved land through eminent domain and the payment of just compensation to the property owner.
f.
Authority to acquire land for public use. After delaying action on the permit, the county may, but shall not be obligated to, negotiate for the voluntary dedication of the land, enter into an option to purchase, or use its powers of eminent domain and initiate condemnation proceedings subject to applicable state law and the payment of just compensation to the property owner.
(11)
Final action on permit. If the county delays action on the permit as provided by this section, and the county or other responsible governmental agency fails to arrange for the legal acquisition of all or a part of the reserved land within the specified time period which shall not exceed six months, then the county may approve the permit, with or without conditions, or in the absence of such approval, the permit can be deemed approved as submitted.
(12)
Inapplicability of reservation provision of development ordinance. In cases where this section applies, the procedures established in this section shall supersede the requirements of section 4.00.02(e), with respect to future major streets.
Sec. 4.02.11. - Grading and construction of roads.
(a)
Intent. Land adjacent to the eastern side of the I-75 right-of-way is reserved for the construction of frontage road with 90 feet right-of-way. Such a road is intended to be constructed without cost to the county to access the mixed use properties to be developed in the area. The Butts County subdivision regulations generally prescribe new road standards for the construction of new roads within land that is subdivided for the purpose of accessing property to be developed. The subdivision regulations do not prescribe exact locations for roads. In prescribing the approximate location of the frontage road, the county seeks to maximize the visibility of businesses that will locate in the I-75 corridor to ensure their success. The developers of these properties will thereby benefit from the installation of said frontage road.
(b)
Development agreement. The board of commissioners may negotiate a development agreement with any development applicant with regard to fire, parks and recreation, police, library services, and the grading and/or installation of road improvements.
(c)
Negotiating the development agreement. The applicant for development proposal may propose, and the county may agree to, any of the following as appropriate to the specific context:
(1)
The development applicant may voluntarily agree to pay for the entire cost of grading and provide all of the road improvements;
(2)
In cases where the full costs of road improvements are not proportional to the amount, type, or intensity of development proposed by the applicant, the applicant may submit a study prepared by a traffic engineer or transportation planner documenting the probable trips generated by the development. The results of the study will be compared to the total capacity of the road improvement, as accepted by the county, in order to arrive at a proportionate share the development would benefit from the proposed road improvement. In such cases, the applicant for development proposal may voluntarily agree to pay the pro-rated share of said road improvements attributed to the subject development as indicated in said study. The county shall reserve the right to require a traffic study completed by the applicant by a traffic engineer;
(3)
In cases where a developer agrees to provide a proportionate share of the cost of funding the proposed road, and the county has not or cannot secure funding for the remaining share of the costs of improving the proposed road, either through the participation of other developers or through public funds, the board of commissioners is authorized to escrow the funds contributed by the developer as a proportionate share of the total costs of such proposed road improvements in an interest-bearing account to be expended at the discretion of the county. If the county does not encumber for the specific purpose said escrowed funds submitted by the particular land developer within six years of the date such funds are escrowed, the contributor shall be entitled to, and upon written request the county will reimburse to the land developer, the escrowed funds plus that portion of interest in such account attributed to the developer's escrowed funds;
(4)
In cases where the timing of the road improvement cannot be assured to coincide with the development, and the developer has agreed to provide a proportionate share of the cost of funding the proposed road, the development applicant and the county may agree for the developer to conduct all or a negotiated part of the grading activities necessary for the road improvement, in lieu of escrowed funds for improvement of the proposed road itself; or
(5)
Any other written arrangement mutually agreed to by the development applicant and the board of commissioners.
Sec. 4.02.12. - Minimum access and connectivity requirements.
(a)
Connection to planned road system. It is intended that frontage roads and other local roads in the I-75 overlay district, and connections from development to such frontage roads and local roads, will be planned and coordinated with the road system of the surrounding area and with the plans for future roads in the overlay district. Accordingly, a lot owner may be required, as part of the land development approval process, to connect to an existing or planned frontage road or other part of the public or private street or road access system.
(b)
Connection to state routes. All commercial driveways onto state routes in the I-75 overlay district are subject to the Georgia Department of Transportation Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control or any official revisions thereto. No development permit or land-disturbance permit shall be issued that involves a driveway or other access onto a state route unless a commercial driveway permit or access approval from the Georgia Department of Transportation has been submitted to the zoning administrator.
(c)
Inter-parcel access. Inter-parcel site access shall be provided to adjacent properties where the board of commissioners has determined that the land uses so connected are compatible. The following figure provides a basic guide for compatible uses, though the ultimate determination is up to the board of commissioners. Where inter-parcel access is required, property owners will be required to grant an access easement across the lot or development site to facilitate the movement of motor vehicles across the lot or development site.

  (d)
Right-of-ways and easements. Prior to development approval, an additional road right-of-way for a county road or private road or an access easement may be required to be dedicated. The location, type, and amount of right-of-way or easement to be dedicated may also be needed at intersections or at other locations fronting the property where turning lanes or road intersection realignments are required for traffic safety and the right-of-way is inadequate to accommodate the road, drainage, and utility, and other improvements are necessitated by the development or called for in the future road plan for the overlay district.
(e)
Separation of directions of travel. On any two-lane, two-way directional travel road, or other access way, whether public or private, the directions of travel may be separated if necessary to minimize grading requirements, subject to the county's approval.
(f)
Crossing of streams with road, bridge or driveway access. Where roads, bridges, and driveways must cross streams and tributaries, they shall cross such streams and tributaries at the least sensitive places and while providing the shortest feasible bridge.
Sec. 4.02.13. - Standards for pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure.
Land development or subdivision within the overlay district will be reviewed for conformity with the following standards and adherence to the following principles, which are articulated to ensure safe and convenient pedestrian access within and to/from the land development or subdivision:
(a)
Pedestrians are a part of everyday roadway environment, and attention must be paid to their presence in rural as well as urban areas.
(b)
As a general practice, sidewalks should not be constructed along any county road or state highway in the overlay district where future residential development density is expected to be lower than two dwelling units per acre or where industrial development is planned.
(c)
Sidewalks used for pedestrian access to schools, parks, and shopping areas, and placed along all streets in office, institutional and commercial areas, should be provided along both sides of the road. In residential areas, sidewalks are desirable on both sides of the street but need to be provided on at least one side of all local streets.
(d)
Sidewalks along streets with curbs and gutters should be separated from the curb by a planting strip of at least two feet along local residential streets and five feet along local collector and commercial streets. Sidewalks along streets without curbs and gutters should be separated by a drainage swale.
(e)
At street intersections with traffic signalization, crosswalks shall be provided including curb ramps. Crosswalks within the overlay shall be the highly visible "piano key" style with five-inch parallel band pairs two feet apart. All curb ramps in the overlay are required to meet applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
(f)
Land developers are required to provide pedestrian connections on private properties to sidewalks on public or private roads.
(g)
Bicycle facilities may be provided by the private developer via incorporation of bicycle paths and/or bicycle lanes internal to the development. Subject to the approval of the zoning administrator, a bicycle lane may be incorporated within the right-of-way of a public road abutting the proposed development. Bicycle paths may be provided within their own dedicated right-of-way.
(h)
When a bicycle lane, bicycle path, or multi-use trail crosses a road intersection or a railroad, then ramps and adequate warning and safety signing and or striping must be provided subject to the approval of the county engineer utilizing applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and county standards.
(i)
Bicycle lanes on county roads shall be a minimum of four feet in width. On rural roads without curbs and gutters, the shoulders of roads may be paved, designated, and maintained for bicycle travel.
(j)
Bicycle paths are separate paved trails not attached to the adjacent road. The minimum width for a bicycle path shall be ten feet. The county engineer may reduce this required width to eight feet in instances where he or she finds bicycle traffic and pedestrian use will be light and where the path presents a satisfactory and safe alignment vertically and horizontally. The county engineer may also authorize a reduction of the minimum width for short sections of the bicycle path where necessary to preserve trees, move the bicycle path alignment to avoid hazards, at narrow bridge crossings, or at other places as may be appropriate. When a bicycle path is incorporated into a multiuse trail, the multi-use trail should either be constructed to a width of 12 feet or provided with pullouts or passing areas in frequent places along the length of the multi-use trail to accommodate passing situations for different users traveling at different speeds.
(k)
Bicycle paths shall have a minimum two-foot wide graded shoulder area on at least one side of the bicycle path in addition to the width requirements mentioned above. Vertical clearance shall be eight feet minimum with ten feet desirable.
Sec. 4.02.14. - General site design requirements.
(a)
Buffer along Interstate 75.
(1)
Properties abutting the west right-of-way of Interstate 75 shall maintain a natural undisturbed buffer not less than 100 feet in width to serve as a visual and acoustical barrier to noise from the I-75 corridor. If 100 feet of undisturbed buffer is unavailable, 50 feet of planted buffer should be used to achieve opacity.
(2)
Properties abutting the east right-of-way of Interstate 75 shall maintain a landscaped area not less than 30 feet in width that allows view of the businesses located on the frontage road.
(b)
Buffers standards. Buffers shall contain a minimum of seventy-five percent of evergreen plant materials comprised of diverse array of plant species, and no plant species may account for more than 15 percent of the plant material for the particular categories of canopy shade tree, understory tree, shrub, or ground cover. One tree shall be planted for every 50 linear feet of buffer area. Turf grass shall not be considered as an appropriate buffer material.
(c)
Supplementing buffers. In those instances where the existing natural vegetation and topography are insufficient to achieve the desired level of screening as required by this section, a planted buffer shall be provided and shall consist of plant material of such growth characteristics as will provide a visual screen having a height of not less than six feet in two years and planted in a minimum of two rows with staggered spacing such that a continuous opaque screen is created within two years of planting.
(d)
Buffer maintenance. Required buffer strips shall be established and maintained in perpetuity by the owner(s) of the nonresidential land use. The required buffer strip shall not be disturbed by grading, property improvements, or construction activities except where necessary to prevent a nuisance, to remove diseased, misshapen, or dangerous and decayed timbers, or any similar county approved enhancement. Any contemplated disturbance shall first be brought to the attention of the Butts County community development department and formal approval of a permit secured prior to initiating activity within the required buffer areas.
(e)
Certificate of occupancy. Buffers shall be provided in accordance with the approved plan prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(f)
No parking. Buffers shall be prohibited from being used for temporary or permanent parking or loading.
(g)
Buffers between uses. Refer to the table below for the buffer requirements between different uses within the overlay.

Sec. 4.06.00. - Standards for mixed use (MU) district—P-M planned development.
Sec. 4.06.01. - Purpose.
(a)
P-M zoning districts are intended to:
(1)
Encourage the development of large tracts of land as planned neighborhoods or communities.
(2)
Encourage flexible and creative concepts in site planning.
(3)
Preserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging scenic and functional open areas within residential areas.
(4)
Create a more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of minimum requirements of other sections of this ordinance.
(5)
Provide for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets as well as lower development and housing costs.
(6)
Provide an environment of stable character which is compatible with surrounding residential areas.
(b)
Within the planned area, a variety of land uses may be permitted in an orderly relation to one another and to existing land uses. This may be accomplished through the application of sound comprehensive planning principles.
(c)
P-M districts are allowed only where public water and sewage is available.
Sec. 4.06.02. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within a P-M district.
The standards for the exercise of the zoning power, as well as data submitted with the development plan of the applicant for a planned development, must be thoroughly considered by the planning and zoning commission as well as the board of commissioners when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will ensure that rational comprehensive planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of Butts County.
Sec. 4.06.03. - Boundaries of P-M districts.
The official map (section 2.01.01 of this ordinance) shows the boundaries of all P-M districts within Butts County.
Sec. 4.06.04. - Permitted uses.
Permitted uses in the P-M districts shall be as shown in the approved development plan.
Sec. 4.06.05. - Plan review and approval procedures.
(a)
Pre-application conference. Prior to filing a formal application for a P-M, the applicant may confer with the zoning administrator in order to review the general character of the plan (on the basis of tentative land use sketch) and to obtain information on development standards and ordinances affecting the proposed project.
(b)
Submission of application for P-M approval.
(1)
The applicant must file a proposed development plan with the zoning administrator. This application must be supported by a development plan and a written summary of intent. The relationship between the proposed development and the surrounding area, both existing and proposed, must be shown. The following information must be presented with the development plan:
a.
A general location map.
b.
Existing topographic conditions, including contour intervals of no more than five feet based on field surveys or photogrammetric methods.
c.
The existing and proposed land uses and the approximate location of all buildings and structures.
d.
The approximate location of existing and proposed streets.
e.
The approximate location of all existing and proposed utilities, including a preliminary utility and drainage plan.
f.
The present zoning pattern in the area.
g.
A legal description of the subject property.
h.
The location and use of existing and proposed public, semipublic, and community facilities such as schools, parks, and open areas on the site. This includes areas proposed to be dedicated or reserved for community or public use.
i.
Elevations of representative building types; however, this is not required for single-family detached dwellings.
(2)
If a proposed development creates special problems or involves unusual circumstances, additional information may be required in order to properly evaluate the proposal. Such additional information includes, but is not limited to, the following:
a.
An off-street parking and loading plan.
b.
An economic feasibility report or market analysis.
c.
A traffic study of the area and a circulation plan within the proposed development as well as to and from existing streets.
(3)
The written summary of intent submitted with the development plan must include the following information:
a.
A statement of the present ownership of all land within the proposed development.
b.
An explanation of the character of the proposed development; this includes a summary of acres, numbers and types of dwelling units, and gross density by type of land use.
c.
A general statement of the proposed development schedule.
d.
Agreements, provisions, and covenants which govern the use, maintenance, and protection of the development and any common or open areas.
(c)
Review and approval of P-M application.
(1)
An application for approval of a P-M district is treated administratively as an application for an amendment to this ordinance (rezoning). This is because P-M districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well-designed P-M district. Upon approval of the P-M district, existing zoning must be changed to a P-M zone, which is an amendment to the ordinance. The amendment procedures contained in section 10.02.03 must be followed in granting the amendment to permit the P-M district, with the exception of the 30-day time limit on planning and zoning commission recommendations. Since review of the development plan is much more complex than the review for other rezoning applications in which simple development standards are specified, the time allowed for the planning and zoning commission to send the written record of comments received at the public hearing, along with its recommendations on the proposed, to the board of commissioners is 60 days.
(2)
The zoning administrator will turn over the application materials to the planning and zoning commission for its recommendations. The planning and zoning commission will thoroughly study the materials and make written recommendations to the board of commissioners, stating the reasons for its recommendations within 60 days after the public hearing.
(3)
The power to approve an amendment creating a P-M district rests with the board of commissioners. After conducting a public hearing and considering recommendations from the planning and zoning commission, the board of commissioners will then make an official decision on the proposed P-M district. The board of commissioners may approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the development plan.
(4)
If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official map will be changed to indicate the P-M district. If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant shall have ten days following the public meeting at which the plan is approved with modifications to withdraw the application. If the applicant does not provide the zoning administrator with written notice that the application is withdrawn within that period, the official zoning map will then be changed to reflect the rezoning of the property to a P-M zoning classification. The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be identified and permanently filed with the zoning administrator. Any development of the subject property must comply with the approved development plan.
(5)
The official map will then be changed. The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the zoning administrator.
(6)
No building permits will be issued by the zoning administrator until the development plan has been approved by the board of commissioners.
(d)
Issuance of building permits. The zoning administrator will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, final plat, and all other applicable regulations. (See chapter 10.)
(e)
Revision of development plan after approval of plan.
(1)
Minor modifications.
a.
The zoning administrator is authorized to approve minor changes in any previously approved development plan subject to the limitations in this subsection.
b.
Minor modifications to an approved development plan for a P-M district may include, but are not limited to, refinements to the location of permitted uses provided such changes do not materially vary from the overall development concepts or nature of the approved development when compared with the approved development plan.
c.
Minor modifications to an approved preliminary plan for a development within the P-M district may include, but are not limited to, minor shifting of the location of streets, public or private ways, utility easements, parks or other public open spaces, or other incidental features of the plan, provided that such changes meet all the following:
1.
Do not increase densities.
2.
Do not change the outside boundaries of the development tract.
3.
Do not affect the form of ownership, control or maintenance of common areas.
(2)
Major modification.
a.
Any modification of an approved P-M district development plan requested by an owner or developer that does not qualify as a minor modification shall be a major modification.
b.
Major modifications in an approved P-M district development plan or a development within the P-M district shall constitute a new application and shall require re-advertisement of public hearing dates and re-hearing by the board of commissioners. In such case, the zoning administrator shall require the applicant to pay an additional fee commensurate with a new application.
(f)
Initiation of rezoning back to original district. Construction of the planned development must begin within one year of the approval of the P-M district. If no construction has begun by then, or if the applicant fails to maintain the approved development schedule, approval of the development plan will lapse. At its discretion and for good cause, the board of commissioners may extend the period for beginning construction of any phase of the project for one additional year. If approval of the development plan lapses under this provision, the planning and zoning commission may initiate zoning amendment proceedings to restore the previous zoning to the subject property.
Sec. 4.06.06. - Development standards for P-M districts.
In addition to the development standards pertaining to subdivision plat approval, the following standards are required within P-M districts:
(a)
Development plan. An approved development plan must be carried out (see section 4.06.05).
(b)
Density controls. The maximum number of dwelling units per acre in residential areas of a planned development must not exceed 5.5 dwelling units per net acre of residential development within the P-M district. (Net residential acreage refers only to land devoted primarily to residential purposes, exclusive of other uses, such as common open space, streets, and lakes. Gross acreage of residential development refers to land devoted primarily to residential purposes as well as open spaces, including private lakes within the P-M district held under individual, common, or collective ownership for the use of residents of the residential development. Gross acreage for residential development does not include areas reserved or dedicated for street rights-of-way.)
(c)
Deviation from required densities.
(1)
The board of commissioners may allow higher net or gross residential densities, as well as a higher density of a particular residential use, as long as the applicant can show that such a higher density will not be detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood.
(2)
The board of commissioners will consider a deviation from the specified maximum density only upon a favorable recommendation from the planning and zoning commission.
(d)
Dimensional and bulk regulations. The location of all proposed buildings and structures must be shown on the approved development plan; minimum lot sizes, setback lines, lot coverages, and floor areas shown on the development plan must be adhered to. The proposed location and arrangement of structures must not be detrimental to existing or proposed adjacent dwellings or to the development of the neighborhood.
(e)
Perimeter requirements. The board of commissioners may impose additional setbacks to protect the privacy of adjoining uses.
(f)
Control of area after completion. After completion of a planned development, the use of land and the construction, modification, or alteration of any buildings or structures within the P-M district must conform to the approved development plan. If community needs are found to be changing in the future and a revision of the approved development plan is thought to be needed, procedures contained in paragraph (e) of section 4.06.05 must be followed.
(g)
Public water and sewage service required. All buildings within P-M districts must be served by public water and sewage lines. Where such lines do not already exist, the developer is responsible for installation of them.
(h)
Development standards shown in approved development plan. Other development standards shown in an approved development plan apply only to the development shown on the specific development plan. Such development standards must be maintained. (See section 4.06.05 for related details.)
(i)
Design standards for all P-M developments.
(1)
General. Condition of soil, groundwater level, drainage, and ground slope must not create hazards to the property or to the health or safety of residents. The site must not be exposed to objectionable smoke, noise, odors, or other adverse conditions; no part subject to flooding or erosion can be used for any purpose that would expose people or property to danger.
(2)
Soil and ground cover. Exposed ground surfaces throughout the development must be protected with a vegetative growth that prevents soil erosion, standing puddles, and dust. If this is not possible, such areas may be covered with a solid material such as stone or may be paved.
(3)
Site drainage. The ground surfaces throughout the development must be equipped to drain all surface water in a safe, efficient manner, either through grading or installation of drains.
(4)
Required buffer. A buffer is required along all lot lines of the development. This is in addition to common open space.
Sec. 4.07.00. - Standards for mixed use (MU) district—P-R planned development—Residential.
Sec. 4.07.01. - Purpose and intent.
P-R zoning districts are intended to achieve the following purposes, intentions and objectives:
(a)
Flexibility. Allow and encourage more unique, flexible, creative and imaginative arrangements in residential development than are permitted through conventional land use requirements for suburban residential subdivisions. That flexibility is intended to be promoted primarily (but not exclusively) through the application of conservation subdivision principles in land subdivision and development as articulated in this article. Through allowances for clustering of residential lots and other flexible, innovative development arrangements, smaller networks of utilities and streets are possible which can thereby lower development and housing costs.
(b)
Planned and coordinated development. Allow and encourage the development of tracts of land as single developments that are planned neighborhoods or communities, including civic and semi-public uses (e.g., schools, playgrounds, meeting halls, etc.) that help to make up a community; this objective is achieved through some flexibility in permitted uses and a minimum land area for rezoning to and development of this zoning district.
(c)
Preservation of green spaces. Preserve the natural amenities of the land through maintenance of conservation areas, open spaces, and green spaces within developments. Areas considered natural amenities include, but are not limited to, floodplains, wetlands, steep slopes, rolling hills, open fields, and active farmland. This objective is achieved through the application of minimum open space requirements for planned residential developments and conservation subdivision principles in land subdivision and development.
(d)
Density bonus as an inducement. Provide for slightly higher gross residential development densities as an inducement to develop in a manner consistent with the comprehensive plan and this article.
(e)
Adequate public facilities and development agreements. Ensure that residential development within this zoning district is adequately served by public facilities and services needed for the type of development at the time development impacts occur. To implement this objective, this article provides a mechanism for negotiating development agreements (and/or the applicant's agreement to conditions of rezoning) for future public facilities, or land for future facilities, where additional facilities, not otherwise available but needed to serve the development proposed, are provided by the developer.
(f)
Direct the location of residential development in accordance with the comprehensive plan. Implement the residential growth goals, strategies, and recommendations of the Butts County comprehensive plan. It is specifically the intent of this article to prevent this zoning district from being used or applied in areas outside those properties designated as "Tier 1, Existing Urban or Suburban" and "Tier 2, 2007-2015 Development Areas" as shown on the map titled "Growth Phasing Program" in the adopted Butts County comprehensive plan.
(g)
Establish parameters for maintaining rural character. Even though the P-R zoning district is intended to allow for residential development at suburban and urban densities in appropriate locations, it is also a major goal of the county's comprehensive plan to preserve and retain rural character, even in these areas. Therefore, this ordinance establishes guidelines and recommendations for the preservation and retention of rural character. This objective is achieved by requiring the adherence of development proposals with principles of conservation subdivision design and land development and guidelines for maintaining rural character.
(h)
Coordinated and compatible design of buildings. Ensure that the designs of building forms are interrelated and architecturally harmonious and maintain compatibility with surrounding land uses and, where evident, rural character. This objective is achieved through the submission and review of architectural elevations for typical buildings in the planned residential development, the submission and review of a detailed site plan at the time of rezoning, and through the application of guidelines as specified in this article.
(i)
Encourage broader mixes of housing types. In the areas designated as "Tier 1, Existing Urban or Suburban" and "Tier 2, 2007-2015 Development Areas" as shown on the map titled "Growth Phasing Program" in the adopted Butts County comprehensive plan, encourage a broader mix of residential housing types, including detached and attached dwellings, than would normally be constructed in conventional residential subdivisions.
(j)
Specify additional application requirements. Establish application requirements that are more rigorous than rezoning applications and special use applications but no more onerous than is necessary to enable thorough analyses of the development proposal's consistency with the objectives and requirements of this article.
Sec. 4.07.02. - Definitions.
For purposes of this article, the following terms are defined.

The instrument for permanent protection shall include clear restrictions on the use of the open space, consistent with the requirements of this article, as well as any further restrictions the applicant chooses to place on the use of the open space.
(h)
Private restrictions. P-R zoning districts that have proposed commonly-owned facilities and space shall have private restrictions and covenants established which shall be subject to the approval of the county attorney and zoning administrator. The applicant for P-R rezoning involving commonly-owned facilities and space shall submit, along with the development plan application, a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions, articles of incorporation and by-laws for the property owners or homeowners' association. The declaration shall confer membership to the owner of property subject to assessment by the association, provide for voting rights in the association with suggestions for the division of power between the developer and the property owners, and provide for maintenance assessments, among other things.
(i)
Architectural elevations. Applications shall include perspective front, side and rear elevation drawings of representative building types, including details for typical detached single-family dwellings and their typical accessory buildings. These drawings shall indicate general architectural characteristics. If the P-R rezoning is approved, architectural elevations submitted as part of the application shall be considered binding unless specifically noted otherwise in the approval.
(j)
Facility impact analysis. The applicant shall submit an analysis of the public's ability to serve the proposed development with sheriff, police, fire protection, schools, water, sewer, roads, recreation facilities, solid waste collection and disposal, libraries, and other public facilities and services. The subdivider or land developer shall construct such oversized improvements and utilities that the county determines are necessary, provided that the subdivider or land developer shall not be obligated for the additional cost of improvements and utilities that are not uniquely required for that development, and provided the subdivider agrees to a proposal by the county to share in the cost arrangements for over-sizing improvements and utilities. A formula may be developed by the county to provide for a sharing of the cost of other improvements needed to serve the subdivision or land development when certain of the improvements are necessary to serve future subdivisions or developments in the vicinity.
(k)
Development agreement. Where the fiscal impact analysis submitted with the application notes possible future deficiencies in county facilities or services if the planned residential development is approved and constructed, or where desirable for other reasons, the applicant shall submit a draft "development agreement," specifying, among other components, provisions regarding developer-funding infrastructure to mitigate the facility deficiencies identified in the fiscal impact analysis. The zoning administrator, and other county staff as appropriate, will participate in the process of drafting the specific provisions of the development agreement with the applicant. It is intended that the draft development agreement will be generally accepted by appropriate county staff and be a part of the application prior to determining the application complete and processing the P-R rezoning application for public hearings. That intent shall not preclude changes and refinement of the development agreement during the public hearing process, as may be necessary to respond to recommendations of the planning commission, additional suggestions by staff, or to meet the approval of the Butts County board of commissioners.
(l)
Consistency with watershed water supply protection districts. Where a development is proposed in a watershed water supply district, excepting the Ocmulgee River Watershed District, the requirements of those districts shall be applicable to the proposed P-R development, unless the applicant submits a plan and studies, to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator, demonstrating that the impact of the development on water quality will be less than that which would have occurred under the standard requirements of the watershed water supply district. Additional approval processes may be necessary.
Sec. 4.07.06. - Procedures.
(a)
Pre-application conference. Prior to filing an application for a P-R zoning district, the applicant may confer with the zoning administrator in order to review the general character and certain specific elements of the proposal. Upon learning of a pending application for P-R rezoning, or at the most expedient time before accepting a P-R rezoning application as complete, the zoning administrator may schedule a pre-application conference with the applicant, who should provide and present at the pre-application conference all preliminary materials such as, but not limited to, a basic sketch plan of the development, general intentions for land uses, boundary surveys of the site to be rezoned, and notes regarding any prior discussions about utility, facility, service, and other infrastructure availability and/or deficiencies.
The zoning administrator may request that other appropriate staff attend the pre-application conference, which may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: Butts County public works; Butts County administration; Butts County board of education; and the Butts County water and sewer authority. Fire department personnel also should be in attendance to conduct a review for public safety of the road plan. At the pre-application conference, the applicant will receive general instruction and suggestions on filing the complete rezoning application, including suggested components of a "development agreement" as defined by this article. Any information or suggestions provided by county or agency officials shall not be binding or interpreted as providing approval or commitment of Butts County or the agencies represented with regard to the development proposal.
(b)
Recommendation and approval authority. All applications for P-R rezoning shall be subject to the public hearing and notice requirements specified in chapter 10. All applications for P-R rezoning shall be processed and considered by the planning commission and decided upon by the board of commissioners the same as any other applications for rezoning.
(c)
Revisions. Amendments to approved P-R zoning districts and development plans shall be permitted but governed by the procedures and provisions for changing the official zoning map.
(d)
Preliminary plat. If the applicant does not simultaneously seek and receive approval of the preliminary plat at the time of P-R rezoning approval, then the applicant shall be required to submit a preliminary plat application.
(e)
Development permit. Upon approval of a P-R rezoning application by the board of commissioners, and preliminary plat approval by the planning commission, the land developer may apply for development permit approval. Excavation, grading or land disturbance applications shall only be approved for development that has been approved in accordance with the provisions of this article.
(f)
Final plat. The applicant shall submit a final plat for approval in accordance with chapter 10 of this UDO.
(g)
Building permits and certificates of occupancy. No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a building, structure, or use that has not been approved in accordance with the provisions of this article. The zoning administrator shall authorize the issuance of building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved P-R rezoning development plan if they are in substantial conformity with the approved development plan, after improvements are installed in accordance with applicable improvement requirements, and if found to be in conformance with all other applicable regulations. The zoning administrator shall authorize the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any completed building structure or use located in the area covered by the P-R zoning district if it conforms to the requirements of the approved planned residential development and all other applicable regulations. After completion of a development in the P-R zoning district, the use of land and construction, modification or alteration of any buildings, structures or uses within the area covered by said development shall be regulated by the approved development plan for the P-R zoning district.
Sec. 4.07.07. - Criteria for approval.
In addition to the standards applicable to other zoning decisions, the county shall consider the following criteria in reviewing an application for a P-R zoning district:
(a)
Comprehensive plan. Whether the application is consistent with the comprehensive plan of the county.
(b)
Architectural compatibility. The extent to which the proposed site development features and architectural features of buildings within the proposed development are harmonious, compatible with adjacent and nearby existing development, and consistent with the guidelines for preserving rural character, if made applicable by this article.
(c)
Facility adequacy. Development within this zoning district is adequately served by public facilities and services needed for the type of development at the time development impacts occur. If such facilities and services are inadequate, as shown in the fiscal impact analysis submitted with the application or as determined independently by the county, a development agreement that mitigates facility or infrastructure deficiencies by the developer is considered adequate and is approved by the board of commissioners.
(d)
Open space adequacy. The adequacy of open spaces that are provided. Conformance with the open space requirements of this article is required. In addition, approval or denial of a P-R rezoning application and development plan shall be based on the extent to which the application and plan meet the following open space planning criteria:
(1)
Primary conservation areas are required to be included within the protected open space, unless the applicant demonstrates that this provision would constitute an unusual hardship and be counter to the purposes of this article.
(2)
A sufficient amount of secondary conservation areas are protected as permanent open space, as opposed to being devoted to lots and other uses.
(3)
The configuration of the open space tract is contiguous and undivided, or open space is provided in relatively undivided tracts that cannot reasonably be reconfigured into one contiguous, undivided tract.
(e)
Rural cluster siting criteria. Residential development shall be clustered or sited so as to minimize disruption of rural character. In such areas, the following additional criteria shall be adhered to:
(1)
A rural cluster subdivision may contain one or more residential clusters grouped into compact neighborhoods.
(2)
To the maximum practicable extent, existing historic rural features shall be preserved as part of the cluster development. These features include, but are not limited to, rock walls, fences, functional and structurally safe farm buildings, and landscape features.
(3)
Buildings shall be clustered or sited in the most accessible, least visually prominent, and most geologically stable portion or portions of the site.
(4)
Rural clusters shall be limited to locations that minimize the visual impact from adjacent lands and view corridors. Placing buildings so that vegetation, rock outcroppings, depressions in topography, or other natural features will screen them where they exist shall minimize the prominence of construction. In wooded or forested areas, the planning commission may require the scattering of buildings so as to save trees and minimize visual impacts.
(5)
Cluster lots shall be sited to minimize conflicts between housing and adjacent agriculturally-zoned property.
(6)
Cluster lots should border on open space on at least one side and have access to any core open spaces in the rural cluster.
(f)
Soil suitability for septic tanks and drain fields. When the P-R zoning district will not be served by public sanitary sewer or a community sewerage system, it is generally the intent that each lot has at least one-half acre of suitable soil for a septic tank drain field and that each lot has sufficient area for a replacement drain field, as may be more specifically determined by the Butts County health department depending on the specific nature of the development proposal, such as the number of bedrooms in dwellings, the types of amenities provided, and any other variables that would affect the sizing of septic tanks and placement of drain fields. Failure of the development proposal to meet this criterion may be cause to disapprove the P-R rezoning.
(g)
Access, safety, and convenience of school children. The development plan adequately considers the needs of school-age students with respect to access to bus stops within, adjacent to, or nearby the P-R development. Such considerations include safe and adequate sidewalks or paths from residential areas to places where the county schools' buses will stop to pick up and drop off students, lighting of the school bus stops during hours of darkness, and shelter or other safety and convenience considerations. Failure of the development proposal to meet this criterion may be cause to disapprove the PR rezoning.
(h)
Reducing wild land fire hazards. The development proposal should incorporate design considerations and/or regulations that mitigate structure ignition hazards consistent with recommendations of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1144, "Standard for Reducing Structure Ignition Hazards from Wildland Fire," 2008 or future edition, or similar acceptable publication or best practices. Failure of the development proposal to meet this criterion may be cause to disapprove the P-R rezoning.
Sec. 4.07.08. - Guidelines for preserving rural character.
(a)
Location of dwellings and other buildings. Siting dwellings and other buildings is one of the most important considerations, and therefore, this aspect receives particular attention. Areas of the open countryside are less able to absorb development without significant impact upon existing scenic and rural amenities.
Consistent: Dwelling is located close to the road (or at the edge of fields) to allow continued use of land for crops and pasture. Future development should respect the established pattern of crop lands, pasture and the rural, open space character of the area. Woodlands are preserved.
Above left (consistent): Building is sited within or adjacent to existing vegetation that partially screens the building.
Above right (inconsistent): Building is sited near top of ridge or hill and is too visible, and non-native landscaping has been introduced.
Below (inconsistent): New house is sited in a visually prominent location in the center of the site with no regard for existing conditions.
Consistent: New houses sited as not to compete with older structures in established settlement pattern.
Propose a site and design structure that will minimize the visual impact of buildings and site on the natural landscape. In cases where there are practical reasons why a visible location must be selected, it will need to be justified and an explanation given as to why sites that are less visible cannot be utilized. In addition, approval of building locations on visually prominent sites requires mitigation of visual impacts through buffering or screening, additional (or different) architectural treatments, or other appropriate measures.
Below (consistent): The lots are clustered near existing dwelling(s), buildings are set back from open fields adjacent to road, and existing hedge rows and tree lines are maintained.
(b)
Excavation and grading. Dwelling and building sites should be chosen that require the least amount of excavation and grading (e.g., cut and fill). Excessive excavation unnecessarily disturbs the natural contours of the land and can result in negative visual impacts and unnatural-looking sites.
Inconsistent: Grading does not respect existing contours and does not blend into the landform. Avoid severe cutting, filling, padding, or terracing for home or building sites.
Projects involving more than one use or phase should be phased into workable units in a way that minimizes the amount of soil disturbance at any given point in time. When grading must occur, it should blend with the natural landform as much as possible. Grading to form level pads and building sites is strongly discouraged, and when required, such grading should be minimized.
(c)
Rural road design. Roads shall meet the standards established in section 6.01.06 of this ordinance. Access from a public road through a site should follow or have due regard for the contours of the site.
One-way streets shall be permitted and encouraged where appropriate for the terrain and where public safety would not be jeopardized. For instance, a two-way road may have the directions of flow split into one-way pairs that differ in elevation, circumnavigate difficult terrain, or avoid tree clearance.
(d)
Access from dwellings and building sites onto public roads. Any new driveway or public or private road entrance should be carefully located considering the view from the public road.
For all rural cross-section streets, public or private, ditches are essential for proper drainage and shall be designed and provided to handle total volume and velocity of water for the particular road location. The following standards for ditches shall be followed:
(1)
Swales must be able to be designed to:
a.
Convey a 25-year storm event.
b.
Incorporate freeboard equivalent to 20 percent of the design depth with a one-foot minimum measured to the road shoulder.
c.
Be constructed using the following types of cross-sections:
1.
Parabolic;
2.
Trapezoidal with a minimum two-foot bottom;
3.
No "V" shaped cross-section.
d.
Limit velocities to or below the maximum contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, latest edition, for proposed channel liner.
e.
Have side slopes of 3H:1V, horizontal to vertical, or flatter and meet the following additional standards:
1.
Slopes must be able to be maintained by the property owner with standard mechanized equipment.
2.
Channel liners:
i.
Grassing if velocity is less than 2.0 f.p.s. Must be maintained until 100 percent of the development site has 70 percent permanent grassing established.
ii.
Sod if velocity is less than 5.0 f.p.s. Sod is recommended for all vegetated channel lining.
iii.
Rip rap is required if velocity is between 5.0 and 10.0 f.p.s. Design must be consistent with the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, latest edition.
iv.
Concrete is not allowed for side ditches.
v.
Methods to reduce velocity should be used.
vi.
For a velocity over 10.0 f.p.s., side ditches are not allowed.
(2)
Driveway culvert designs shall be included as part of the construction drawings. The following standards shall apply:
a.
Culverts must be designed for a 25-year storm event.
b.
The minimum pipe size shall be 15 inches in diameter.
c.
Culverts must have end treatments:
1.
Flared end sections are preferred.
2.
Precast winged headwalls shall not be allowed.
3.
Alternative end treatments must be approved by the Butts County public works director or designee.
d.
Culverts must have storm drain outlet protection compliant with the standards established in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, latest edition.
e.
A minimum of one and one-half feet of cover under the driveway shall be provided.
f.
Culverts shall be designed to minimize exit velocities.
(3)
Cross drains must be designed to:
a.
Accommodate a 100-year storm event.
b.
Have a minimum pipe size no less than 18 inches in diameter.
c.
Have an end treatment meeting the following specifications:
1.
Flared end sections are preferred.
2.
Precast winged headwalls are allowed under site-specific conditions as determined by the county engineer or designee.
d.
Include storm drain outlet protection compliant with the standards established in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, latest edition.
e.
Provide a minimum of one and one-half feet of cover under the driveway.
f.
Minimize exit velocities.
g.
Allow reviewer to verify the impact of a 100-year storm event with the inclusion of the following standards:
1.
Headwater/pipe diameter, HW/d, shall be less than 2d.
2.
A minimum freeboard of one foot as measured from the road shoulder elevation shall be maintained.
(e)
Lighting. In the interest of preserving the rural atmosphere of the night sky in rural areas, street lighting along streets in new subdivisions or land developments is discouraged. If desired by a developer, streetlights must meet the approval of the zoning administrator for rural compatibility.
(f)
Roof materials.
Consistent: Standing seam metal roof preferred; corrugated sheet metal acceptable on farm outbuildings; tar paper and asphalt shingles acceptable; cedar or other wood shake shingles preferred over tar paper and asphalt shingles.
(g)
Architecture and exterior building materials. Architecture and building types should be compatible with existing buildings in the area (see illustration, below), including stone chimneys, front (shed) porches, steep gabled roofs, and wood siding. If a dwelling or building is to be composed of building materials that are incompatible with the established building materials and architectural features, it can significantly change the character of the rural setting.
In such instances where building materials that are incompatible or not consistent with the provisions of the design and character of the district must be used, the dwelling or building should not face or be located within 50 feet of the public road right-of-way.
Consistent: Steep or moderately steep gabled roof pitches; roof materials are asphalt composition shingle, wood shake, or standing seam metal; front porch is provided; base exterior is stone and siding is wood (hardi plank); chimney is provided; structural (timber) elements exposed at front porch entrance; house is sited below ridgeline; garage also has steep gabled roof and does not dominate view.
The use of natural materials for engineered structures is also encouraged, where appropriate. For instance, wood, stone, or dyed/textured concrete should be used for new guardrails, curbing, culverts and walls.
(h)
Garages and accessory buildings and structures. Garages (i.e., freestanding accessory buildings and structures for storage of vehicles) should complement the architectural style of the principal dwelling or building. They should not be visually prominent when viewed from the public road. Carport structures if composed of pre-fabricated metal shall not be located in a visible location in the front yard of a dwelling or building, or if they must be located in a visible area, they must be screened with native vegetation. Oversized accessory buildings for recreational vehicles, boats, and storage cannot be sited within front yards, and if provided, they shall be located as far to the rear of the lot as possible.
(i)
Landscaping. Native species should be preserved, where possible, and when landscaping is added, only native (indigenous to the region or area) species of trees, shrubs, vines, and other vegetation should be used. When new landscaping is introduced, trees and shrubs should be planted in groups and irregular patterns, not in rows.
Home sites should have carefully defined construction limits (building envelopes). Native vegetation must be left undisturbed outside building envelopes and areas for driveways, or where vegetation must be removed, it shall be replaced with native species. The introduction of new, sodded yards is discouraged in front yards, and a more natural appearance of native vegetation is sought.
Use plant materials that blend with the environment. Landscape schemes that are rough, natural, and/or subdued in character are encouraged. Extensive areas of exotic plants and sod are discouraged where they would be visible from the public right-of-way.
(j)
Fences and walls. If fences are to be provided in the front yard of a dwelling or building, they must be composed of wood materials. Examples of acceptable wood materials for fences in front yards are shown below.
Sec. 4.08.00. - Standards for R-5 manufactured housing communities.
Sec. 4.08.01. - General provisions.
(a)
R-5 zoning districts are intended to provide areas where stable communities for affordable housing can be located and efficiently developed in a manner compatible with surrounding residential areas while preserving the natural amenities of the land.
(b)
R-5 districts are allowed only where public water and sewer are available. All dwellings must be served by public water and sewage and sewage lines. Where such lines do not already exist, the developer is responsible for installation of them.
Sec. 4.08.02. - Permitted uses.
The following are permitted as principal uses in R-5 districts:

(3)
No vehicles or equipment may be stored on the lot.
(4)
A buffer must be maintained along the side and rear property lines.
Sec. 4.08.03. - Plan review and approval procedures.
(a)
Pre-application conference. Prior to filing a formal application for an R-5 district, the applicant may confer with the zoning administrator in order to review the general character of the plan (on the basis of tentative land use sketch, if available) and to obtain information on development standards and ordinances affecting the proposed project.
(b)
Submission of application for R-5 district approval.
(1)
The applicant must file a proposed development plan with the zoning administrator. This application must be supported by a development plan and a written summary of intent. The relationship between the proposed development and the surrounding area, both existing and proposed, must be shown. The following information must be presented with the development plan:
a.
A general location map.
b.
Existing topographic conditions, including contour intervals of no more than five feet based on field surveys or photogrammetric methods.

The approximate location of existing and proposed streets.
e.
The approximate location of all existing and proposed utilities, including a preliminary utility and drainage plan.
f.
The present zoning pattern in the area.
g.
A legal description of the subject property.
h.
The location and use of existing and proposed public, semipublic, and community facilities such as schools, parks, and open areas on the site. This includes areas proposed to be dedicated or reserved for community or public use.
(2)
If a proposed development creates special problems or involves unusual circumstances, additional information may be required in order to evaluate the proposal. Such additional information includes, but is not limited to, the following:
a.
An off-street parking and loading plan.
b.
An economic feasibility report or market analysis.
c.
A traffic study of the area and a circulation plan within the proposed development as well as to and from existing streets adjacent to the site.
(3)
The written summary of intent submitted with the development plan must include the following information:
a.
A statement of the present ownership of all land within the proposed development.
b.
An explanation of the character of the proposed development. This includes a summary of acres, number and types of dwelling units.
c.
A general statement of the proposed development schedule.
d.
Agreements, provisions, and covenants which govern the use, maintenance, and protection of the development and any common or open areas.
(c)
Review and approval of R-5 district application.
(1)
An application for approval of an R-5 district requires rezoning and shall be processed in the same manner provided by this ordinance for rezoning applications.
(2)
The zoning administrator will turn over the application materials to the planning and zoning commission for its recommendations.
(3)
The power to approve an amendment creating an R-5 district rests with the board of commissioners. After conducting the public hearing and considering recommendations from the planning and zoning commission, the board of commissioners will then make an official decision on the proposed R-5 district. The board of commissioners may approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the development plan.
(4)
If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official map will be changed to indicate the R-5 district. If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant shall have ten days following the public meeting at which the plan is approved with modifications to withdraw the application. If the applicant does not provide the zoning administrator with written notice that the application is withdrawn within that period, the official zoning map will then be changed to reflect the rezoning of the property to an R-5 zoning classification. The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be identified and permanently filed with the zoning administrator. Any development of the subject property must comply with the approved development plan.
(d)
Issuance of building permits. The zoning administrator will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations.
(e)
Revision of development plan after approval of plan.
(1)
Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval by the planning and zoning commission; such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan.
(2)
Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the board of commissioners after receipt of recommendations from the planning and zoning commission and shall be subject to the same procedures as a rezoning application.
(f)
Initiation of rezoning back to original district. Construction of the planned development must begin within one year of the approval of the R-5 district. If no construction has begun by then, or if the applicant fails to maintain the approved development schedule, approval of the development plan will lapse. At its discretion, the board of commissioners may extend the period for beginning construction of any phase of the project for one additional year. If approval of the development plan lapses under this provision, the planning and zoning commission may initiate zoning amendment proceedings to restore the previous zoning to the subject property.
Sec. 4.08.04. - Development standards
for R-5 districts.
In addition to the development standards contained in section 4.01.02 of this ordinance, the following standards are required within R-5 districts:
(a)

Sec. 4.09.05. - Buffer and open space requirements.
(a)
The intent of these requirements shall be to enhance the visual and aesthetic appearance of the county. The purpose of these buffer and open space requirements is to:
(1)
Provide space definition and landscape continuity within the built environment;
(2)
Provide appropriate screening and relief from traffic, noise, heat, glare, odor, and the spread of dust and debris;
(3)
Reduce the impact of development on the drainage system and reduce flooding;
(4)
Provide for a sense of privacy;
(5)
Provide for reduction or elimination of incompatibility;
(6)
Reduce the visual impact of unsightly aspects of adjacent development;
(7)
Provide for the separation of spaces; and
(8)
Provide for passive recreational areas and pedestrian or multi-use greenways and greenbelts.
(b)
Location, measurement, and design of buffers.
(1)
Buffers shall be located on private property on the outer perimeter of a lot, parcel, or tract of land extending to the lot, parcel, or tract boundary line and between the property line and any fence or wall, whether required or voluntary. Buffers shall not occupy any portion of an existing, dedicated, or reserved public or private street, or right-of-way.

Where such buffers are required, natural existing vegetation and trees shall be preserved when possible and may be substituted for any additional plantings as required here in this section.
(3)
Buffers required for single-family residential subdivision developments shall remain undisturbed where possible with the exception that utility crossings and access drives may be allowed. Said buffers are intended to protect existing agricultural uses from encroachment by new residential development, preserve open space, protect the natural environment, create greenways, greenbelts and opportunities for multiuse trails, and promote connectivity between such developments throughout the county.
(4)
Buffers shall be designed to avoid or minimize plantings within drainage, utility, or other easements.
(5)
Buffers shall be designed taking into consideration the site's soils conditions, topography, and natural resources. Native vegetation shall be used for landscaping and buffering unless the applicant demonstrates that the use of non-native, drought-resistant plants would best serve the site.
(6)
Buffers on multi-family residential, office, institutional, commercial, or industrial properties shall be established and maintained by the owner of the proposed development site. Buffers on single-family residential properties shall be maintained by the property owner.
(7)
Required building setbacks may be located in the buffer; however, where the buffer is greater than the setback, these buffer restrictions shall apply.
(c)
Buffer area standards.
