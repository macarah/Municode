Section 2309. - Criteria to consider for variances.
The Governing Body is hereby empowered to authorize upon application in specific cases such variance from the dimensional requirements of zoning regulations (any provisions requiring a number to be achieved, such as height in feet, setback, lot area, lot width, parking and loading requirements, etc.) as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The existence of a non-conforming use of neighboring land, buildings or structures in the same zoning district or of permitted or non-conforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance. A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship, after appropriate application in accordance with Section 2305 of this ordinance, upon specific findings that all of the following conditions exist. The absence of any one (1) of the conditions shall be grounds for denial of the application for variance.
1.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same district; and
2.
A literal interpretation of the provisions of these zoning regulations would create an unnecessary hardship and would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners within the district in which the property is located; and
3.
Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located; and
4.
Relief, if granted, will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or general welfare in such a manner as will interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonably affect their value; and
5.
The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant; and
6.
The variance request is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building, or structure; and
7.
The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, building or structures which are not permitted by right in the district involved.
8.
A variance shall not be granted in cases where the requested relief to the property owner can be remedied by a change to a zoning district which otherwise would not require a variance.
Section 2310. - Special use permits.
Special Use Permits may be authorized, as prescribed herein and as expressly permitted as a Special Use within a particular Zoning District, by the Mayor and Council after notice as provided herein and holding a Public Hearing in accordance with the policies and procedures outlined in Article XXIII.

The Governing Body is empowered to hear an appeal made by any person, firm, or corporation, or by any officer, department, board, or bureau affected by any decisions of the Planning Commission, if established, or Zoning Administrator based on the zoning ordinance.
This section shall not be construed as permitting an appeal of the Governing Body's denial (including when the Governing Body is acting as the Zoning Administrator) of a rezoning request, variance, special use permit, administrative interpretation, or conditional use, the appropriate remedy of which would be suit in county Superior Court following the certiorari appeal procedure as to discretionary appeals to the Superior Court.
Any claim or challenge to the provisions of the zoning regulations of Alto, the Governing Body's denial of a rezoning request, special use permit, conditional use, an administrative interpretation, an amendment to the official zoning map, or variances, or any combination thereof, which is based upon a constitutional basis, including but not limited to due process claims and equal protection claims, must be raised before the Governing Body, in order not to be deemed waived by the claimant. In this manner, the Governing Body shall have a full and complete opportunity to review and correct such claims.
Such appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) days, or as provided by the rules of this ordinance, by filing with the Zoning Administrator notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. All papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken shall forthwith be transmitted to the Governing Body.
All decisions of the Governing Body a/k/a The Town Council shall be the final decision by the Town of Alto.

Section 2312. - Conditional approval permitted.
In exercising the powers to grant variances, zoning map amendments, special use permits and conditional use approvals, the Zoning Administrator and Planning Commission, if established, may recommend, and the Governing Body may attach any conditions to its approval which it finds necessary to render the proposed zoning district, conditional use, special use permit or variance compatible with adjacent and nearby properties and land uses. Applications to alter or modify any such conditions shall be considered only after compliance with procedures and notice requirements as established in this ordinance, for the particular type of application.
Section 2313. - Public notice and public hearing required.
This section shall apply only to adoption of a new zoning ordinance, applications for amendments to the text of the zoning regulations, conditional use permits, special use permits, and amendments to the official zoning map.

The public hearing before the Governing Body shall not take place until said sign(s) have been posted for at least fifteen (15) days but not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of the public hearing before the Governing Body. Posting of sign(s) shall not be required for appeals of administrative interpretation, since an appeal only applies to interpretation of zoning regulations which apply to all similarly situated properties.
The Planning Commission, if established, shall not be required to hold a public hearing on any matter, although at its direction it may hold a public hearing during the regular meeting at which said application is to be considered.
Public hearings may be delayed, rescheduled or continued at another time and date, provided announcement is given at the time and place of the initially scheduled and advertised public hearing, and provided such date, time, and location of the public hearing to be delayed, rescheduled or continued is announced. In cases where the Planning Commission has exercised its option to table an application the advertised public hearing before the Governing Body shall nevertheless be held at the time and date the hearing was advertised.
Section 2314. - Written notice to adjoining property owners.
Upon receipt of completed applications for amendment to the official zoning map, the Zoning Administrator may provide written notice of the application, including all information for published notices specified in Section 2312 of this Ordinance, by certified mail at least fifteen (15) days but not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of public hearing before the Governing Body, to all property owners with land adjoining the subject property, including those across public right-of-ways. Said written notices may be mailed to the address of the current property owner of adjoining lands as indicated on the current tax rolls of the Town of Alto. Copies of said written notice and postage receipts in the official zoning application file may be considered sufficient evidence that the Town has satisfied this notification. The failure to receive the written notice by a property owner shall not be considered a violation of due process notification requirements.
The Zoning Administrator may, at his discretion, provide written notices to property owners of adjoining property which is the subject of a conditional use, special use permit or a variance application, where in the Zoning Administrator's opinion adjoining property owners may be affected by the such requests. Written notices to adjoining property owners in such applications shall not be considered a mandated due process requirement.

Said recommendation shall include adequate justification, considered within the context of the appropriate criteria as specified by this ordinance. The recommendation of the Zoning Administrator shall have an advisory effect only and shall not be binding on the Governing Body. Copies of the Zoning Administrator's recommendations shall be made available to the application and other interested parties upon completion and distribution to the Planning Commission and Governing Body. If the Governing Body or the Mayor serves as the Zoning Administrator, no written recommendation need be made.

Further, to the extent that this Ordinance allows binding actions by the Planning Commission without approval of the Governing Body, the Governing Body shall perform such actions if the Planning Commission is not established. If the Planning Commission is established, the provisions of this section shall be followed.
Prior to the meeting or public hearing held by the Governing Body, the Planning Commission shall hold a meeting to consider any zoning ordinance and all applications for amendment to the text of the zoning regulations, amendments to the official zoning map, special use permits, conditional use applications and variances.
After completing its studies of the particular petition, the Planning Commission shall submit a recommended action in writing to the Governing Body. The Planning Commission may submit any additional report if it deems appropriate. The recommendations of the Planning Commission shall have an advisory effect only and shall not be binding on the Governing Body. Copies of the Planning Commission's recommendation and reports shall be made available to the applicant and other interested parties upon completion and distribution to the Governing Body and at the meeting or public hearing before the Governing Body.
The Planning Commission, if established, shall have thirty (30) days within which to submit its recommendations. The Governing Body shall hold the advertised public hearing but shall not take action on any of said applications, until it has received the recommendation of the Planning Commission, if established, within the specified time period. If the Planning Commission, if established, fails to submit a recommendation within the thirty (30) day period, it shall be deemed to have approved the proposed application.
Section 2317. - Conduct of public hearings.

Said petitioner or interested parties may respond upon recognition. Additional questions for the general public may not be asked once the public hearing has been closed. Once the public hearing is closed and a vote or other action is being considered, unrecognized responses from the petitioner or other participant shall be ruled out of order by the presiding officer.
Section 2318. - Action by the governing body.
After the public hearing has been completed, the Governing Body may take action to approve or deny the request, refer the application back to the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission for further study, or the Governing Body may table or defer action until a later meeting.
