Adequate sanitation and other required health facilities are or will be made available in or adjacent to the event area and the applicant has agreed to clean the right-of-way or public property of rubbish and debris, returning it to its pre-event condition within 24 hours of the conclusion of the event, with the understanding that failure to do so will result in the city conducting the clean-up and charging the applicant with any and all costs associated with the clean-up.
