Sec. 125-7. - Conduct of hearings.
The following policies and procedures shall govern the conduct of public hearings under this chapter:
(1)
The chairperson of the planning commission or his delegate on the commission shall open any hearing with an explanation of the purpose of the hearing and a description of the general rules for the conduct of the hearing. The chairperson or his delegate may describe the authority and role of the planning commission in any zoning decision. An individual requesting to be heard on a matter germane to the purpose of the hearing must be recognized by the chairperson or his delegate before addressing the planning commission. The chairperson or his delegate shall chair the hearing and shall determine germaneness of any proposed comment or presentation to the planning commission in the hearing and is authorized to rule any individual or a portion of any presentation out of order if not germane to the published purpose of the hearing. Any person requesting to address the planning commission, upon being recognized by the chairperson or his delegate, shall state his name and residence address before proceeding with any comment, remarks or presentation. Any person addressing the planning commission shall respond to questions of the chairperson or any member of the commission. The chairperson or his delegate may pre-determine the length of any hearing allotting equal time to proponents and opponents of any proposed zoning amendment to the extent that there are both proponents and opponents who desire to be heard. The chairperson or his delegate shall only be required to offer equal time to both proponents and opponents of any proposed zoning amendment and the fact that equal time is not, in fact, utilized by either position shall not invalidate any proceedings or action taken on the proposed amendment. The chairperson, however, shall allow a minimum time period to be no less than ten minutes per side for the presentation of data, evidence and opinion.
(2)
The chairperson or his delegate shall determine whether any application for a zoning amendment is properly filed and the type of zoning decision for which the proposed amendment calls. The chairperson or his delegate shall confirm the giving of proper public notice of the hearing on the proposed zoning amendment in accordance with this chapter.
(3)
The chairperson or his delegate shall allow the person initiating the proposed zoning amendment or his designee to present a description of the proposed zoning amendment and the reason for initiating the proposed zoning amendment. A failure of the applicant or his representative holding power-of-attorney to be present for the hearing shall result in automatic termination of any proceedings on the amendment and an adverse recommendation on the proposed amendment shall be forwarded to the mayor and council, unless the applicant can show just cause by reason of health emergency, in which case the application may be refiled by the applicant for consideration at a later date.
(4)
The chairperson or his delegate shall enter into the record after the presentation of the applicant or his representative any written comment, petition or similar written statement received by the planning commission prior to the hearing, and the same shall be considered by the mayor and council with comments and proceedings of the hearing in making any zoning decision concerning the proposed zoning amendment.
(5)
The chairperson or his delegate shall give persons opposed to the proposed amendment the opportunity to address the planning commission.
(6)
The chairperson or his delegate may alternate the presentations of persons speaking in favor of and opposed to the proposed zoning amendment beginning with the presentation of the applicant or his representative, or the chairperson or his delegate may divide such presentations into blocks of time beginning with proponents of the proposed zoning amendment and thereafter moving to the presentations of opponents of the proposed zoning amendment. Further, the chairperson or his delegate may direct that proponents and opponents designate one or more spokespersons for presentations of favorable and opposing views of the proposed zoning amendment. The chairperson or his delegate may poll the public assemblage at the hearing concerning their concurrence in the remarks of any speaker.
(7)
Any remark amounting to attack on the character or personal integrity of another individual, or comment not factually supportable, or comment in the form of an emotional outburst, shall be non-germane to the purpose of any hearing and may be ruled out of order.
(8)
Upon conclusion of the presentation of persons opposing the proposed zoning amendment, the chairperson or his delegate shall afford the person initiating the petition an allotted time to address the planning commission in rebuttal of any issues raised by persons addressing the planning commission in opposition to the proposed zoning amendment. The chairperson or his delegate may rule out of order the raising of any new issues in rebuttal unless he deems the raising of such new issues useful to the purposes of the hearing, in which case those persons present and opposing the proposed zoning amendment shall be allocated an equal amount of time through a spokesperson or otherwise to address such new issues.
(9)
When proponents and opponents of the proposed zoning amendment have been heard in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairperson or his delegate shall declare the public hearing closed. No further public hearing on the proposed zoning amendment shall be required prior to the final zoning decision.
(Code 2003, § 154.07; Ord. of 11-14-2000)
Sec. 125-8. - Zoning standards.
Exercise of the zoning power of the city shall constitute an effort to balance the interest of the community in promoting the public health, safety, morality or general welfare against the right of property owners to the unrestricted use of their property. The following standards are determined to be relevant in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality or general welfare against the right to unrestricted use of the property.
(1)
Standards.
a.
Whether the proposed amendment would allow a use that is generally suitable for the site compared to other possible uses and the uses and zoning of adjacent and nearby properties;
b.
Whether the proposed amendment would adversely affect the economic value or the uses of adjacent and nearby properties;
c.
Whether the property to be affected by the proposed amendment can be used as currently zoned;
d.
Whether the proposed amendment, if adopted, would result in a use which would or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, schools, sewers, water resources, police and fire protection or other utilities;
e.
Whether the subject property under the proposed amendment is in conformity with the policies and intent of the adopted joint comprehensive plan for the county and the cities of Blue Ridge, McCaysville, Mineral Bluff and Morganton, as amended;
f.
Whether there are other conditions or transitional patterns affecting the use and development of the subject property, if applicable, which give grounds for either approval or disapproval of the proposed amendment.
(2)
The city shall consider any proposed zoning amendment properly initiated in light of the standards set forth in subsection (1) of this section. In evaluating the standards set forth in subsection (1) of this section, it shall be the policy of the city to exercise its zoning power in conformity with the policy and intent of the joint comprehensive plan for the county and the cities of Blue Ridge, McCaysville, Mineral Bluff and Morganton insofar as that plan is current in its application to the specific property that is the subject of the proposed amendment. It is further the policy of the city to exercise the zoning power for purposes of assuring the compatibility of the use of adjacent and nearby properties and the preservation of the economic value of adjacent and nearby properties while enabling a reasonable use of all property.
(3)
The granting of a conditional use (special use) does not constitute a permanent change in zoning or use. The conditional use can be forfeited if it does not meet the review criteria. To ameliorate the impact of a conditional use on surrounding property, no conditional use may be granted without special provisions for conditions, criteria, standards and/or requirements as to the particular use. A permit for a conditional use (special use) shall be approved or denied, provided that due consideration is given to the following objective criteria as applicable to the specific use proposed at the specific site requested:
a.
Whether the proposed use impacts negatively or positively the anticipated volume of traffic flow or pedestrian safety in the vicinity;
b.
Whether the hours and manner of operation of the conditional use (special use) have no adverse effects on other properties/uses in the vicinity;
c.
Whether refuse areas, parking or loading/service areas on the property will be located or screened to protect other properties in the vicinity from noise, light, glare or odors;
d.
Whether the height, size or location on the building or other structures on the property are compatible with the height, size or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties;
e.
Whether the size of the lot is sufficient for the proposed use, accounting for growth opportunity that will not infringe upon the requirements of the zoning ordinance nor infringe upon the relationship to surrounding land;
f.
And satisfying the criteria of subsections (3)a through e of this section, whether the benefits of and need for the proposed use are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damages to the neighboring properties.
(Code 2003, § 154.08; Ord. of 11-14-2000)
Sec. 125-9. - Official action.
Consideration of any proposed zoning decision properly initiated and subsequent to the public hearing shall be as follows:
(1)
The planning staff of the city shall make a report of its investigation of the proposed zoning decision to the planning commission, commenting on the advisability of adopting any proposed zoning amendment. The report of the planning staff shall be in writing, addressed to the planning commission. Further, the planning staff's report shall provide an evaluation of each of the standards set forth in section 125-8(1) (or section 125-8(3), as applicable) and describe how the planning staff's advice is considered to be consistent with the exercise of zoning power set forth in subsection (2) of this section. A summary of the proceedings of the public hearing shall accompany the planning commission's written recommendation to the mayor and council.
(2)
Powers of the planning commission.
a.
Upon conclusion of the public hearing, the planning commission may approve, disapprove or table the proposed zoning decision. The planning commission may recommend and/or the mayor and council may amend an application prior to acting thereon:
1.
To reduce the size of the area affected by the amendment;
2.
To change the requested zone district to a less intensive or lower density district than the requested zone;
3.
To specify conditions that are deemed relevant to the public interest regarding site plans, ingress/egress, buffers and infrastructure related to drainage, utilities, traffic and other matters.
b.
The powers provided in subsection (2)a of this section are not in limitation of any other zoning powers accorded to the city under the laws of the state. If the planning commission fails to recommend action on the zoning decision in writing within 45 days of the close of the public hearing and the applicant does not agree in writing to an extension of the time limit, the applicant may take the proposed zoning decision to the mayor and council without a planning commission recommendation.
c.
If consideration of the proposed zoning amendment is tabled, it shall be reconsidered by the planning commission no later than its next regular monthly meeting. In any event, the commission shall have 45 days from the date of the close of the public hearing before the planning commission to review and submit its written recommendation to the mayor and council. Once an application for a zoning decision has been filed and the planning commission holds the public hearing, the planning commission shall make a recommendation on the proposed zoning decision and the mayor and council shall take a final action, regardless of whether or not the applicant withdraws his or its application for the proposed amendment.
(3)
The authority of the planning commission and planning staff in any zoning decision shall be advisory only. Any zoning decision shall be made by the mayor and city council, who shall either approve or disapprove the proposed zoning amendment. Any approval of a proposed zoning decision may be subject to any and all lawful conditions determined by the governing authority that are attached to the ordinance approving the proposed zoning decision.
(4)
If the mayor and city council shall take official action defeating a proposed zoning amendment which seeks to rezone property or approve a conditional use (special use), the same property may not be considered again for rezoning or conditional use (special use) until the expiration of 12 months from the date of the official action of the mayor and council.
