ARTICLE 3. - CORD COMMUNITY-ORIENTED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
DIVISION 300. - CORD COMMUNITY-ORIENTED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 300-010. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose and intent of the board of commissioners in establishing the CORD (Community-Oriented Residential Development) District is to establish a zoning district classification which promotes the public health, safety, and general welfare by permitting greater flexibility in site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of development rather than a lot-by-lot regulation, consistent with the policies and intent of the Newton County Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance. The CORD district is not intended to encourage greater density of development, but rather to encourage:
A.
More diversity in residential patterns;
B.
Creativeness and innovation in land planning;
C.
Quality development of attractive and cohesive design;
D.
Compatibility with surrounding land uses;
E.
Provision of adequate public facilities and services; and
F.
Amenities to serve the recreational, educational, and social needs of residents in order to create a more self-sufficient community.
Sec. 300-020. - Standards for CORD development.
All CORD developments shall require careful consideration by the governing authorities and should be allowed only on the following conditions:
A.
The proposed community-oriented residential development district accomplishes, by the use of permitted flexibility and variation in design, a development that has a greater net benefit to the county than that resulting from conventional development under the development regulations. Net benefit to the county may be demonstrated by one or more of the following factors:
1.
Creation of a community of compact scale and design, which encourages pedestrian circulation;
2.
Creation of a design featuring amenities and accessory uses that increases the energy efficiency and self-sufficiency of the neighborhood with respect to its use of single-occupant automobiles without undermining the basic residential character of the neighborhood. Community facilities and accessory commercial uses are so located as to be accessible to residents of the community within a five-minute walk;
3.
Interconnected usable open space;
4.
Recreation facilities;
5.
Other public facilities;
6.
Aesthetic features and harmonious design.
B.
Said proposed use would not substantially alter or adversely affect nearby property values.
C.
Said proposed use would not be incompatible with existing land use within the area; the perimeter of the community-oriented residential development district is compatible with the existing or permitted land use of both the property that directly adjoins the subject property and the property that is located directly across the street from the subject property.
D.
Said proposed use would not be inconsistent with the goals and policies of the Newton County Comprehensive Land Use Plan or with the purposes of this ordinance.
E.
The site plan for said proposed use provides for adequate ingress and egress of vehicular traffic and would not create safety, health, or unreasonable traffic problems in the area.
F.
There are adequate provisions made for the community facilities such as water, sewer, recreation, and open space; the community-oriented residential development district results in less burden on present and projected public services and utilities than would result from conventional subdivision development.
G.
Off-street parking and loading area space shall be provided in accordance with division 515 of this ordinance.
H.
The proposal is justified based on facts presented to indicate the need for such development, as called for in the Newton County Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
I.
Program for unified control. Each applicant for the community-oriented residential development zoning classification shall provide a legal mechanism for unified control of the entire parcel. During the development process more than one builder may participate in the development of the approved plan so long as each parcel of land remains subject to all of the terms and conditions of the plan approved by the board of commissioners for the property as a whole.
J.
Maintenance and protection of land held in common ownership. Each applicant shall present as a part of the application for the CORD zoning designation a legal mechanism plan under which all land to be held in common ownership and used for open space purposes shall be protected in perpetuity as provided in division 430 of this ordinance.
K.
Public streets required.
1.
All streets within community-oriented residential development districts shall be public streets. The design and construction of said streets shall comply in all respects with the requirements of the Newton County Development Regulations, and any other applicable provision of the code.
2.
All public streets serving the development, both existing and proposed, must be suitable in design and adequate in capacity to carry the anticipated traffic within the proposed project and in the vicinity of the proposed project.
L.
Sidewalk requirements. Sidewalks must be constructed in accordance with the Newton County Development Regulations.
M.
Off-street parking requirements. Off-street parking requirements for uses and structures authorized and permitted in the CORD District are as required in section 515-020 for each use, except as follows:
1.
Accessory commercial uses shall provide parking as follows:
a.
Retail uses: not more than one space for each 250 square feet of floor space devoted to such use;
b.
No parking space for any accessory commercial use shall be permitted to be located in the front yard of such accessory commercial use.
N.
Transitional buffers. Transitional buffers as provided in section 520-020 are required with respect to external boundaries of the CORD development. Transitional buffers are not required between adjacent land uses within the CORD development except where otherwise required in this division of the zoning ordinance.
O.
Landscaping. All CORD developments must meet the requirements of the development regulations regarding tree protection and landscaping.
P.
Phasing of projects. CORD development may be phased. Where an applicant desires to phase such development, the schedule for development shall be submitted and is subject to approval as a condition of zoning. In all cases where a project is permitted to be phased, each phase of the project shall contain the required parking spaces, open space, recreation space, landscaping, and utilities required for that phase.
Sec. 300-030. - Application procedures.
