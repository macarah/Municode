(3)
Method of calculation.
a.
Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this article shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
b.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, the calculation of impact fees shall be the net of the present value of ad valorem tax or other revenues. Such revenues shall be as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and are those which:
1.
Are reasonably expected to be generated by new development; and
2.
Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which an impact fee is imposed.

The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this article shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of the county and may be amended from time to time by official act.
d.
In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee shall also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities.
e.
Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
(Ord. No. O-020105, § 4, 2-1-2005)

When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure.
(3)
In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then:
a.
The administrator in his/her/their sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee.
b.
In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule.

(4)
If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit or approval of a certificate of occupancy. An adjustment may result in a refund to the feepayor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid.
(5)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit.
(c)
Individual assessment determinations. Individual assessments of development impact fees may be established as follows:
(1)
At their option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project.

(d)
Fee certification. Upon application to the administrator, a developer may receive a certified schedule of development impact fees for categories of development or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable. Such certified schedule or fee shall establish the development impact fee due for a period of 180 days from the date of certification, even if new or revised rate schedules are adopted in the interim.

If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his/her/their predecessor in title or interest) for system improvements that are included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the county comprehensive plan, prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, is greater than the impact fee that would otherwise have been paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, any credit due under this section shall not constitute a liability of the county, and shall accrue to the developer to the extent of impact fees assessed for new development for the same category of system improvements within the same service area.
c.
In no event shall credit be given for project improvements, or for system improvements not included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
(2)
Granting of credits.
a.
Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his/her/their predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that:
1.
The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the county comprehensive plan;
2.
The amount of the credit does not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding, as shown in the capital improvements element; and
3.
The board of commissioners shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction, dedication, or transfer.
b.
The credit allowed pursuant to this article shall not exceed the impact fee due for such system improvement unless a greater credit is allowed under a private agreement executed under the provisions of this article. In the event that a developer enters into such a private agreement with the county to construct, fund, or contribute system improvements such that the amount of the credit created is in excess of the impact fee which would otherwise have been paid for the development project, the developer shall be reimbursed for such excess construction, funding, or contribution from impact fees paid by other development located in the service area which is benefited by such improvements.
(3)
Guidelines for credit valuation. Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines:
a.
For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his/her/their predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated.
b.
For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his/her/their predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated.
c.
For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his/her/their predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that the county would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less.
d.
For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his/her/their predecessor in title or interest accepted by the county, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated.
e.
In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a state, AA rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the board of commissioners in its sole discretion may deem appropriate.
(4)
Credits; application.
a.
Credits shall be given only upon written request of the developer to the administrator. A developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the administrator at or before the time of development impact fee assessment.

The administrator, in his/her/their sole discretion, shall review all claims for credits and make determinations regarding the allowance of any claimed credit, and the value of any allowed credit.
c.
Any credit approved by the administrator shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator and calculated at the time of impact fee assessment.
(5)
Credits; abandoned building permits. In the event that an impact fee is paid but the building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the impact fee against future impact fees for the same parcel of land, upon submission of adequate evidence to the administrator that an impact fee was received by the county, the amount paid, and that the building permit was abandoned.
(Ord. No. O-020105, § 7, 2-1-2005)
Sec. 34-37. - Exemptions.
(a)
Exemption policy. The county recognizes that certain office, retail trade and industrial development projects provide extraordinary benefit in support of the economic advancement of the county's citizens over and above the access to jobs, goods and services that such uses offer in general. To encourage such development projects, the board of commissioners may consider granting a reduction in the impact fee for such a development project upon the determination and relative to the extent that the business or project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the county. Such determination of public benefit and the extent of a grant of exemption shall be based upon the county impact fee exemption standards adopted by the board of commissions; which standards reflect the type of development, the amount of capital investment and annual economic impact, and the number and value of jobs created or retained, and emphasize development within the county's industrial parks and the expansion/retention of businesses and industries already located within the county. It is also recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees.
(b)
Requests for approval of exemptions. Requests for approval of exemptions shall be filed with the administrator in accordance with the provisions and requirements of the adopted the county impact fee exemption standards. Exemption requests will be considered by the board of commissions for approval at their next regularly scheduled meeting following review and recommendation of the administrator.
