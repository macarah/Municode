ARTICLE IX. - REPORTING AND AUDITS

Sec. 6-242. - Reporting requirements for eating establishments.
(a)
Each licensee for sale of alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption operating as an eating establishment shall, as a condition of maintaining such license, file with the development services department within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter:
(1)
A sworn statement on forms approved by the county of the licensee's retail sales during the preceding calendar quarter. Such statements shall reflect the licensee's total dollar sales amounts for the applicable calendar quarter, the total sales amounts for sales of malt beverages and wine, the total sales amounts for distilled spirits sold by the drink, and total dollar sales for prepared food items and all food items.
(2)
Certified copies of the licensee's state department of revenue sales and use/tax monthly reports as filed with state department of revenue for each month during the applicable calendar quarter.
(b)
Each licensee for sale of alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption operating as an eating establishment shall, as a condition of maintaining such license, file with the development services department a sworn statement on forms approved the county of the licensee's employees. Such statements shall list all employees, with their home addresses and home telephone numbers, and a list of all alcohol awareness servers that are employed and a copy of the certificate for each alcohol awareness server. The initial statement shall be submitted no later than 60 days after receipt of the license and subsequent statements shall be submitted May 15 and November 15 of each year.
(c)
Any sale of a food or beverage containing any alcoholic beverage shall be deemed to be a sale solely of malt beverages, wine or distilled spirits as the case may be, and no such sale shall be included as food sales in the quarterly reports. The fact that the sale of food during any calendar quarter meets or exceeds the requirements set forth in section 6-68 shall not be conclusive on the issue of whether the licensee is meeting the requirements of operating an eating establishment as herein defined; however, the failure of the food sales to meet the requirements set forth in section 6-68 shall be prima facie evidence that the principal business of the licensee is not that of serving food as required to meet the definition of an eating establishment.
(d)
Such quarterly statements shall be confidential in nature and shall not be open for public inspection except as may be required by state law. Such forms shall be used solely by the county for determination of whether or not the licensee remains qualified to hold its retail license for sale of alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption in accordance with the provisions of this article. Failure to timely file such statements shall be a violation of this article and a basis for the suspension or revocation of the license granted under this article. If, after appropriate notice and hearing, the judge of the magistrate court finds that a licensee's violation of this section is not willful and the licensee otherwise meets the requirements of an eating establishment as provided in this article, the judge shall have the option of imposing a probationary period on the licensee, not to exceed six months, and any further violations shall be a basis for revocation of such license.
