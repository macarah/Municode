ARTICLE V. - SPEED HUMP POLICY

Sec. 46-106. - Policies.
In response to numerous complaints about speeding problems in neighborhoods, the county board of commissioners has studied other similar communities and how those communities have addressed residential speeding problems. One popular and cost effective measure is the installation of speed humps. When properly designed and installed, and with strong community support, speed humps are effective at reducing speeds in neighborhoods. After much experimentation and testing, the use of speed humps has been formally endorsed by transportation authorities worldwide. In the United States, a policy on the use of speed humps has been developed by a special committee of the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The speed hump policy has been established for the citizens of the county who want to pursue the installation of speed humps in their neighborhoods.
(2001 Code, § 11-106(1); Ord. of 6-3-1997)
Sec. 46-107. - Location.
The county will only consider installation of speed humps on streets classified as local, residential streets.
(2001 Code, § 11-106(A); Ord. of 6-3-1997)
Sec. 46-108. - Installation.
The county will only install speed humps if the county commission chairperson, after conducting a limited study, determines that the installation of a speed hump will alleviate the alleged speed problems.
(2001 Code, § 11-106(B); Ord. of 6-3-1997)
Sec. 46-109. - Petition for study.
Via informal petition, or a letter from an officer of an organized homeowner group, the homeowners of a neighborhood may request that their neighborhood be studied for the speed hump program. This letter or petition must represent a substantial percentage of the homeowners in that neighborhood.
(2001 Code, § 11-106(C); Ord. of 6-3-1997)
Sec. 46-110. - Determination.
After receiving the informal petition, the county commission chairperson will conduct a limited study to determine if the installation of a speed hump will alleviate the alleged speed problems. If so, then, via formal petition, 65 percent of the property owners must affirm the installation of speed humps.
(2001 Code, § 11-106(D); Ord. of 6-3-1997)
Sec. 46-111. - Design.
The geometric design of the speed humps has been proven to be a critical factor in their effectiveness. Based on extensive research, speed humps will be constructed with the specifications as determined by the county.
(2001 Code, § 11-106(E); Ord. of 6-3-1997)
Sec. 46-112. - Cost.
Property owners will pay for the installation and maintenance of the speed humps. These charges will show up as a separate entry on their annual property tax statement. The cost will be $12.00 per property per year.
(2001 Code, § 11-106(F); Ord. of 6-3-1997)
Sec. 46-113. - Removal.
(a)
The county will remove speed humps if:
(1)
Sixty-five percent of property owners, via formal petition, request their removal;
(2)
The humps have been in place at least one year; and
(3)
The homeowners are made aware that speeds will increase.
(b)
For subdivisions not completely built out, a minimum of 30 percent of the total units must be occupied before any petition for the installation of speed humps will be considered, and a minimum of 60 percent of the total units must be occupied before a petition for the removal of speed humps will be considered.
(c)
The county board of commissioners takes the position that, while speed humps are effective in reducing speeds in neighborhoods, their installation may be controversial. The key is that property owners be presented the facts as known so that they may make an informed decision.
(2001 Code, § 11-106(G); Ord. of 6-3-1997)
Sec. 46-114. - Procedure.
(a)
Objective. The objective of the county speed hump program is to provide property owners a process to install asphaltic speed humps on county maintained neighborhood roads, where engineering studies indicate that their use would achieve the desired result of reducing neighborhood speeds and their installation is favored by a majority of the property owners in the neighborhood.
(b)
Formal petition requirements. To have speed humps installed in the county, a petition must be submitted to the board of commissioners. All of the property owners in the subdivision or defined service area should be contacted and given an opportunity to sign this petition, indicating their "yes" or "no" concerning the installation of speed humps.
(1)
Unless property is undergoing change of ownership, a wife's signature will not be acceptable if she is not the legal owner. If both husband and wife are joint legal owners, both signatures are required. A "Mr. and Mrs." signature is not acceptable.
(2)
The owners must sign individually. This includes owners of undeveloped lots; renting tenants are not an acceptable substitute for the legal homeowner.
(3)
No signature may be withdrawn from the petition after it is filed with the board of commissioners.
a.
The percentages will be calculated, based on individual lots where owners sign affirmatively, divided by the total number of lots in the plotted subdivision, units, or defined service area. Each lot counts as only one vote, regardless of the number of owners signing. At least 65 percent of the homeowners must vote in favor of the speed humps, before a petition can be presented to the board of commissioners.
b.
The completed petition must be signed, notarized and then returned to this office, where it will be checked against tax records and land lot maps to ensure that it meets all requirements. It will be returned to the sender if it does not meet the requirements. Petitions that do meet the requirements will be presented to the commissioners at its regular meeting. A public hearing will be announced at that time for each petition. At the public hearing, the petition will be approved or disapproved by the board of commissioners.
1.
Installation. The installation of the speed humps by the contractor will not be considered final until personnel of this office inspects the humps for compliance with design specifications.
2.
Time. The time span from receiving the petition to installation will be approximately four months or less.
3.
Cost. Annualized charges for initial installation, maintenance and repair of speed humps are added to the property tax bills at the end of the year. Each platted lot, whether developed or not, will be subject to the assessed charges. The rate for participation in the speed hump program will be $12.00 per year per property in the defined service area.
4.
Removal. Removal of speed humps can proceed if the board of commissioners is presented a formal petition requesting that speed humps be removed. At least 65 percent of the property owners must vote in favor of removing the speed humps. A petition to remove an installed speed hump must comply with the requirements of the formal petition to install a speed hump. A petition for removal will only be considered after speed humps have been in place for a period of at least one year after installation.
