(c)
If any person fails to comply with the order of the court within the time fixed, the county shall cause the building or premises to be forthwith repaired, torn down, or demolished, the hazardous materials removed, or the dangerous conditions remedied, as the case may be, at the expense of the county. If the owner thereof, within 30 days after notice in writing of the amount of such expense, fails, neglects, or refuses to repay the county the expense thereby incurred, the county shall issue a fi. fa. against the owner of the property for the expense actually incurred.
(d)
