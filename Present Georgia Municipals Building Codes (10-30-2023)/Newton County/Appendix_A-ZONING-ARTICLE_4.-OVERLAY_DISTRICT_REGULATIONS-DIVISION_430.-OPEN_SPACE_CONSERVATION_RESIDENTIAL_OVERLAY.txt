DIVISION 430. - OPEN SPACE CONSERVATION RESIDENTIAL OVERLAY

Sec. 430-010. - Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose of this division to create an open space conservation residential overlay district that will:
A.
Preserve unique areas of Newton County that are in the path of development, and contain natural beauty, scenic views, historic rural character, and amenities that are irreplaceable;
B.
Create accessible open space and recreation amenities that adds value to contiguous land development;
C.
Minimize the environmental impacts of developments;
D.
Improve water quality and reduce runoff by reducing soil erosion and the area of impervious surfaces;
E.
Provide for a more flexible and attractive arrangement of subdivisions;
F.
Reduce the cost of development by reducing the length of utilities and the amount of impervious surface area;
G.
Reduce capital and operating costs of garbage collection, street and utility maintenance; and
H.
Save energy.
These purposes are to be achieved by allowing the transfer of density in the subdivision of a parcel into residential lots whereby individual lots are reduced in size and clustered on the most buildable portion of the parcel in exchange for reserving in perpetuity a significant amount of open space, natural habitat, and recreational area, including the natural areas of the parcel that are the most vulnerable to land disturbance.
Sec. 430-020. - Application.
The open space conservation residential overlay district shall be applied as follows:
A.
The owner of a parcel of land, or two or more contiguous parcels of land in single ownership or control, may make application to the zoning administrator to apply the provisions of this overlay district, provided that:
1.
The property is zoned for residential use;
2.
The property is a minimum of 25 acres;
3.
The property is proposed to be divided into at least ten residential lots;
4.
At least one-third of the parcel is to be conserved in minimally disturbed natural areas, hereinafter referred to as "open space," maintained for one or more of the following permitted uses:
a.
The preservation of undisturbed natural areas such as wetlands, forest, woodlands, buffer zones, meadows, wildlife corridors and game preserves;
b.
The preservation of historic and cultural resources;
c.
Agricultural, horticultural, silvicultural or pasture uses;
d.
Passive recreation areas such as parks, community gardens and play fields;

C.
Except for minimum lot sizes which shall be governed by this section, the provisions of other overlay zones regarding watershed protection, aquifer recharge areas, wetlands, and floodplain must also be met where applicable to such a parcel.
D.
If a parcel lies in more than one zoning district, then the allowed uses and standards required of the most restrictive district shall apply to the entire parcel.
(Ord. No. O-071712, § 8, 7-17-2012)
Sec. 430-030. - Standards for open space.
Open space required to be conserved pursuant to this overlay district shall be governed by the following standards:
A.
Essential access roads and utility lines shall be limited to the fewest number of perpendicular crossings necessary.
B.
Unless expressly permitted by the planning commission pursuant to section 430-070, no more than ten percent, up to a maximum of ten acres, of the open space to be conserved pursuant to this section shall be comprised of areas subject to land disturbing activities.
C.
Impervious surfaces such as parking lots, drives, walks, and buildings, within a conservation area or recreation area shall not be counted as required open space.
D.
Up to one-half of utility easements may be counted as required open space provided that such easements are unfenced; a minimum of ten feet wide and the easement provides access to, or is improved for, public recreation use.
E.
Non-contiguous "pocket parks" shall be a minimum of one-half acre to be included as open space for purposes of obtaining the minimum necessary open space to qualify for this overlay district. Unless expressly permitted by the planning commission pursuant to section 430-070, no more than ten percent, up to a maximum of ten acres, of the open space to be conserved pursuant to this section shall be comprised of "pocket parks."
F.
Accessibility of open space. Open space shall be designed and located for the convenient access and enjoyment of all residents of the subdivision.
G.
Interconnected open space network with adjoining property. It is the intent of this division that the protected open spaces, trails, and outdoor recreation areas in each subdivision be contiguous with open space and compatible areas containing similar features on abutting property. The design of developments utilizing this section should, where feasible, provide for maximum connections providing pedestrian and bike access to off-site and on-site attractions such as public trails, paths, parks, wildlife refuges, public facilities such as community centers, schools, libraries, fire and police stations, senior centers, railroad right-of-way, utility easements, and institutions such as universities, churches, museums and other cultural facilities.
Sec. 430-040. - Use standards.
Within the open space conservation residential overlay district, all uses permitted in the underlying zoning district shall be permitted. In addition, the following uses may also be permitted:
A.
Non-residential uses permitted in the CN zoning district may be permitted by conditional use, provided that:
1.
The open space conservation development contains at least 100 residential building lots;
2.
Non-residential uses are principally for the convenience of residents of the open space conservation development;
3.
No non-residential use is contained in a building with a floor plate larger than 3,000 square feet of gross floor area;
4.
The total land occupied by buildings containing non-residential uses, along with their related parking and driveways, does not exceed five percent of the total land area of the open space conservation development; and
5.
Non-residential uses meet all standards relating to non-residential uses in the CN zoning district and all standards of the Newton County Development Regulations.
B.
Mixture of residential and non-residential uses.
1.
Buildings containing a mixture of residential and non-residential uses are permitted as conditional uses provided that non-residential uses are limited to the ground floor only.
2.
For residential uses above non-residential, ground floor uses shall not be included for the purposes of calculating residential unit density.
3.
For residential uses above non-residential uses shall be developed in accordance with the development regulations of Newton County adopted March 4, 2003, as amended.
Sec. 430-050. - Residential lots.
The number of residential lots allowed in an open space conservation residential overlay district shall be calculated by the zoning administrator based on the density allowed for the underlying zoning district of which the parcel is a part. The maximum number of residential lots permitted shall be the result of dividing the total acreage of the parcel by the minimum lot size in the underlying zoning district, or the watershed protection overlay. (Example for R1, not in watershed: 25 acres x 43,560 square feet ÷ 25,500 square feet = 42 lots; Example for AR in a watershed: 25 acres x 43,560 square feet [÷] 87,120 [square feet] = 12 lots.)

The association may place liens on the homes or house lots of its members who fail to pay their association dues in a timely manner. Such liens may require the imposition of penalty and interest charges.
5.
The association shall continually maintain the open space. The members of the association shall share equitably the cost of maintaining and developing such open space. Shares shall be defined within the association bylaws. "Maintaining" the open space shall specifically include the elimination of plants identified as "noxious" or "undesirable" by the state, such as poison ivy and kudzu.
6.
In the event of a proposed transfer of open space land by the homeowners' association, notice of such action shall be given to all property owners within the development.
7.
The purposes of overlay district shall be enforced and the property protected in perpetuity by a conservation easement in favor of Newton County.
C.

[Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following rights are expressly reserved:]
[Insert Express Reservations, if desired with reference to whether prior notice to Grantee is required]
5.
Notice of Intention to Undertake Certain Permitted Actions. The purpose of requiring Grantors to notify Grantee prior to undertaking certain permitted activities, as provided in paragraph 4, if any, is to afford the Grantee an opportunity to ensure that the activities in question are designed and carried out in a manner consistent with the purpose of this Easement. Whenever notices is required Grantors shall notify Grantee in writing not less than 60 days prior to the date Grantors intend to undertake the activity in question. The notice shall describe the nature, scope, design, location, timetable, and any other material aspect of the proposed activity in sufficient detail to permit Grantee to make an informed judgment as to its consistency with the purpose of this Easement.
5.1
Grantee's Approval. Where Grantee's approval is required, as set forth in paragraph 4, if any, Grantee shall grant or withhold its approval in writing within 30 days of receipt of Grantor's written request therefor. Grantee's approval may be withheld only upon reasonable determination by Grantee that the action as proposed would be inconsistent with the purpose of this Easement.
6.
Grantee's Remedies. If Grantee determines that Grantors are in violation of the terms of this Easement or that a violation is threatened, Grantee shall give written notice to Grantors of such violation and demand corrective action sufficient to cure the violation and, where the violation involves injury to the Property resulting from any use or activity inconsistent with the purpose of this Easement, to restore the portion of the Property so injured. If Grantors fail to cure the violation within 30 days after receipt of notice thereof from Grantee, or under any circumstances where the violation cannot reasonably be cured within a 30-day period, fail to begin curing such violation until finally cured, Grantee may bring an action at law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Easement, to enjoin the violation, ex parte as necessary, by temporary or permanent injunction, to recover any damages to which it may be entitled for violation of the terms of this Easement or injury to any conservation values protected by this Easement, including damages for the loss of scenic, aesthetic, or environmental values, and to any such injury. Without limiting Grantors' liability therefore, Grantee, in its sole discretion, may apply any damages recovered to the cost of undertaking any corrective action on the Property.

Grantee's rights under this paragraph apply equally in the event of either actual or threatened violations of the terms of this Easement, and Grantors agree that Grantee's remedies at law for any violation of the terms of this Easement are inadequate and that Grantee shall be entitled to the injunctive relief described in this paragraph, both prohibitive and mandatory, in addition to such other relief to which Grantee may be entitled, including specific performance of the terms of this Easement, without the necessity of proving either actual damages or the inadequacy of otherwise available legal remedies. Grantee's remedies described in this paragraph shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to all remedies now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.
6.1
Costs of Enforcement. Any costs incurred by Grantee in enforcing the terms of this Easement against Grantors, including, without limitation, costs of suit and attorney's fees, and any costs of restoration necessitated by Grantor's violation of the terms of this Easement shall be borne by Grantors.

6.2
Grantee's Discretion. Enforcement of the terms of this Easement shall be at the discretion of Grantee, and any forbearance by Grantee to exercise its rights under this Easement in the event of any breach of any term of this Easement by Grantors shall not be deemed or construed to be a waiver by Grantee of such term or of any of Grantee's rights under this Easement. No delay or omission by Grantee in the exercise of any right or remedy upon any breach by Grantors shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver.
6.3
Waiver of Certain Defenses. Grantors hereby waive any defense of laches, estoppels, or prescription.
6.4
Acts Beyond Grantor's Control. Nothing contained in this Easement shall be construed to entitle Grantee to bring any action against Grantors for any injury to or change in the Property resulting from causes beyond Grantor's control, including, without limitation, fire, flood, storm, and earth movement, or from any prudent action taken by Grantors under emergency conditions to prevent, abate, or mitigate significant injury to the Property resulting from such causes.
7.
Access. No right of access by the general public to any portion of the Property is conveyed by this Easement.
8.
Costs and Liabilities.

Grantors shall keep the Property free of any liens arising out of any work performed for, materials furnished to, or obligations incurred by Grantors.
8.1
Taxes. Grantors shall pay before delinquency all taxes, assessments, fees, and charges of whatever description levied on or assessed against the Property by competent authority (collectively "taxes"), including any taxes imposed upon, or incurred as a result of, this Easement, and shall furnish Grantee with satisfactory evidence of payment upon request. Grantee is authorized but in no event obligated to make or advance any payment of taxes, upon ten days prior written notice to Grantors, in accordance with any bill, statement, or estimate procured from the appropriate authority, without inquiry into the validity of the taxes or the accuracy of the bill, statement, or estimate, and the obligation created by such payment shall bear interest until paid by Grantors at the maximum rate allowed by law.
8.2
Hold Harmless. Grantors shall hold harmless, indemnify, and defend Grantee and its members, directors, officers, employees, agents and contractors and the heirs, personal representatives, successors, and assigns of each of them (collectively "Indemnified Parties") from and against all liabilities, penalties, costs, losses, damages, expenses, causes of action, claims, demands, or judgments, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees, arising from or in any way connected with: (1) injury or death of any person, or physical damage to any property, resulting from any act, omission, condition, or other matter related to or occurring on or about the Property, regardless or cause, unless due solely to the negligence of any of the Indemnified Parties; (2) the obligations specified in paragraphs 8 and 8.1; and (3) the existence or administration of this Easement.
9.
Extinguishment. If circumstances arise in the future such as render the purpose of this Easement impossible to accomplish, this Easement can only be terminated or extinguished, whether in whole or in part, by judicial proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction, and the amount of the proceeds to which Grantee shall be entitled, after the satisfaction of prior claims, from any sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of all or any portion of the Property subsequent to such termination or extinguishment, shall be determined, unless otherwise provided by Georgia law at the time, in accordance with paragraph 9.1. Grantee shall use all such proceeds in a manner consistent with the conservation purposes of this grant.
9.1
Proceeds. This Easement constitutes a real property interest immediately vested in Grantee, which, for the purposes of paragraph 9, the parties stipulate to have a fair market value determined by multiplying the fair market value of the Property unencumbered by the Easement (minus any increase in value after the date of this grant attributable to improvements) by the ratio of the value of the Easement at the time of this grant to the value of the Property, without deduction for the value of the Easement, at the time of this grant. The values at the time of this grant shall be those values used to calculate the deduction for federal income tax purposes allowable by reason of this grant, pursuant to section 170(h) of the Internal Revenue Code 1954, as amended.
For the purpose of this paragraph, the ratio of the value of the Easement to the value of the Property unencumbered by the Easement shall remain constant.
9.2
Condemnation. If the Easement is taken, in whole or in part, by exercise of the power of eminent domain, Grantee shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with applicable law.
10.
Assignment. This Easement is transferable, but Grantee may assign its rights and obligations under this Easement only to the Newton County Land Trust Alliance, Inc. or to an organization that is a qualified organization at the time of transfer under section 170(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (or any successor provision then applicable), and the applicable regulations promulgated thereunder, and authorized to acquire and hold conservation easements under O.C.G.A. § 44-10-1 et seq. (or any successor provision then applicable). As a condition of such transfer, Grantee shall require that the conservation purposes that this grant is intended to advance continue to be carried out.
10.1
Executory Limitation. If Grantee shall cease to exist or to be a qualified organization under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, or to be authorized to acquire and hold conservation easements under O.C.G.A. § 44-10-1 et seq., and a prior assignment is not made pursuant to paragraph 10, then Grantee's rights and obligations under this Easement shall become immediately vested in the Newton County Land Trust Alliance, Inc. If the Newton County Land Trust Alliance, Inc. is no longer in existence at the time the rights and obligations under this Easement would otherwise vest in it, or if the Newton County Land Trust Alliance, Inc. is not qualified or authorized to hold conservation easements as provided for an assignment pursuant to paragraph 10, or if it shall vest in such rights and obligation as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct pursuant to the applicable Georgia law and with due regard to the requirements for an assignment pursuant to paragraph 10.
11.
Subsequent Transfers. Grantors agree to incorporate the terms of this Easement in any deed or other legal instrument by which they divest themselves of any interest in all or a portion of the Property, including, without limitation, a leasehold interest. Grantors further agree to give written notice to Grantee of the transfer of any interest to any person or entity other than a resident of the development or a homeowners' association at least 20 days prior to the date of such transfer. The failure of Grantors to perform any act required by this paragraph shall not impair the validity of this Easement or limit its enforceability in any way.
12.

Upon request by Grantors, Grantee shall within 30 days execute and deliver to grantors any document, including an estoppels certificate, which certifies Grantors' compliance with any obligation of Grantors contained in this Easement and otherwise evidences of the status of this Easement as may be requested by Grantors.
