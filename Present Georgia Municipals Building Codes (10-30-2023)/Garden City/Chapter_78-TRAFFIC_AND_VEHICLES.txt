Prior to the placement of a device within a school zone, each school within whose school zone such automated traffic enforcement safety device is to be placed shall first apply for and secure a permit from the Georgia Department of Transportation for the use of such automated traffic enforcement safety device. Such permit shall be awarded based upon need. The Georgia Department of Transportation shall promulgate rules and regulations for the implementation of this paragraph.
(c)
If an automated traffic enforcement safety device is moved to or placed in a location where an automated traffic enforcement safety device had not previously been moved to or placed in, no citation shall be issued for a violation recorded by that automated traffic enforcement safety device until:
(1)
The city shall erect signs warning of the use of a stationary speed detection device within the approaching school zone. Such signs shall be at least 24 by 30 inches in area, shall be visible plainly from every lane of traffic, shall be viewable in all traffic conditions, and shall not be placed in such a manner that the view of such sign is subject to being obstructed by any other vehicle on such highway. Such signs shall be placed within 500 feet prior to the warning sign announcing the reduction of the speed limit for the school speed zone. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that such signs are properly installed pursuant to this subsection at the time of any alleged violation under this article; and,
(2)
No citation shall be issued for the first 30 days after the first automated traffic enforcement safety device is introduced by a law enforcement agency within a school zone, but rather, a civil warning shall be issued for disregard or disobedience of the speed limit within the school zone.
(d)
A law enforcement agency authorized to enforce the speed limit of a school zone, or an agent working on behalf of a law enforcement agency or governing body, shall send by first class mail addressed to the owner of the motor vehicle within 30 days after obtaining the name and address of the owner of the motor vehicle but no later than 60 days after the date of the alleged violation:
(1)
A citation for the alleged violation, which shall include the date and time of the violation, the location of the infraction, the maximum speed at which such motor vehicle was traveling in photographically recorded images, the maximum speed applicable within such school zone, the civil warning or the amount of the civil monetary penalty imposed, and the date by which a civil monetary penalty shall be paid;
(2)
An image taken from the photographically recorded images showing the vehicle involved in the infraction;
(3)
A website address where photographically recorded images showing the vehicle involved in the infraction and a duplicate of the information provided for in this paragraph may be viewed;
(4)
A copy of a certificate sworn to or affirmed by a certified peace officer employed by a law enforcement agency authorized to enforce the speed limit of the school zone and stating that, based upon inspection of photographically recorded images, the owner's motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit in the marked school zone and that such disregard or disobedience was not otherwise authorized by law;
(5)
A statement of the inference provided by Georgia law and of the means specified therein by which such inference may be rebutted for such violations;
(6)
Information advising the owner of the motor vehicle of the manner in which liability as alleged in the citation may be contested through an administrative hearing before the municipal court of Garden City; and,
(7)

(e)
Proof that a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit of the marked school zone shall be evidenced by photographically recorded images. A copy of a certificate sworn to or affirmed by a certified peace officer employed by a law enforcement agency and stating that, based upon inspection of photographically recorded images, a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit in the marked school zone and that such disregard or disobedience was not otherwise authorized by law shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts contained therein.
(f)
Liability shall be determined based upon a preponderance of the evidence. Prima-facie evidence that the vehicle described in the citation issued pursuant to this Code section was operated in violation of the speed limit of the school zone, together with proof that the defendant was, at the time of such violation, the registered owner of the vehicle, shall permit the trier of fact in its discretion to infer that such owner of the vehicle was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. Such an inference may be rebutted if the owner of the vehicle:
(1)
Testifies under oath in open court or submits to the court a sworn notarized statement that he or she was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation; or,
(2)
Presents to the court a certified copy of a police report showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violation.
(g)
A violation for which a civil warning or a civil monetary penalty is imposed pursuant to this article shall not be considered a moving traffic violation for the purpose of points assessment under O.C.G.A. § 40-5-57. Such violation shall be deemed noncriminal, and imposition of a civil warning or civil monetary penalty pursuant to this article shall not be deemed a conviction and shall not be made a part of the operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed, nor shall it be used for any insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage.
(h)
If a person issued and mailed a citation pursuant to Code section 70-112(d)(1) fails to pay the civil monetary penalty for the violation or has not filed a police report or notarized statement pursuant to Code section 78-112(f) in no less than 30 nor more than 60 days after such mailing as determined and noticed by the law enforcement agency, the agent or law enforcement agency shall send to such person by first class mail a second notice of any unpaid civil monetary penalty, except in cases where there is an adjudication that no violation occurred or there is otherwise a lawful determination that no civil monetary penalty shall be imposed. The second notice shall include all information required in Code section 78-112(d) and shall include a new date of return which shall be no less than 30 days after such mailing as determined and noticed by the law enforcement agency. If such person notified by second notice again fails to pay the civil monetary penalty or file a police report or notarized statement pursuant to Code section 78-112(f) by the new date of return, such person shall have waived the right to contest the violation and shall be liable for the civil monetary penalty provided for under Code section 78-114(a), except in cases where there is an adjudication that no violation occurred or there is otherwise a lawful determination that no civil monetary penalty shall be imposed. Notices mailed by first class mail pursuant to this Code section shall be adequate notification of the fees and penalties imposed by this Code section 78-113(a). No other notice shall be required for the purposes of this Code section.

Except as otherwise provided pursuant to Georgia law, the provisions of law governing jurisdiction, procedure, defenses, adjudication, appeal, and payment and distribution of penalties otherwise applicable to violations under this Code section shall apply to enforcement under this article provided however, that any appeal from municipal court shall be by application in the same manner as that provided by O.C.G.A. § 5-6-35.
(j)
If a violation has not been contested and the assessed penalty has not been paid, the agent or city shall send to the person who is the registered owner of the motor vehicle a final notice of any unpaid civil monetary penalty authorized by this Code section 78-113 except in cases where there is an adjudication that no violation occurred or there is otherwise a lawful determination that no civil monetary penalty shall be imposed. The notice shall inform the registered owner that the agent or governing body shall send a referral to the Department of Revenue if the assessed penalty is not paid within 30 days after the final notice was mailed and that such referral shall result in the nonrenewal of the registration of such motor vehicle and shall prohibit the title transfer of such motor vehicle within this state.
(k)
The agent or city shall send a referral to the Department of Revenue not sooner than 30 days after the final notice required under 78-112(j) was mailed if a violation under this article has not been contested and the assessed penalty has not been paid.
