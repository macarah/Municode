Such sign shall be erected within ten feet of whatever boundary line of such land abuts the most traveled public road. If no public road abuts thereon, then such sign shall be erected to face in such a manner as may be most readily seen by the public. The lower edge of the sign face shall be of sufficient height so as to be read from the roadway. The sign shall show the present zoning classification, the proposed zoning classification, the scheduled date, time and place of the public hearing, and the telephone number to call for further information.

Conduct of hearing:
(1)
All public hearings by the mayor and council on zoning amendments shall be chaired by the mayor.

(3)
The director of the city's planning and zoning department shall advise the mayor and council of the recommendation of the planning commission when applicable.
(4)
The mayor shall determine the number of attendees who desire to testify or present evidence at the hearing.

Proponents, including the petitioner or the petitioner's agent requesting the zoning decision, shall have no less than ten minutes for the presentation of data, evidence, and expert opinions; opponents of the proposed decision shall have an equal minimum period of time. The mayor may grant additional time; provided, however, an equal period of time shall be granted both sides.
(6)

(8)
The mayor may limit repetitious comments in the interest of time and may call for a show of hands of those persons present in favor of or opposed to the proposed decision.

(10)
Once all parties have concluded their testimony, the mayor shall adjourn the public hearing.
(e)
Criteria for enactment. Prior to making a zoning amendment, the mayor and council shall evaluate the merits of a proposed amendment according to the following criteria:
(1)
Is this request a logical extension of a zoning boundary which would improve the pattern of uses in the general area?
(2)
Is this spot zoning and generally unrelated to either existing zoning or the pattern of development of the area?
(3)
Could traffic created by the proposed use or other uses permissible under the zoning sought traverse established single-family neighborhoods on minor streets, leading to congestion, noise and traffic hazards?
(4)
Will this request place irreversible limitations or cause material detriment on the area similarly zoned as it is or on future plans for it?
(5)
Is there an imminent need for the rezoning and is the property likely to be used for the use requested?
(6)
Would the proposed use precipitate similar requests which would generate or accelerate adverse land use changes in the zone or neighborhood?

Sec. 90-203. - Reasonable accommodation policy.
(a)
It is the policy of the City of Garden City, Georgia, pursuant to the Federal Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. (hereafter "FHAA") and Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act (hereafter "ADA", or collectively the "fair housing laws") to provide individuals with disabilities reasonable accommodation in its rules, regulations, standards, policies, practices, and procedures pertaining to housing and development to ensure equal access by persons with disabilities and to developers of housing for persons with disabilities. This section establishes a procedure for making requests for reasonable accommodations in land use, zoning, and development regulations as found and contained in this Code. It is the intent of the City of Garden City, its officials, staff, and agents to fully comply with the intent and purpose of fair housing laws.
(b)
Reasonable accommodation in land use, zoning, and development context means providing individuals with disabilities or developers of housing for people with disabilities, flexibility in the application of land use, zoning, and building regulations, policies, standards, practices, and procedures, or even waiving certain requirements altogether, when it is necessary to eliminate legal and regulatory barriers to housing opportunities.
(1)
For purposes of this section, an individual with a disability is someone who has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities; anyone who is regarded as having such impairment; or anyone with a history of such impairment. The terms "disability" and "handicap," for purpose of the fair housing laws have the same meaning.
(2)
A request for a reasonable accommodation may be made by any individual with a disability, his or her representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with disabilities, when the application of a land use, zoning, or development regulation, policy, standard, practice, or procedure acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. Development regulations shall mean those minimum standards set forth in this Zoning Code and shall not include Georgia Statewide Minimum Building Codes, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 8-2-20, or environmental regulations found in general law or the City's Code of Ordinances.
(c)
Notice of the availability of reasonable accommodation shall be prominently displayed on the city's website and shall state where applications for requesting reasonable accommodations are available to the public.
(d)
Any eligible person described in (b)(2) above may request a reasonable accommodation in the application of any land use, zoning, or development regulation, rule, standard, policy, practice, or procedure as described in subsection (b)(2) above, by completing and filing an application requesting reasonable accommodation with the director of planning and economic development. Persons requesting reasonable accommodation are encouraged to consult the director prior to submitting the application in order to make the nature of and need for the request clear.
(1)
All requests shall be made in writing, on forms provided by the city, and provide the following information:
a.
Name, address, and telephone number of person filing the request. When available, an email address should also be provided. When the request is being filed for the benefit of an individual with disabilities, the name, address, and telephone number for that person shall also be stated.
b.
Address of property; name, address and telephone number of property owner, if different from requestor.
c.
Detailed description of the requested accommodation and the regulation, rule, standard, policy, practice, or procedure for which accommodations is sought.
d.
Reason that accommodation is sought and any supporting documentation. If medical information is provided to support a determination that the requestor is a person with disabilities, it should be clearly marked as "Confidential" and will be used only as needed.
(2)
Any information identified by the applicant as confidential will be held and used by the city in such manner as to respect the individual's privacy rights and shall not be made available for public inspection.
(3)
A request for reasonable accommodation may be filed at any time; however, the city encourages its filing at the earliest opportunity to ensure the applicant with equal access to housing and to allow the city to make timely determinations of other related pending applications and permits. City staff will afford the applicant, upon request, such assistance as needed to ensure the application process is accessible and meaningful. There shall be no fee for requesting a reasonable accommodation.
(4)
Granting of a reasonable accommodation does not affect an individual's obligations to comply with other applicable regulations not at issue in the requested accommodation.
(e)
All requests for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by a committee consisting of the chairman of the city's consolidated board of zoning appeals and planning commission, the city manager, and the director of planning and economic development. A written decision on the request shall be issued to the applicant within ten business days of the receipt of a completed form (Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays excluded). After initial review of a request, the committee may request additional information from the applicant.
(f)
The written decision to grant, deny, or grant upon conditions a request shall be consistent with the fair housing laws and based upon the following facts:
(1)
Whether the housing, which is the subject of the request for reasonable accommodation, will be used by an individual(s) with disabilities protected by the fair housing laws;
(2)
Whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an individual with disabilities protected under the fair housing laws;
(3)
Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city; and
(4)
Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration of a material nature in the city's land use, zoning, or development policies.
Where the written decision is to deny the request, or grant the request subject to conditions, a sufficiently detailed explanation of the reasons shall be given the applicant. The decision of the review committee shall be final and binding upon the city. Notice of the decision shall be given the applicant by certified U.S. Mail, return receipt requested, unless the applicant consents to service in a different manner.
(g)
While a request for reasonable accommodation is pending, all laws, rules, regulations, standards, policies, practices, and procedures applicable to the property that is the subject to the request shall remain in full force and effect. This shall include any appeal of the decision until final.
(h)
Within 30 days of an adverse decision on a request for reasonable accommodation, an aggrieved person may file a petition for Writ of Certiorari in the Superior Court of Chatham County, Georgia. Nothing in this procedure shall preclude an aggrieved person from seeking other available federal or state remedies.

When a proposed zoning decision is sought to locate or relocate a halfway house, drug rehabilitation center, or other facility for the treatment of drug dependency, an additional public hearing shall be conducted at least six months and not more than nine months before the final action by the consolidated planning commission/zoning board of appeals or the mayor and council, as the case may be; such hearing shall be supplemental to the public hearing required under section 90-201(c) or section 90-215.
