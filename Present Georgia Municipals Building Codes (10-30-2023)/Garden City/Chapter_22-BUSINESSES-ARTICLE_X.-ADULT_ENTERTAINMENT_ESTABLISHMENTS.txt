Sec. 22-357. - Effect of article on other provisions.
At the time of the adoption of this article, some of the behavior regulated in this article is prohibited by section 90-47 of this Code. Nothing in this article shall be construed to repeal or invalidate the provisions of section 90-47 and it is the intent of the mayor and council that such conduct remain prohibited. However, if the enforcement of section 90-47 is enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, these provisions shall apply to all establishments falling within its restrictions during the continuation of such judicial intervention. During such a period, each such business must apply for a license. If it would qualify for such a business, the license and fee therefor shall be held by the city clerk until resolution of the judicial intervention. If such person does not meet the minimum restrictions of this article, then no license shall issue and the applicant will cease such activity until such time as the minimum qualifications can be met. If the restrictions of section 90-47 are invalidated or repealed, the restrictions in this article shall continue to apply to all such businesses.
