(a)
The city finance director shall cause a bill to be issued to each delivered to the last address shown for each taxpayer on the county tax digest. Failure on the part of the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for late payment, or failure to pay the tax. The tax bill contemplated herein shall adequately describe the property subject to the tax and list its fair market value as assessed. The bill shall also state the millage rate as adopted and the amount of the tax due. The bill shall also state the date after which taxes shall be considered in default and subject to the collection measures as set forth in this section.

Sec. 8-17. - Levy of executions, sale of real and personal property to satisfy unpaid taxes and assessments.
(a)
The city finance director shall cause all executions issued to be placed in the hands of the police chief for collection or levy and sale of the property. The police chief shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi. fa. In the event the police chief is unable to do so, the police chief shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi. fa.'s property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this section.
(b)
The police chief is hereby designated as the marshal of the city and delegated the duties as set forth herein. The police chief shall be subject to being ruled for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the municipality. After first paying the city finance director the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus, should such exist, to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes. Should there still exist a surplus after all subordinate claims are satisfied, the remainder shall be paid over to the defendant in fi. fa.
(c)
Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give twenty (20) days' written notice of the levy to the record owner(s) of the property and to the holder of each secured interest holder of record. The twenty-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner(s) of the land, the year(s) for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the city finance director.
(d)
Upon the passing of twenty (20) days after the notice contemplated in subsection (c) of this section has been delivered, the marshal shall publish weekly for four (4) weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted, an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the property owner(s) of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for the collection of taxes and/or special assessments, when applicable, due to the city and the year(s) for which taxes and special assessments have been executed.
(e)
When a levy is made on real property, the marshal shall give the defendant in fi. fa. an additional written notice of at least ten (10) days prior to the sale of said real property. The written notice shall be delivered by registered or certified U.S. mail, addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county commissioner. Notice is effective when deposited in the mail with adequate postage attached thereon.
(f)
Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal in the chambers of the city hall on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash. Should the first Tuesday of the month, however, fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the city, make any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied.
(g)
The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this Code section shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the persona against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy or sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provide, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired.
(h)
In the event that no bids are forthcoming on property offered for public sale in accordance with this section, the marshal may either re-advertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to a lack of bids.
(Ord. No. 2003-24, § 8, 8-18-03)
Sec. 8-18. - Bidding by City of Powder Springs at tax sales.
(a)
If, during any sale of property for taxes and/or special assessments, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is an amount equal to or greater than the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the sate, county and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city manager, or his designee, may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold.
(b)
Property acquired by the city pursuant to subsection (a) above may be divested or alienated by the city only by the public sale of the property to the highest bidder. However, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided herein.
(Ord. No. 2003-24, § 9, 8-18-03)

(Ord. No. 2003-24, § 11, 8-18-03)
Sec. 8-21. - Redemption rights of defendant in fi. fa.

(Ord. No. 2003-24, § 12, 8-18-03)
Sec. 8-22. - Costs.
(a)
For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the clerk of the superior court for recording and canceling the tax fi. fa.
(b)
Once a levy is made or posted on the property of a defendant in fi. fa., in addition to all taxes, interest, penalties and cost heretofore accrued, the marshal shall collect a levy administration fee of five (5) percent of the taxes and/or assessments due, when applicable, or two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), whichever is the lesser. However, no levy administration fee shall be less than fifty dollars ($50.00).
(c)
In addition to the levy administration fees, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual cost for advertising the sale, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property, plus a commission for conducting the sale, not to exceed eight (8) percent on sums of fifty dollars ($50.00) or less, six (6) percent on sums above fifty dollars ($50.00) up to five hundred fifty dollars ($550.00), and three (3) percent on all sums exceeding five hundred fifty dollars ($550.00).

(Ord. No. 2003-24, § 15, 8-18-03; Ord. No. 2008-19, § 1, 8-18-08)
Sec. 8-25. - Homestead exemption.
(a)
This section is passed pursuant to Article VII, Section II, Paragraph II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia of 1983, which authorizes the granting of homestead exemptions from ad valorem taxation levied by local taxing jurisdictions.
(b)
Each resident of the city who is disabled is granted an exemption from all municipal ad valorem taxes in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) on a homestead owned and occupied by such resident as a residence if his or her net income, together with the net income of his or her spouse who also occupies and resides at such homestead, as net income is defined by Georgia law, from all sources does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) for the immediately preceding taxable year for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this section, net income shall include, without limitation, income received as retirement, survivor, or disability benefits under the federal Social Security Act or under any other public or private retirement, disability, or pension system. The value of the residence in excess of the above-exempted amount shall remain subject to taxation. In order to qualify for the exemption provided for in this section, the person claiming such exemption shall be required to obtain a certificate from not less than one (1) nor more than three (3) physicians licensed to practice medicine under O.C.G.A. Chapter 34 of Title 43 certifying that such person is mentally or physically incapacitated to the extent that such person is unable to be gainfully employed and that such incapacity is likely to be permanent. Any such person shall not receive the benefits of such homestead exemption unless such person or his or her agent provides the tax commissioner of Cobb County with the certificates provided for in this section and files an application with such tax commissioner giving the amount of income which such person and his or her spouse received during the last taxable year for income tax purposes and such additional information relative to receiving the benefits of such exemption as will enable the tax commissioner to make a determination as to whether such person is entitled to such exemption. The tax commissioner shall provide the necessary forms for this purpose. Such applications shall be processed in the same manner as other applications for a homestead exemption, and the provisions of law applicable to the processing of homestead exemptions, as the same now exist or may hereafter be amended, shall apply thereto, but after any such person has filed the proper application and certificates, as provided above, and has been allowed the exemption provided in this section, it shall not be necessary that he or she make application and file such certificates thereafter for any year and such exemption shall continue to be allowed to such person. It shall be the duty of any such person, however, to notify the tax commissioner in the event he or she becomes ineligible for any reason for the exemption provided in this section. The increased exemption provided for in this section shall apply to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1992.
(c)
The exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section shall be in lieu of and not in addition to any exemption from Powder Springs municipal ad valorem taxes which is lower in amount for any taxable year and which is granted by the constitution or laws of this state.
