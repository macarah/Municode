Sec. 13-28. - Curfew for minors.
(a)
Purposes. The mayor and council for the city have determined that there has been an increase in juvenile violence and crime by persons under the age of eighteen (18) in Powder Springs resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior by juveniles; that persons under the age of eighteen (18) are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful activity and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime; that there has been a significant breakdown in the supervision and guidance normally provided by parents for minors resulting in an increase in the crimes, substance abuse, and school dropout rates, juvenile pregnancy, and other illicit behavior. The city has an obligation to provide for the protection of minors from each other and from other persons, for the enforcement of parental control over and responsibility for children, for the protection of the general public, and for the reduction of the incidence of juvenile criminal activities which are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances. The mayor and council have determined a curfew for those under the age of eighteen (18) will be in the interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare and will help to attain the foregoing objectives and to diminish the undesirable impact of such conduct on the citizens of the city and will promote the public good, safety and welfare.

Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.
(c)
A person committing the offense of loitering shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

Sec. 13-31. - Trespassing.
It shall be unlawful for any person to trespass upon the premises of another. A person commits the violation of trespassing when he intentionally enters or remains upon the land or premises of another person after receiving notice from the owner or rightful occupant, or upon proper identification, an authorized representative of the owner or rightful occupant, that such entry or presence is forbidden.

Sec. 13-32. - Community redevelopment tax incentive program.
(a)
Purpose. The existence of real property that is maintained in a blighted condition increases the costs to city budgets by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services.
In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, this mayor and council in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations in Chapter 61, Urban Redevelopment, of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread.
In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

The determination shall be in writing and copies thereof shall be served on the parties by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery. The determination by the board of construction appeals shall be deemed final. A copy of such determination shall be served upon the City of Powder Springs Tax Official and the Tax Commissioner of Cobb County, who shall include the increased tax on the next regular tax bill rendered on behalf of the city.

(2)
Before action on a petition to lift the designation, the public officer shall cause the property to be thoroughly inspected by a building inspector, who by written inspection report, shall certify that all requisite work has been performed to applicable code in a workmanlike manner, in accordance with the specifications of the plan of remedial action or redevelopment, or applicable court order. Upon finding required work to be satisfactorily performed, the public officer shall issue a written determination that the real property is no longer maintained in a blighted condition.

(f)
Decreased rate of taxation to be applied after successful remedial action or redevelopment of blighted property. Real property which has had its designation as maintained in a blighted condition removed by the public officer, shall be eligible for a decrease in the rate of city ad valorem taxation by applying a factor of 0.25 to the city millage rate applied to the property, so that such property shall be taxed at a lower millage rate than the millage rate generally applied in the municipality or otherwise provided by general law; such decreased rate of taxation shall be applied beginning with the next tax bill rendered following removal of official designation of a real property as blighted. The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depending on the amount of cost expended by the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00) or portion thereof equaling one (1) year of tax reduction; provided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in city ad valorem taxes for more than two (2) successive years.
(1)
In order to claim entitlement for a decreased rate of taxation, the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property shall submit a notarized affidavit to the public officer, supported by receipts or other evidence of payment, of the amount expended.
