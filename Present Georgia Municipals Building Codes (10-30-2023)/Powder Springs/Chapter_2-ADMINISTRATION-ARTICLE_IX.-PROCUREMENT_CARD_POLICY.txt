ARTICLE IX. - PROCUREMENT CARD POLICY

Sec. 2-300. - Purpose.
The purpose of this policy is to set requirements and standards for the City of Powder Springs Procurement Card Program. The policy is intended to comply with current State of Georgia program[s], Georgia statutes and establish more efficient guidelines for elected officials and other city employees using the procurement cards. This policy also pertains to any other government-issued credit cards, including gas and travel cards.
At no time should a city-issued procurement card be used for personal purchases regardless of the circumstances.

All purchases made using a government procurement card must be in accordance with these guidelines, with state law and with the State Procurement Card program policies.
