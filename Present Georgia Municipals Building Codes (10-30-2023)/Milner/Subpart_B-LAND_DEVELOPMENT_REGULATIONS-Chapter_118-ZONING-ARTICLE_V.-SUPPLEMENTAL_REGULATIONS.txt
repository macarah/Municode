(Ord. No. 2007-8, § 1, 3-21-2007)
Sec. 118-402. - Screening required.
Whenever screening is required by this chapter or as a condition of zoning imposed by the mayor and council, a durable masonry wall, or fence or hedge of sufficient opacity to provide a visual blind designed to be compatible with the character of adjoining properties, shall be provided. Such wall or fence shall be at least six feet in height, but no greater than eight feet in height, measured from the ground along the common lot lines of the adjoining properties. When hedges or natural plantings are used, together with the fence prescribed, to form the required screening, the minimum sufficient opacity shall be deemed to require no less than three feet of plantings and/or hedge in the area immediately adjacent to the fence, measured along the ground surface from the fence to the inside border of said plantings and/or hedge. Such plantings must be in place prior to the issuance of a building permit for any improvements. Hedges and plantings shall be of such variety that an average height of at least six feet could be expected by normal growth within no later than two years from the time of planting.
