Secs. 8-58—8-87. - Reserved.
ARTICLE IV. - LOT SIZING

Sec. 8-88. - Requirements.
(a)
To provide for the orderly and safe development of property utilizing on-site sewage management systems, minimum lot sizes have been established. Larger lot sizes may be required depending on the proposed development of the property. County health and zoning authorities may require larger minimum lot sizes in which event the larger minimum lot sizes will take precedence.
(b)
Table MT-1 provides lot size requirements for single-family dwellings, including, but not limited to, manufactured or mobile homes, stick built homes, modular homes, etc., and individual lots in subdivisions or mobile home lots located in areas other than commercial mobile home parks. Area requirements for multiple dwellings on a single recorded lot, where not prohibited by zoning regulations, must be provided in multiples of the minimum lot sizes shown in the table for each dwelling to be constructed on the recorded lot.

Minimum lot size 43,560 square feet 21,780 square feet
Minimum lot width 150 feet 100 feet
Maximum sewage flow 600 gpad** 1,200 gpad**
  * In this context, "non-public" means an individual water supply system or any other water supply system which is not a "public" water supply system.
** gpad = gallons per acre per day=gal/acre/day.
(c)
The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (three- or four-bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees, and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or cut-buildings, etc. are proposed to be constructed or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the county board of health will require larger lots to assure useable soil area.
(d)
The county board of health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features.
(e)
Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or non-public water supply system, respectively.
(f)
The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors.
(g)
There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent county zoning set-backs and other space requirements must also be met.
(h)
The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by non-public or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally.
Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine X= the square footage of the lot needed, use the following formula:
= 4.17 acres
= 4.17 acres x 43,560 ft 2 /acre
= 181,500 ft 2 area of land needed.
Likewise, for a non-public (individual) water supply, to determine Y= the square footage of the lot needed for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula:
Y=8.33 acres
Y=8.33 acres x 43560 ft 2 /acre
Y= 363,000 ft 2 area of land needed.
(i)
Subsections (c) through (h) of this section shall also apply to multifamily residential dwellings, all other non-single-family dwellings and commercial structures, and mobile homes located in commercial mobile home parks, in addition to the lot size requirements shown in Table MT-2.

** gpad=gallons per acre per day = gal/acre/day
(j)
In groundwater recharge areas, the rules of the state department of natural resources, environmental protection division, in Ga. Admin. Code ch. 391-3-16-.02 require the following minimum lot sizes:
(1)
Subdivisions and individual lots . New homes served by septic tank and absorption field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified in Table MT-1.
a.
150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of Table MT-1 if lot is within a high pollution susceptibility area;
b.
125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of Table MT-1 if lot is within a medium pollution susceptibility area;
c.
110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of Table MT-1 if lot is within a low susceptibility area.
(2)
Mobile home parks . New mobile home parks served by septic tanks and absorption field systems shall be on lots having the following size limitations as identified in Table MT-2.
a.
150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of Table MT-2 if lot is within a high pollution susceptibility area;
b.
125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of Table MT-2 if lot is within a medium pollution susceptibility area;
c.
110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of Table MT-2 if lot is within a low pollution susceptibility area.
(3)
If county health or zoning regulations require a larger lot size than that required in this section for mobile homes, the larger lot size shall be used.
(4)
The county may exempt from the requirements of this subsection any lot of record in existence prior to the date of adoption of the Ga. Admin. Code ch. 391-3-16-.02.
