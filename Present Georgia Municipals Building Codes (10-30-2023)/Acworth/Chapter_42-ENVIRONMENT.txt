ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 42-1—42-30. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - WETLAND PROTECTION

Sec. 42-31. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and population control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state.
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
The state department of natural resources and the state department of community affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdiction must adopt a wetlands protection ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated thereunder.
It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands that may adversely affect wetlands.
(b) Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of the City of Acworth, Georgia. The purposes of this article are to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. Activities which may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined by a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations, which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, ground water recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife areas and to comply with the requirements of state law related to wetland protection.

Sec. 42-32. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Functions means the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including: storage, conveyance, and attenuation of floodwater and storm water; protection of water quality and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical, and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic, and recreational amenities.
Generalized wetland map means a map (NWI) depicting jurisdictional wetlands within the city.
Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the soil conservation service.
Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions.
Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands ad determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Land disturbing activity means any activity, which may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediments into state water, wetlands or onto lands within the state. Activity includes, but is not limited to, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting, and filling of land, but not including commonly accepted agricultural practices.
Land disturbance activity permit (LDA) means a development permit issued by the city public works department for any land-disturbing activity.
Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in section 42-33(b) of this article and exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Silviculture means the art of producing, reproducing and growing a forest of distinctive stands of trees.
Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified herein.
Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophilic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
Wetland delineation means the establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps.

(Ord. No. 2002-04, § 2, 1-17-2002)
Sec. 42-33. - Wetland protection district established.
(a)
Wetland protection district. This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as devised herein and located within the incorporated region jurisdiction of the City of Acworth, Georgia. The generalized wetland map (NWI), adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and of the wetland protection district and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the city clerk and zoning department.
(b)
Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. No. 2002-04, § 3, 1-17-2002)
Sec. 42-34. - Local development permits.
(a)
Local development permit requirements.
(1)
No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the city department of public works in the form of a land disturbance activity permit (LDA). Issuance of a LDA is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. Prior to the issuance of a LDA, building permit, or a demolition permit the zoning administrator shall assess whether the proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands and, if so, shall also assess whether the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area. To assess whether the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, the zoning administrator shall consult the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map for Cobb County.
(2)
If the zoning administrator determines that the proposed activity is of a type that could not result in a disturbance of wetlands or if the proposed activity is not located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, the zoning administrator shall follow normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit.
(3)
If the zoning administrator determines that the proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands and that the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional wetland determination shall be required prior to issuance of a building permit or a demolition permit.
a.
If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that a Department of the Army permit is required, a building permit or a demolition permit shall be issued only following issuance of the Department of the Army permit.
b.
If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that the proposed activity would not require a Department of the Army permit, the zoning administrator shall proceed with normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit.
(b)
Permissible uses (use as a right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, drainage, or dredging except as provided herein.
