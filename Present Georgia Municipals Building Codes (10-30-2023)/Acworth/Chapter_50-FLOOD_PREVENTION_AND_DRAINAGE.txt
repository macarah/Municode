DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 50-71. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(5)
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and,
(6)
Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

"Substantial improvement" means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during a 10-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
(1)
Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or
(2)
Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure".
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.

Sec. 50-79. - Variance procedures.
The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this article. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the public works department, or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above.
(1)
Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be submitted to the public works department. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the public works department. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(2)
Any person adversely affected by any decision of the public works department shall have the right to appeal such decision to the city council as established by the city in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(3)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Cobb County, Georgia, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(4)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(5)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(6)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(7)
In reviewing such requests, the public works department and city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(8)
Conditions for variances:
a.
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
1.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
2.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and,
3.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
b.
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
c.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
d.
The public works department shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(9)
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the public works department and city council shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.
(10)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the public works department and the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this article.
(11)
Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

Sec. 50-95. - Floodway encroachments.
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (2) below.
(2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and,
(3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the public works department until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the public works department.

Sec. 50-111. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(2)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(3)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(4)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(5)
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the city's greenspace protection plan;
(6)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and
(7)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long- term follow up.
(b)
Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to this article. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria:
(1)
New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more;
(2)
Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more;
(3)
Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the city to be a hotspot land use; or,
(4)
Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items (b)(1) and (2) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules.
The following activities are exempt from this article, unless otherwise determined by the city:
(1)
Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project;
(2)
Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures;
(3)
Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and
(4)
Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the city.
(c)
Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.
(d)
Stormwater design manual. The city will utilize the policy, criteria and information including technical specifications and standards in the latest edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM) and any relevant local addenda for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article. The manual may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science, engineering, monitoring and local maintenance experience.

Secs. 50-126—50-147. - Reserved.
ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER UTILITY[6]

Footnotes:
--- (6) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2022-15 , § 1, adopted June 16, 2022, set out provisions intended for use as article V, §§ 50-118—50-129. To preserve the style of this Code, and at the editor's discretion with input from the city, these provisions have been included as article VI, §§ 50-148—50-159.

Sec. 50-148. - Purpose.
The City of Acworth, Georgia (the "city") is authorized by the supplementary powers provisions of article IX, section II, paragraph III(a)(6) of the Georgia Constitution State Constitution to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the geographic area of the city which services, systems and facilities contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare, and protection of the natural resources of the city. The Federal Clean Water Act places increased emphasis on the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting, and making available to its citizens and property owners stormwater management services which address water quality and volume impacts of stormwater runoff. The mayor and the board of aldermen has determined that development in the city to date, and the outlook for continued development at an increasing rate in the future, has created and will continue to create additional needs for stormwater management services, systems, and facilities within the city.
( Ord. No. 2022-15 , § 1, 6-16-2022)
Sec. 50-149. - Findings.
The mayor and board of aldermen make the following findings:
(1)
The city is authorized by the supplementary powers provisions of article IX, section II, paragraph III(a)(6) of the Georgia Constitution to provide a stormwater collection and disposal system throughout the city.
(2)
The Federal Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act emphasizes the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting, and funding stormwater programs which address water quality and the impact of stormwater runoff.
(3)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(4)
The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways. The service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs, and risk exposure.
(5)
The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities in the city which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the city and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in the city in concert with the management of other water resources in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for the stormwater management program, operating capital and investment needs.
(6)
The mayor and board of aldermen find, conclude, and determine that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in the city.
(7)
An equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service charges upon properties that is related to burden of stormwater quality control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city. Such schedule of service charges can be complemented by other funding methods which address specific needs, including but not limited to, allocations of special purpose local option sales taxes to stormwater drainage improvement projects. A service charge credit is an appropriate means of adjusting service charges in recognition that private stormwater systems and/or actions can effectively reduce or eliminate the burden of stormwater quantity and quality control service requirements and costs that a property or properties pose for the city. Impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city, and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater service charges and associated credits. In addition, the value to the stormwater utility of certain actions and practices performed by property owners and other stormwater utility customers may be recognized by credits based on other factors, including but not limited to, the avoided cost of public information and education realized by the utility when public information and education about stormwater management is provided by the public school system.
(8)
The "Stormwater Utility Study" prepared by CPL Architecture, Engineering, and Planning, dated 9/10/2020, properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities for all of the city.
(9)
Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities identified in the "Stormwater Utility Study," it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city in concert with similar programs in city.

Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater, the parcel's antecedent moisture and the parcel's geologic condition.
Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development.
Improved property means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 500 square feet of impervious surfaces.
Non-single family residential property or NSFR means improved property containing multiple dwelling unit residential properties, condominiums, apartments, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, tennis courts, swimming pools, public and private schools and universities, research facilities and stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses, water and wastewater treatment plants, and any other form of use not otherwise mentioned which is not a single family residential (SFR), and which has private parking lots and private drives or roads.
Public water influence zone means those areas lying downstream of a culvert, or other stormwater management conveyance system. On the downstream side of the conveyance system, the public water influence zone will extend for a length of six times the diameter (or width) of the culvert from which runoff is being discharged (Field Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Third Edition, pg. 99), and within the horizontal limits set forth in the aforementioned field manual. For example, if a 48-inch diameter culvert is discharging to a private property, the public water influence zone shall extend 24 feet (six times 48 inches) from the end of the culvert and for the specified width (i.e. typically the width of the creek). The city stormwater utility may perform maintenance and/or capital construction activities only within that portion of the public water influence zone which the city has an ownership interest in, or for which a dedicated easement has been granted to and accepted by the city for such purpose.
Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the city.
Stormwater management services mean all services provided by the city which relate to the:
(1)
Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated portions of the city;
(2)
Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities;
(3)
Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs;
(4)
Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems and facilities; and
(5)
Compliance with applicable state and federal stormwater management regulations and permit requirements.
Stormwater management services may address the quality of stormwater runoff as well as the quantity thereof.
Stormwater management systems and facilities mean those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey, detain, retain, treat, or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff.
Stormwater manager means the person appointed by the city manager to administer the provisions of this article.
Stormwater user fee charge means the periodic user fee charge imposed pursuant to this article by the city stormwater utility for providing stormwater management services. This term shall exclude special charges to the owners of particular properties for services, systems or facilities related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects, on-site stormwater control systems and other stormwater management services provided by the city for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered.
Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have minimal impervious surface, which impedes the infiltration of stormwater runoff or causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of 500 square feet or less of impervious surface.
User is defined as any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management.

Sec. 50-153. - Stormwater utility customer classes.
(a)
There shall be one stormwater utility service area in city with specified customer classes to reflect variations in services provided to stormwater utility customers and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city stormwater management program and drainage system. The specified customer classes for the city stormwater utility are as follows:
(1)
Single family residential (SFR) customers as defined in section 50-120 of this article.
(2)
Non-single family residential (NSFR) customers shall consist of all properties located in the city that are not classified as SFR.

( Ord. No. 2022-15 , § 1, 6-16-2022)
Sec. 50-154. - Stormwater user fee charges.
(a)
It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service areas shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services. Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city, including, but not limited to, plan review and inspection fees, fees for special services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, system development charges and special assessments.
(b)
To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities.
( Ord. No. 2022-15 , § 1, 6-16-2022)
Sec. 50-155. - Stormwater user fee charge rates.
(a)
Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the board of aldermen. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, and together with other sources of support available to the city stormwater utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city.
(1)
Single family residential (SFR) customer class. Single family residential properties shall be equal to 1.00 ERU and charged at a single ERU rate.
(2)
Non-single family residential (NSFR) customer class. NSFR properties shall be billed one ERU for each 3,300 square feet, or portion thereof, of impervious surfaces located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs for NSFR properties will be rounded to two decimal places to establish the actual number of ERUs for billing. If a NSFR property has less than 1.00 ERU, then the customer will be billed a minimum of 1.00 ERU.
(b)
Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be applied to customers as follows:
(1)
The stormwater user fee shall be established at the amount as approved annual by the mayor and board of aldermen as reflected in the fee schedule per ERU per year.
a.
All SFR customers shall be billed periodically for stormwater services on a schedule established by the board of aldermen.
(2)
The NSFR stormwater user charge for each ERU, or fractional ERU, shall be as follows:
a.
The amount as approved annually by the mayor and board of aldermen as reflected in the fee schedule.

Sec. 50-156. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions.
(a)
Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in the incorporated area of the city shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities.
(b)
Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows:
(1)
Parcels which contain one-tenth of an ERU or less of impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(2)
Railroad rights-of-way (tracks) shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(3)
Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way and road systems. However, maintenance buildings and/or other improved property used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. All other state, federal, county, and City of Acworth properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties.
(4)
Basins used for the development or treatment of drinking water or wastewater, such as water reuse ponds, aerators, clarifiers, sedimentation, and flocculation tanks, in use by public utilities.
( Ord. No. 2022-15 , § 1, 6-16-2022)
Sec. 50-157. - Enforcement methods and inspections.
(a)
All property owners of improved property within the incorporated areas of the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable city development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the city municipal court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense, subject to the penalties set forth in section 50-117 of this Code.
(b)
Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater manager, the city may elect to sue in the city municipal court to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the city municipal court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of filing of such abatement action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the city municipal court.
(c)
The city shall have the right for its designated officers and employees to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours, and after reasonable notice to the owner thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law. Such inspections shall generally be limited to the following purposes:
(1)
Inspecting or conducting engineering analyses on existing stormwater management systems and facilities located on-site; or
(2)
Determining that stormwater management systems and facilities need to be constructed.
( Ord. No. 2022-15 , § 1, 6-16-2022)
Sec. 50-158. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments.
Failure to receive a stormwater utility bill is not justification for non-payment. The property owner, as identified from public land records of City of Acworth, shall be obligated to pay the appropriate stormwater user fee charge for that property.
The stormwater service fee may be billed separately, or on a customer statement and collected along with other fees for services, at the city's sole discretion, provided that in no instance shall the service fee constitute a direct lien against the parcel. Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by state law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby.
A stormwater service fee bill may be sent through the United States mail or by alternative means notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is underbilled or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may backbill for a period of up to one year but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency due to the failure to send a bill or an under billing. A one percent per month late charge shall be assessed against the owner for the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility service charge that becomes delinquent.
( Ord. No. 2022-15 , § 1, 6-16-2022)
Sec. 50-159. - Appeals, hearings.
(a)
Appeals. An appeal to the city manager may be taken by any property owner or customer aggrieved by any decision of the stormwater manager. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days of the decision of the stormwater manager by filing with the city manager a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of the notice of appeal, the stormwater manager shall forthwith transmit to the city manager all documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken.
(b)
Hearing. The city manager shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give written notice to the appellant at least ten days prior to the hearing date. The notice shall indicate the place, date, and time of the hearing. The city manager shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the stormwater manager after hearing the evidence. If the decision of the stormwater manager is reversed in whole or in part, resulting in a refund or credit due to the property owner, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal.
(c)
The decision of the city manager shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the city manager may appeal that decision to the superior court of Cobb County by writ of certiorari.
