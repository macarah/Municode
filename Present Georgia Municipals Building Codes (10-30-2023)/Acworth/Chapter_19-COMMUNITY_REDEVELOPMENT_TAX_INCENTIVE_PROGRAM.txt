Editor's note— Ord. No. 2016-03, adopted Feb. 4, 2016, amended former Ch. 19, §§ 19-1—19-11, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 19 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2014-02, adopted Feb. 6, 2014.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 19-1. - Authority.
In 2002 a majority of the state's electorate, voting in a referendum called for the purpose of ratifying a Constitutional Amendment to the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia, now Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d), confirmed the existence in a community of real property that is maintained in a blighted condition increases the city budget by increasing the need for governmental services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services.
(Ord. No. 2016-03, § 1, 2-4-2016)
Sec. 19-2. - Benefits of rehabilitation of blighted property.
Rehabilitation of blighted improved property decreases the need for such governmental services and allows local governments to better utilize limited revenues available from ad valorem taxation of real property.
(Ord. No. 2016-03, § 1, 2-4-2016)
Sec. 19-3. - Existence of blighted property.
The mayor and board of aldermen have determined the existence of properties within the city that are maintained in blighted condition and have enacted various ordinances intended to combat the existence of slum and blight and prevent its spread to properties in other areas of the city, including the designation of redevelopment areas, pursuant to Chapter 61 of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, however, the cost of current and previous efforts has outpaced the ability of the city to fund blight redevelopment from current revenue sources.
(Ord. No. 2016-03, § 1, 2-4-2016)
Sec. 19-4. - Program established.
The mayor and board hereby establishes a community redevelopment tax incentive program, in accordance with the authority found at Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia, as follows.
Secs. 19-5—19-19. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - PURPOSE

Sec. 19-20. - Increased costs due to existence of blighted property.
The existence of real property that is maintained in a blighted condition increases the costs to city budgets by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services.
(Ord. No. 2016-03, § 1, 2-4-2016)
Sec. 19-21. - Designation of blighted areas.
In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, this mayor and board of aldermen in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations in Chapter 61, Urban Redevelopment, of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread.
(Ord. No. 2016-03, § 1, 2-4-2016)
Sec. 19-22. - Community redevelopment tax program established.
In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.
