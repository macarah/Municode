Such continuance can be granted only by the municipal judge and only after justifiable cause has been shown. At the third term of court if the accused is not present when the case is called, bond will be called and the court clerk will prepare a writ, which will be delivered in person or forwarded by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the bondsman, a copy being mailed to the accused by regular mail. This writ advises the bondsman to appear at the second term of court from the term during which the bond was called and show sufficient cause why the bond should not be forfeited and the order made absolute for the sum specified in the bond.
(b)
Upon the failure of the accused or the bondsman to appear to show acceptable cause, the bond shall be forfeited, the order shall become absolute and the municipal judge shall document the writ.

The warrant will then be given to the city's legal department for processing and filing.
