(Ord. No. 2003-06, § 1, 4-6-2003)
Sec. 18-40. - Site retaining walls.
(a)
Permitting. Retaining walls which do not exceed four feet in vertical height, as measured from the low side exposed toe of the wall to the top of the wall at any point, shall not require permitting provided that the slope of the backfill materials does not exceed 1 in 3 (one foot rise for every three feet of run). In addition, such walls must not support soils, which in turn will support any portion of any structure (except for detached utility structures of 120 square feet or less).
Retaining walls, which exceed four feet in height at any point along the wall, shall require permitting.
All retaining walls, regardless of height, which support soils that are in turn supporting any portion of a structure, other than detached utility structures of 120 square feet of less, shall require building permits.
All walls designed for water retention as part of a stormwater management plan, shall be under the jurisdiction of the Acworth Public Works Department.
(b)
Design. All retaining walls supporting soils that are in turn supporting any portion of a structure, other than detached utility structures of 120 square feet of less, shall require a stamped, sealed design by a Georgia Registered Engineer.
All walls supporting backfill materials sloping in excess of 1 in 3 (one foot rise for every three feet of run), shall require a stamped, sealed design by a Georgia Registered Engineer.
Other walls may be constructed in accordance with the building department's approved standard details, kept on file, or they shall require a stamped, sealed design by a Georgia Registered Engineer.
(c)
Materials. No wood materials may be used in retaining walls with the exception that pressure preservatively treated wood (suitable for continual ground contact use), may be used in walls four feet or less in height; provided that they do not support soils that are in turn supporting any portion of a structure (other than detached utility structures of 120 square feet of less) nor support backfill materials sloping in excess of 1 in 3 (one foot rise for every three feet of run).
(d)
Locations. Regardless of their height, retaining walls must always be located away from other retaining walls a distance of 1.5 times their maximum height (as measured from the low side exposed toe of the wall to the top of the wall at any point). Otherwise they shall require a stamped, sealed design by a Georgia Registered Engineer taking into account the loading imposed by such adjacent walls.
All retaining walls and their required components (including "dead men", geo-textile materials, drain piping, etc.) shall be located entirely on a single parcel of land and shall not cross over any property lines. Exception: Retaining walls located to the rear of buildings or residences may cross over property lines provided that such a crossing is roughly perpendicular to the property line, which it crosses. In such cases, separate permits will be required for each parcel of land on which the wall is to be constructed. Such walls do not need to be broken at the property line, but may be continuous. Such walls shall never support soils that are in turn supporting any portion of a structure, other than detached utility structures of 120 square feet of less.
No retaining walls shall cross creeks, drainage easements, or other water courses without the approval of the Acworth Public Works Department.
All walls designed for water retention, as part of a stormwater management plan, shall be under the jurisdiction of the Acworth Public Works Department.
(e)
Inspections. Inspection of permitted retaining walls shall occur before any concrete, backfill material, drainage material, etc. is placed in such a way as to conceal any other required components of the wall (such as "dead men", geo-textile fabric, drain piping, etc.). This will necessitate at least several inspections, in progressive stages, as the construction of the wall proceeds. At the discretion of the building department, a qualified third party may perform such inspections provided that a letter, signed and sealed by a Georgia Registered Engineer and certifying compliance with all applicable codes and designs, is submitted to the department after the completion of the wall.
(f)
Permit fees. Permit fees shall be calculated the same as for buildings within their appropriate class of construction, either residential or commercial.

In such case that the state requires a contractor to have obtained a state license before he is permitted to perform work, the contractor shall supply the local government with its license number before receiving a permit for work to be performed.
(f)
Conditions of the permit.
(1)
Permit intent. A permit issued is construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes. All permits expire six months after the last required inspection that has been passed, or six months after the date of issue if no required inspections have been approved. The building official may issue a six-month extension of any permit, for due cause, if requested in writing by the permit holder prior to such a permit expiring. The extension of any permit may require the payment of a fee.
(2)
Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they are responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official a written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his place, a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed and approved by the building official.
(3)
Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "reviewed for code compliance" or "approved" or similar.

(5)
Building permit valuations. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing systems, etc. appears to be underestimated on the application, the permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations shall include the total cost of the building, electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing, equipment, and other systems, as required to erect and complete the building, dwelling or structure; including design fees, connection to utilities, site work necessary for foundation installation, materials, labor, overhead and profit. If any of the costs involved are discounted due to the use of used materials, or when labor and/or materials have been traded for some other goods or services (in whole or in part), the normal, undiscounted costs shall be used for the purpose of determining the cost (valuation) of construction in order to determine the permit fees.
(h)
