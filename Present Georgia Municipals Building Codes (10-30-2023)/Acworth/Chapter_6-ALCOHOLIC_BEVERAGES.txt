ARTICLE V. - SOCIAL HOSTING

Sec. 6-200. - Scope of article.
Be it hereby enacted by the mayor and the board of aldermen that persons under the age of 21 who are in possession of alcoholic beverages (hereafter designated as underage persons), and adults, including parents and/or legal guardians (hereafter designated as "social hosts") who facilitate such possession by furnishing alcoholic beverages or by providing access to a location and/or gathering where alcohol can be obtained by underage persons, are in violation of the City of Acworth, Georgia, Code of Ordinances.
(Ord. No. 2014-23, § 1, 10-2-2014)
Sec. 6-201. - Intent; purpose.
(a)
The mayor and the board of aldermen finds as follows:
(1)
According to numerous public health research studies, alcohol remains the number one drug of choice among young people in the United States.
(2)
"The Surgeon General's Call to Action To Prevent and Reduce Underage Drinking," which can be found at http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/topics/underagedrinking/calltoaction.pdf., cites a comprehensive body of facts that demonstrate the risks to communities from underage drinking; they include the following:
a.
"Early alcohol consumption by some young people will result in an alcohol use disorder—that is, they will meet diagnostic criteria for either alcohol abuse or dependence." (page 4)
b.
"While adolescents typically drink alcoholic beverages less often than adults, when they do drink alcoholic beverages, adolescents tend to drink more alcoholic beverages at each event than adults." (pages 6—7)
c.
"Annually, about 5,000 people under age 21 die from alcohol-related injuries involving underage drinking." (page 10)
d.
"Underage drinking "can cause alterations in the structure and function of the developing brain, which continues to mature into the mid—to late twenties and may have consequences reaching far beyond adolescence." (page 11)
e.
"Underage drinking "can cause a range of physical consequences, from hangovers to death from alcohol poisoning." (page 11)
The Surgeon General's Report also identifies alcohol as a contributing factor in many activities that place others as well as the underage alcohol user at risk. These activities include physical and sexual assault, risky sexual behavior, loud and unruly behavior, property damage, unintentional injuries, violence, and even death. For example, "about 45 percent of people who die in car crashes involving a drinking driver under the age of 21 are people other than the driver." (page 11)
(b)
Moreover, the mayor and the board of aldermen finds as follows:
(1)
Persons who are less than the age of 21 often possess or consume alcoholic beverages at social parties or gatherings held at or on private residences and other private property under control of a person who either has provided the alcoholic beverages or who knows or reasonably should know of such conduct, but fails to take steps to prevent it.
(2)
Law enforcement agency responses to disturbances involving underage consumption of alcoholic beverages at parties or gatherings at or on private residences or other private property frequently require the use of extensive public resources.
(3)
Further, when law enforcement personnel respond to such disturbances it limits their ability to respond to other service calls in the community, thereby placing the community at increased risk. Law enforcement is not currently reimbursed for their expenses when called to a party or gathering at or on a private residence or other private property.
(c)
As such, the mayor and the board of aldermen declare as follows:
(1)
Protecting health and safety in the city is a reasonable cause to deter the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons under the age of 21. It is also reasonable and prudent to do by holding responsible persons who encourage, are aware of, or should be aware of, the illegal conduct, yet fail to take steps to prevent it.
(2)
Further, there is data to demonstrate that public efforts to deter the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons under the age of 21 will result in significant costs savings with regard to law enforcement (citation and prosecution), healthcare (i.e., emergency room treatment)) and rehabilitation (addiction and recovery). As such, the revenue received by the city, after cost reimbursement to responding law enforcement agencies, will be directed toward law enforcement strategies and prevention programs in the city.
