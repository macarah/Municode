(B)
Extension and alteration. A nonconforming use shall not be extended or structurally altered, but the extension of a lawful nonconforming use throughout all portions of a building or structure existing at the effective date of this chapter shall not be considered as the extension of a nonconforming use.

If such damage is less than 75 percent of its market value before said damage occurred, exclusive of the foundation, then such structure may be restored to the same nonconforming use as existed before such damage; provided however, that a building permit to initiate restoration be obtained within 12 months of the occurrence of damage; otherwise all provisions of this chapter will apply.
