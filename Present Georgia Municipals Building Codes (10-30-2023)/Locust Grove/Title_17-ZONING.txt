17.04.030 - Wetland protection standards.
A.
Findings of Fact. The wetlands within the city of Locust Grove, Georgia are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state of Georgia.
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
It is, therefore, necessary for the city of Locust Grove, Georgia to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands.
B.
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this section is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.
C.
Wetland Protection District. This section shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the city of Locust Grove, Georgia. The U.S. Department of the Interior, National Wetland Inventory Maps (NWI Maps), adopted as part of this section, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The NWI Maps, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. The NWI Maps shall be on file in the office of the Henry County planning and development department.
D.
Wetland Protection District Boundaries. The NWI Maps are general reference documents, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the NWI Maps is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The NWI Maps do not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city of Locust Grove and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
E.
Buffer Requirements. A natural or enhanced vegetative buffer shall be maintained for a distance of twenty-five feet along the wetland as measured from the delineated boundary to provide an area of protection between the wetland and all permissible uses.
F.
Relationship to Zoning. The wetland protection district is hereby established. The wetland protection district shall comprise an overlay zone that supplements and is indicated on the Official City of Locust Grove Zoning Map.
G.
Issuance of Permits. No local permit should be issued on a project that appears to contain wetlands until a determination has been made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on whether jurisdictional wetlands exist on the site. If there are jurisdictional wetlands on the site that will be disturbed by the proposed development, the applicant must first obtain wetlands alteration Section 404 Permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Findings and Purpose.
1.
Findings of Fact. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city of Locust Grove, Georgia (hereinafter referred to as "city") and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
2.
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed.

3.
Application to Projects Partially Complete. For any development which has received, before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, either preliminary plat approval, site plan approval, building permit or other relevant permits provided by the county and for which substantial work has been completed or substantial investment made in reliance upon such a permit, any future work included in said plat or plan may be completed without being subject to the additional regulations imposed in this section. Any significant additions, expansions, or phases that deviate significantly from said plat or plan or that have not yet received a permit shall be subject to the provisions of this section.
I.
Preexisting Conditions. All parcels of land within the watershed districts that do not conform to the space requirements or come within the permitted uses or the minimum standards hereinafter set out shall be governed by the City Zoning Ordinance as it relates to nonconforming use activities. No property owner within said district or area, nor successors in title, who is engaged in a use which is rendered nonconforming by this section, shall be required to limit, restrict, amortize, or discontinue such use within the boundaries of his property. Nothing in this section shall require any change in development or proposed use of properties which are presently under development or preliminary plat has been submitted and approved as of the effective date of this section. All parcels of tracts of land within said district or area shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the Henry County health department.
J.
Variances.
1.
When Issued. The city may authorize upon appeal in individual cases, such variances from the terms of this section as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this section will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this section shall be observed. Such variance may be granted in such individual cases of practical difficulty or hardship only upon a finding by the city that a majority of the following conditions apply:
a.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography;
b.
The application of this section to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship;
c.
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the water quality of the watershed district or impair the purposes and intent of this section;
d.
The special circumstances surrounding the request for a variance are not the result of acts by the applicant;
e.
The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings or structures which is not permissible in the district involved; and,
f.
The variance will not result in an increase of the impervious surface of the development beyond that prescribed according to subsection G.
2.
Conditions. The city may, as a condition of variances to certain provisions of this section, require alternative measures to be taken by the applicant such that the purpose of this chapter may be achieved through alternative means.
3.
Stormwater Treatment. To the extent any project or development receives a variance under the requirements of this section, the preparation of a stormwater best management practices plan (BMP plan) and treatment of stormwater may be required.
If it is determined by the city that the proposed variance or the development may result in the degradation of water quality, a stormwater best management practices (BMP's) plan will be required. The BMP plan shall be prepared by a professional engineer and shall be designed to provide water quality treatment for the first inch of water runoff from all proposed impervious areas disturbed by the proposed project. This plan must be approved by the city, and the Henry County water and sewerage authority prior to approval of the request for variance. The BMP plan shall be included in and made a part of the stormwater management report (SWMR) that is required under all other applicable ordinances of this city.
Elements of the BMP plan may include but are not limited to:
a.
Check Dams. Dams constructed across a drainage swale or ditch to minimize erosion by reducing stormwater velocity.
b.
Energy Dissipation Devices. Paved or riprapped channel sections placed below storm drain outlets to reduce flow velocity.
c.
Water Quality Inlets. Specially constructed stormwater inlets designed to remove sediment, debris, oils, and greases from stormwater.
d.
Such other water treatment facilities that are deemed necessary to treat the runoff water before said water enters the streams of the drainage district.
e.
Buffer Zones. Strips of undisturbed, original land or vegetation surrounding the land-disturbed site to reduce stormwater velocities and filter pollutants.
f.
Grass Swales and Filter Strips. Vegetative drainage conveyances, used in lieu of storm drains, designed to reduce flow rates and provide filtering/infiltration of stormwater.
g.
Dry Detention Ponds. Dry surface storage areas designed to collect and store stormwater runoff and to provide settling of pollutants.
h.
Wet Detention Ponds. Wet storage ponds designed to collect and store stormwater runoff and to provide settling of pollutants.
i.
Wetland Plantings. Areas designed to collect, store, and treat stormwater runoff using appropriate wetland vegetation.
The SWMR and the BMP plan shall be submitted to the city and Henry County water and sewerage authority ("authority") for its review. The authority's report shall determine whether or not the SWMR and the BMP plan meet the requirements of this section. No development or building permit shall be issued until the SWMR and the BMP plan has been approved by the city. If, during the course of the development the city finds that the developer is in violation of the SWMR or the BMP plan, the city issue a stop work order. Upon the issuance of the stop work order, all development and construction on the project shall immediately cease until the developer is in full compliance with the terms of this section.
K.
Appeals. Decisions made by the enforcer may be appealed to the city council. Notice of the appeal must be filed with the city within ten days of the decision rendered by the enforcer. The notice of appeal shall contain a written statement specifying the errors made by the enforcer and the specific relief requested by the party appealing. A public hearing will be conducted by the mayor and city council at either a regular or special called meeting of the mayor and city council. Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given to the party appealing at least three days prior to the date of the hearing.
L.
Amendments. These regulations and the watershed district map may from time to time be amended in accordance with procedures and requirements in the general statutes.
M.
Assessment Relief. Assessors and boards of assessors shall consider the requirements of these regulations in determining the fair market value of land.
N.
Separability and Abrogation. All sections and subsections of the ordinance codified in this section are considered separate and distinct. Should any section, subsection, paragraph or part of this section be declared by a court of jurisdiction to be invalid for any reason, it shall not invalidate any other section, subsection, paragraph or part of this section.

4.
In the event of a conflict between this ordinance and any other ordinance or development agreement provision, the terms of this ordinance shall control.
5.

17.04.070 - Conservation residential subdivision district (CRS).
A.
Purpose. The purpose of the conservation residential subdivision district (CRS) is to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the current and future inhabitants of the City of Locust Grove by allowing flexibility in the design of certain subdivision from standard regulations to support permanent protection of green space. The specific purposes of the CRS include:
1.
To provide single-family residential subdivisions which permit flexibility of design in order to preserve environmentally-sensitive areas and create efficient uses of land.
2.
To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplain, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands, wildlife habitats, historic features and unique topography.
3.
To permit clustering of dwellings and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces, utilities, earthwork and other land disturbing activities necessary for residential development.
4.
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential developments.
5.
To conserve a portion of the otherwise developable property as green space in perpetuity. This option is not necessarily intended to allow an applicant to conserve only the portion of the tract that is already unbuildable due to factors such as steep slopes, wetlands, or land adjacent to undesirable areas such as landfills or livestock farming.
6.
To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the City of Locust Grove.
7.
To promote linking of greenways and corridors between the City of Locust Grove and neighboring jurisdictions.
8.
To encourage interactions of persons living in the resulting residential community by clustering dwellings and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
9
To encourage street designs that reduces traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries.
10.
To incorporate aesthetic design standards that will increase the value of the neighborhood.
11.
To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by promoting views of green space, from within the development and from arterial and collector roads.
12.
To preserve important historical and archaeological sites.
13.
To promote other purposes of the zoning ordinance, subdivision regulations, soil erosion and sediment control ordinance and other ordinances and policies of the City of Locust Grove.
B.
Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the meaning prescribed, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
"Conservation easement" means a nonpossessory interest of a holder in real property imposing limitations of affirmative obligations for the purposes of which include retaining or protecting natural, scenic, green, or open areas of real property, assuring its availability for agricultural, forest, recreational, or green space use, protecting natural resources, maintaining or enhancing air or water quality, or preserving the historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural aspects of real property.
"Conservation residential subdivision (CRS)" means a single-family residential subdivision design which concentrates lots, dwellings, streets, utilities and related development activities on the more suitable and less environmentally-sensitive areas of the site, thereby preserving the steep slopes, wetlands, unsuitable soils, stream corridors and other areas in a natural or undisturbed state. A CRS allows for slightly higher net density than that typically allowed for the underlying zoning classification of the property, and smaller lots sizes in order to preserve environmentally sensitive areas in dedicated, perpetual green space.
"Density bonus" is the amount of additional density applicable to a type of development in the CRS district according to the quality construction standards established herein.
"Green space" means an area of land within the subdivision boundary whish shall remain in a permanent undeveloped condition except for amenity areas. The ownership, uses, limitations of use and maintenance of such land shall be determined through a written management plan to be approved by the City of Locust Grove at or before approval of the final plat for property approved for this district. The green space shall include net usable acreage and should include non-usable acreage within the gross acreage of the subdivision.
"Holder" means a governmental body empowered to hold an interest in real property under the laws of the State of Georgia or the United States; or a charitable corporation, charitable association, or charitable trust, the purposes or powers of which include retaining or protecting the natural, scenic, or green space values of real property, assuring the availability of real property for agricultural, forestry, recreational, or green space use, protecting natural resources, maintaining or enhancing air or water quality, or preserving the historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural aspects of real property.
"Master development plan" is a site plan that depicts the proposed subdivision layout including lot dimensions, rights-of-way (street) layout, parking facilities, sidewalks, multiuse paths, stormwater detention/retention facilities, green space area including any physiographic characteristics, buffers, and amenities. The master development plan shall also provide the amount of land in the one hundred-year floodplain, rights-of-way, stormwater detention/retention ponds, nonresidential lands, public lands, net usable area and amount of green space. Furthermore, the master development plan shall state the proposed density; quality construction standards to be met and the corresponding density bonuses to be applied, if any; percentage of impervious surfaces; and any other information required by the city.
"Net usable area (nua)" means the area of land on which dwellings may be constructed but exclusive of streets; rights-of-way, one hundred-year floodplain or flood hazard areas; stormwater detention/retention ponds; land used solely for commercial, office, institutional, or industrial uses, and public lands. Easements for stormwater, sanitary sewer, or water services shall not be excluded from nua.
"Pocket parks" are parks for passive recreational uses consisting (typically) of one-quarter of an acre to not more than one acre of nua acreage the purpose of which is to provide green space for recreational use within walking distance of most residences, especially those located farthest from amenity areas or access to green space. This allows for a slightly larger pocket park area in terms of more formal elements for consideration during the zoning or preliminary plat process.
"Residential garage" shall mean an enclosed structure attached to or part of the principal dwelling for housing at least two vehicles. All single-family CRS home garages shall have the following minimum dimensions: vehicular entrance height, seven feet; vehicular entrance width, sixteen feet; garage interior height, eight feet four inches; and overall garage width and depth of no less than twenty feet by twenty feet, respectively. The floor shall be constructed of concrete. Concrete floors shall be reinforced, where appropriate, and a minimum of four inches in thickness with appropriate fill and base. Residential garages shall not be enclosed for living space, storage purposes or any other purpose without first obtaining a variance from the city and constructing an attached residential garage to the main residential structure. The residential garage shall be kept clear to that a minimum of one vehicle may be parked in the garage at all times. Garages may be placed in the following arrangements on lots as required herein:
1.
For lots with alleyway access, garages shall either be placed at the rear of the structure or have the garage door at the rear of the main structure.
2.
For lots without alleyway access, garages may be located with front-entry facing residential streets; side-entry, with garage entry located at the side of a residential structure; or plaza entry, with garage structure in the front of the main residential structure having its garage entry placed to the side.
"Standard subdivision" means the form of subdivision design where all land areas within the development are typically divided into building lots and rights-of-way with little or no green space is set aside.
"Third party right of enforcement" means the right provided in a conservation easement to enforce any of its terms granted to a governmental body, charitable corporation, charitable association, or charitable trust, which, although eligible to the a holder, is not a holder.
C.
Permitted Locations for the CRS District. The CRS district shall be applied any single-family zoning district (RA, R-1, R-2, R-3) as approved through rezoning by the city council. All properties must have access to an arterial or collector street; however, a CRS may gain access to a local street where approved by city council according to the master development plan and any required traffic impact analysis on such streets. All CRS subdivisions must have access to public water and sewer.

F.
Housing Density Determination. The maximum number of lots in the conservation residential subdivision shall be determined by a yield plan plus any applicable quality construction bonus density provided herein. A yield plan shall depict the maximum number of lots that is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by a registered landscape architect, engineer, or land surveyor of the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible in the underlying zoning district. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations.
G.
Development Standards. Applications for the CRS shall be processed in the same manner as an application for a zoning map amendment. CRS plats shall be processed in the same manner as a standard subdivision plat, with exception of a formal review and approval of a preliminary subdivision plat by city council.

a.
Existing vegetation shall be of sufficient depth and foliage to provide a visual opaque buffer at a minimum height of six feet from prevailing grade throughout the length of the required undisturbed buffer area. Where such vegetation does not exist, or, where there exists a greater need for a structural buffer (landscaped earthen berm or masonry wall), either additional plantings, or a structural buffer shall be installed under the approval of the council and mayor as part of preliminary plat approval. Use of a structural buffer may allow the reduction of the required buffer width to no less than forty feet at the discretion of the council and mayor.
b.
Buffer shall not be included in the lot area required for a CRS subdivision.
4.
Along each side of a perennial stream a one hundred-foot undisturbed buffer is required.

(Ord. 04-07-047 § 2)
17.04.090 - Residential growth regulation.
A.
Purpose and Intent. In addition to the following statements, the preamble of this section is incorporated herein by reference. The Atlanta Regional Commission ("ARC") 2003 Population and Housing Report identifies Henry County as the fastest growing county in the metro-Atlanta Region overseen by ARC. Henry County has grown at a rate of seven percent per year between the years 2000 and 2003. Atlanta's burgeoning southeastern population growth follows the path of U.S. Interstate 75 ("I-75") through Henry County. The city of Locust Grove ("City") is located in Henry County on I-75. Although the city sits on the boundary of the ARC planning region, it has experienced and is expected to continue to experience increased residential growth.
According to such report, single-family housing has continued to dominate the market over the past three years while multifamily housing developments have increased at significant rates in particular areas. Areas where multifamily development continues to grow is where land is located outside the perimeter of U.S. Interstate 285 ("I-285") and in close proximity and with good accessibility to interstates and highways. The city is located outside the I-285 perimeter and is bisected by I-75 and Georgia State Highway 42.
As indicated in ARC's report, multifamily growth is occurring in the city at a rapid rate. The report correctly states that as of the close of 2003, the city's housing stock consisted of approximately seventy percent single-family housing with the remainder in the form of mobilehomes. These percentages, however, do not reflect the approximately one thousand multifamily units to be developed as a result of rezonings approved in 2003.
To address these growth trends, the mayor and city council wish to take proactive steps to accommodate and control the amount of single-family housing, multifamily housing and mobilehome development within its boundaries. Thus, it is the intention of the mayor and city council and purpose of this section to encourage continued diversification of residential uses in the city as well as accommodate its fair share of the region's residential growth in a manner consistent with both the remote proximity of the city to the center of regional growth and the history of residential land uses developed in the city.
B.
Residential Growth Limitation.
1.
Within the city of Locust Grove, single-family housing, which consists of single-family detached homes under an RA, R-1, R-2, or R-3 zoning classification shall not be less than seventy-seven percent of the city housing stock. Multifamily housing, which consists of the RM classification regulating apartments (RM-1), townhouses (RM-2), and condominiums (RM-3) and the RD zoning classification regulating duplexes, shall not be more than twenty percent of the city housing stock. Mobilehomes, which are built under the RMH or grandfathered RM-75 zoning classifications, shall not be more than three percent of the city housing stock.
2.
Within the category of single-family housing as described in subsection (B)(1) of this section, homes built under an R-3 zoning classification shall not exceed thirty percent of the overall single-family housing stock for the city; and the remainder of the single-family housing stock developed under an RA, R-1, R-2 zoning classification shall not be less than forty-seven percent of the overall single-family housing stock in the city.
C.
Administration.
1.
Residential Housing Inventory. For purposes of determining whether or not a proposed development in the city will violate the residential growth limitations set forth in this section, the city manager or his or her designee, in coordination with the planning and zoning department of Henry County, shall determine the residential housing inventory for the city. The residential housing inventory shall be based on the total number of housing units that could be built on land zoned for residential use and in accordance with the particular zoning district regulations applicable to such land. The residential housing inventory shall then be converted into percentages of single-family, multifamily and mobilehomes for determination of compliance with the residential growth limitations set forth in subsection (B)(1) of this section. Furthermore, the residential housing inventory for all single-family uses shall be subdivided into percentages of high density single-family and low to medium density single-family use to determine compliance with the residential growth limitations set forth in subsection (B)(2) of this section.
2.
Quarterly Residential Growth Report. The city manager, or his designee, shall document all information required under subsection (C)(1) of this section in a quarterly residential growth report, and such report shall be presented to the city council at the first meeting of the council for each quarter. Thereafter, the city manager, or his designee, shall submit such report to the Henry County planning and zoning director. The quarterly residential growth report and this section shall be considered by the municipal planning commission and the city council whenever they must respectively recommend or decide any amendment to the zoning ordinance, including the zoning map, use variance, and any development agreements entered into for residential development of property in the city. The quarterly residential growth report shall be available to the public at the city clerk's office.
3.
No proposed rezoning of property for residential use shall be approved unless the potential or actual housing yield for the property will not violate the residential growth limitations set forth in subsection B of this section, unless the developer agrees to cap the number of units to a level which would not violate this section.
4.
At least once every ten years after adoption of the ordinance codified in this section, the mayor and city council shall reconsider, and adjust if necessary, the residential growth limitations set forth in subsection B of this section in light of regional and local growth trends and residential uses.
5.
This section shall not be construed, in any way, to limit the city's authority to annex property in accordance with the laws of the state of Georgia.
D.
Variances. Each quarter, the city council shall have the authority to grant variances for up to a maximum of one hundred residential units in excess of the residential growth limitations set forth in subsection B of this section upon a showing of undue hardship in accordance with the criteria set forth under Section 3-7-273 of the Henry County zoning ordinance as adopted and amended by the city. No administrative variances to this section shall be granted.
E.
Appeal.
1.
Any person may appeal a quarterly residential growth report within ten calendar days of its presentation to the city council. Such an appeal shall be submitted to the city manager and shall explain the basis for the appeal in writing. Appeals of quarterly residential growth reports shall be heard by the city council at its next regularly scheduled meeting, and a decision shall be made by the city council no later than at the next regularly scheduled council meeting after hearing an appeal.
2.
A decision by the city council made pursuant to this section may be appealed by writ of certiorari to Superior Court of Henry County, Georgia, in accordance with the laws of the state of Georgia.
3.
Any finding of or penalty imposed by the municipal court of the city pursuant to this section may be appealed by writ of certiorari to Superior Court of Henry County, Georgia, in accordance with the laws of the state of Georgia.
F.
Penalty. A violation of this residential growth limitation set forth in subsection B of this section shall result a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars and/or imprisonment not to exceed thirty days or a combination thereof after a cited person, persons or entity is found guilty or such person, persons or entity pleads guilty or nolo contendere. Such violations shall be assessed on a per dwelling unit per day basis. Each violation shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such.

17.04.100 - Buffer requirements.
Sections 3-7-191 through 3-7-194, as adopted by Henry County, is repealed by the city of Locust Grove. Section 3-7-192, as adopted by Henry County, is repealed by the city of Locust Grove and replaced with the following:
A.
The purposes of the buffer requirements set forth below are to minimize the adverse impacts of adjacent incompatible uses, to improve the aesthetics of developments in the city, to provide for green space corridors in the city, to preserve the rural feel of the city, and to calm traffic.
B.
The requirements for planted buffers are as follows:
1.
For all residential subdivisions (including multifamily and mobilehome developments) and industrial land uses, the minimum width of the required vegetative or planted buffer shall be one hundred feet along any existing public street and fifty feet along the perimeter of the property. If the property is wooded and the timber has not been cut in the past five years, the above required buffers shall remain undisturbed. If timber on the property has been cut within the last five years or if the property is partially wooded and partially open or entirely open, the above required buffers in the wooded area shall be undisturbed and buffers in open or timbered areas shall be enhanced with a planted vegetative buffer. Such vegetative buffer shall consist of a minimum of four rows of trees planted with twenty foot separation between trees staggered so as to provide vegetative screen. Three quarters of the trees must be overstory trees with the remainder consisting of understory trees as defined, listed and of a minimum size as prescribed in the city landscaping ordinance. Existing trees in the buffer area shall be incorporated into the planted vegetative buffer.
2.
For all commercial and office/institutional land uses, the minimum width of the required vegetative or planted buffer shall be fifty feet along any public street and fifty feet along the perimeter of the land. However, where the land use on the adjoining property is commercial or office/institutional, the buffer area may be reduced so that total buffer area between the adjoining properties is no less than fifty feet. The buffer areas shall consist of sod, shrubs, understory trees and overstory trees as required in the city landscaping ordinance. In addition, one row of overstory trees shall be planted with no greater than fifty feet of separation between trees in accordance with the types and minimum sizes recommended in the city landscaping ordinance. Such buffers shall be maintained by the property owners.
3.
The buffers required herein shall be permanent and shall not be disturbed or reduced in any way, except for vehicular and pedestrian (including bicycle) connectivity, ground signs, and utility installation and maintenance.
C.
With respect to residential uses, except for conservation residential subdivisions, the required planted buffer may be incorporated into the yard setbacks as specified in the applicable residential zoning district. If the required planted buffer is not incorporated into the yard setback as specified in the applicable zoning district, the required planted buffer area shall be conveyed to a homeowners' association, which shall be responsible for the maintenance of such area, and the required buffer area may be counted towards the open space requirements for such district.
D.
In some instances, the city may require a masonry wall, decorative fencing, or a planted berm, each no less than six feet in height, as part of the buffer requirement. If any of such structures are required, the buffer area in which such structures are required may be reduced in width as deemed appropriate by the planning director but by no more than twenty feet.
E.
Buffers within the downtown development district shall be set by the city council after consultation with the city manager and/or downtown development authority, as the city council deems appropriate. The amount and type of buffer for properties within the downtown development district shall be determined on a case by case basis based on the existing and anticipated uses of adjacent properties and in a manner consistent with similarly situated uses within such district.

17.04.160 - Conservation residential subdivision overlay district (CRSO).
A.
Purpose. The purpose of the conservation residential subdivision overlay district (CRSO) is to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the current and future inhabitants of the city by allowing flexibility in the design of certain subdivision from standard regulations to support permanent protection of green space.
The specific purposes of the CRSO include:
1.
To provide single-family residential subdivisions which permit flexibility of design in order to preserve environmentally-sensitive areas and create efficient uses of land.
2.
To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplain, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands, wildlife habitats, historic features and unique topography.
3.
To permit clustering of dwellings and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces, utilities, earthwork and other land disturbing activities necessary for residential development.
4.
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential developments.
5.
To conserve a portion of the otherwise developable property as green space in perpetuity. This option is not necessarily intended to allow an applicant to conserve only the portion of the tract that is already unbuildable due to factors such as steep slopes, wetlands, or land adjacent to undesirable areas such as landfills or livestock farming.
6.
To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the city.
7.
To promote linking of greenways and corridors between the city and neighboring jurisdictions.
8.
To encourage interactions of persons living in the resulting residential community by clustering dwellings and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
9.
To encourage street designs that reduces traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries.
10.
To incorporate aesthetic design standards that will increase the value of the neighborhood.
11.
To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by promoting views of green space, from within the development and from arterial and collector roads.
12.
To preserve important historical and archaeological sites.
13.
To promote other purposes of the zoning ordinance, subdivision regulations, soil erosion and sediment control ordinance and other ordinances and policies of the city.
B.
Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the meaning prescribed, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
"Conservation easement" means a nonpossessory interest of a holder in real property imposing limitations of affirmative obligations for the purposes of which include retaining or protecting natural, scenic, green, or open areas of real property, assuring its availability for agricultural, forest, recreational, or green space use, protecting natural resources, maintaining or enhancing air or water quality, or preserving the historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural aspects of real property.
"Conservation residential subdivision overlay (CRSO)" means a single-family residential subdivision design which concentrates lots, dwellings, streets, utilities and related development activities on the more suitable and less environmentally sensitive areas of the site, thereby preserving the steep slopes, wetlands, unsuitable soils, stream corridors and other areas in a natural or undisturbed state. A CRSO allows for slightly higher net density than that typically allowed for the underlying zoning classification of the property, and smaller lots sizes in order to preserve environmentally-sensitive areas in dedicated, perpetual green space.
"Density bonus" is the amount of additional density applicable to a type of development in the CRSO district according to the quality construction standards established herein.
"Green space" means an area of land within the subdivision boundary whish shall remain in a permanent undeveloped condition except for amenity areas. The ownership, uses, limitations of use and maintenance of such land shall be determined through a written management plan to be approved by the city at or before approval of the final plat for property approved for this district. The green space shall include net usable acreage and should include non-usable acreage within the gross acreage of the subdivision.
"Holder" means a governmental body empowered to hold an interest in real property under the laws of the State of Georgia or the United States; or a charitable corporation, charitable association, or charitable trust, the purposes or powers of which include retaining or protecting the natural, scenic, or green space values of real property, assuring the availability of real property for agricultural, forestry, recreational, or green space use, protecting natural resources, maintaining or enhancing air or water quality, or preserving the historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural aspects of real property.
"Master development plan" is a site plan that depicts the proposed subdivision layout including lot dimensions, rights-of-way (street) layout, parking facilities, sidewalks, multiuse paths, stormwater detention/retention facilities, green space area including any physiographic characteristics, buffers, and amenities. The master development plan shall also provide the amount of land in one hundred-year floodplain, rights-of-way, stormwater detention/retention ponds, nonresidential lands, public lands, net usable area and amount of green space. Furthermore, the master development plan shall state the proposed density; quality construction standards to be met and the corresponding density bonuses to be applied, if any; percentage of impervious surfaces; and any other information required by the city.
"Net usable area (nua)" mean the area of land on which dwellings may be constructed but exclusive of streets; rights-of-way; one hundred-year floodplain or flood hazard areas; stormwater detention/retention ponds; land used solely for commercial, office, institutional, or industrial uses, and public lands. Easements for stormwater, sanitary sewer, or water services shall not be excluded from nua.
"Pocket parks" are parks for passive recreational uses consisting (typically) of one-quarter of an acre to not more than one acre of nua acreage the purpose of which is to provide green space for recreational use within walking distance of most residences, especially those located farthest from amenity areas or access to green space. This allows for a slightly larger pocket park area in terms of more formal elements for consideration during the zoning or preliminary plat process.
"Residential garage" shall mean an enclosed structure attached to or part of the principal dwelling for housing at least two vehicles. All single-family CRSO home garages shall have the following minimum dimensions: vehicular entrance height, seven fee; vehicular entrance width, sixteen feet; garage interior height, eight feet four inches; and overall garage width and depth of no less than twenty feet by twenty feet, respectively. The floor shall be constructed of concrete. Concrete floors shall be reinforced, where appropriate, and a minimum of four inches in thickness with appropriate fill and base. Residential garages shall not be enclosed for living space, storage purposes or any other purpose without first obtaining a variance from the city and constructing an attached residential garage to the main residential structure. The residential garage shall be kept clear to that a minimum of one vehicle may be parked in the garage at all times. Garages may be placed in the following arrangements on lots as required herein:
1.
For lots with alleyway access, garages shall either be placed at the rear of the structure or have the garage door at the rear of the main structure.
2.
For lots without alleyway access, garages may be located with front-entry facing residential streets; side-entry, with garage entry located at the side of a residential structure; or plaza entry, with garage structure in the front of the main residential structure having its garage entry placed to the side.
"Standard subdivision" means the form of subdivision design where all land areas within the development are typically divided into building lots and rights-of-way with little or no green space is set aside.
"Third party right of enforcement" means the right provided in a conservation easement to enforce any of its terms granted to a governmental body, charitable corporation, charitable association, or charitable trust, which, although eligible to a holder, is not a holder.
C.
Permitted Locations for the CRSO District. The CRSO district shall be applied any single-family zoning district (RA, R-1, R-2, R-3) as approved through rezoning by the city council. All properties must have access to an arterial or collector street; however, a CRSO may gain access to a local street where approved by city council according to the master development plan and any required traffic impact analysis on such streets. All CRSO subdivisions must have access to public water and sewer.

The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations.
G.
Development Standards. Applications for the CRSO shall be processed in the same manner as an application for a zoning map amendment. CRSO plats shall be processed in the same manner as a standard subdivision plat, with exception of a formal review and approval of a preliminary subdivision plat by city council. All approved preliminary and final plats shall have an additional marking of "CRSO", symbolizing the use of conservation residential subdivision overlay development standards. The minimum development standards that must be met by a CRSO are as follows:
1.
A minimum of twenty-five percent of the total acreage shall be permanently protected as described elsewhere in this section. Of this required green space total, at least twenty-five percent of that amount shall consist of net usable acreage.

3.
Unless otherwise provided for below, a seventy-five-foot undisturbed buffer shall be maintained along all exterior streets and a twenty-five-foot undisturbed buffer along the perimeter of the property shall be maintained.
a.
Existing vegetation shall be of sufficient depth and foliage to provide a visual opaque buffer at a minimum height of six feet from prevailing grade throughout the length of the required undisturbed buffer area. Where such vegetation does not exist, or, where there exists a greater need for a structural buffer (landscaped earthen berm or masonry wall), either additional plantings, or a structural buffer shall be installed under the approval of the council and mayor as part of preliminary plat approval. Use of a structural buffer may allow the reduction of the required buffer width to no less than forty feet at the discretion of the council and mayor.
b.
Buffer shall not be included in the lot area required for a CRSO subdivision.
4.
Along each side of a perennial stream a one hundred-foot undisturbed buffer is required.

Where use of the TND option is proposed, minimum home size may be reduced by no more than ten percent upon approval by the council and mayor.
13.
Alleyways are required for all interior lots of a CRSO where practical. For lots along the perimeter of the development, either alleyways or an alternative parking arrangement must be provided. Alternative parking arrangements may consist either of on-street parking a minimum of ten feet in width by twenty feet in length with tree islands every twelve spaces; off-street parking lots developed to commercial standards with minimum size of nine feet in width by eighteen feet in length; or use of an additional ten feet of front setback for additional storage of vehicles on individual lots. For lots seventy-five feet in width or greater, plaza or side-entry garages are required. Where on-street parking is used, it shall be used in conjunction with alleyway lots to prevent conflicts with driveway cuts. All parking should be distributed throughout the development to provide equal access to the lots they are intended to serve. The ratio of alternative parking shall be one space for every three lots, unless otherwise specified by council and mayor. All parking arrangements shall be reviewed with submission for the CRSO and must be approved by city council as part of approval of the preliminary plat.

Article II - Appeals and Variances

17.04.271 - Appeals.
A.
When it is alleged that an error has been made in interpretation of the provisions of this chapter or when a decision relating to provisions of this chapter aggrieves any person an appeal shall be made within thirty days of the decision.
B.
Such appeal shall be filed with the community development department director and the purpose of the appeal shall be specified in writing.
(Ord. No. 04-07-059, §§ 4, 5, 7-5-05)
17.04.272 - Appeals process.
The city council shall establish a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal and shall give public notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties in interest; and shall decide the appeal within reasonable time. At the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
(Ord. No. 04-07-059, §§ 4, 5, 7-5-05)
17.04.273 - Variances.
The city council is authorized upon appeal in specific cases to consider such variances from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the chapter will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings, or structures in the same or in other districts shall not constitute a reason for a variance. A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the city council that all the following conditions exist:
A.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district.
B.
A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties of the district in which the property is located.
C.
Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located.
D.
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare.
E.
The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant.
F.
The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure.
G.
The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings, or structures which is not permitted by right in the district involved.
(Ord. No. 04-07-059, §§ 4, 5, 7-5-05)
17.04.274 - Variance procedure.
A.
An applicant requesting a variance may submit an application for a hearing before the city council if his/her request meets all of the following conditions:
1.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same zoning district.
2.
A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties within the city or within a similar zoning or overlay district.
3.
Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties within the city or within a similar zoning or overlay district.
4.
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter, the specific zoning of the property and the land use plan and will not be injurious to the general welfare of the community.
5.
The special circumstances or justifications for the variance are not the result of self-imposed actions or misfortunes of the applicant.
6.
The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, building, or structure which is not permitted by right in the overlaying zoning district or scheme of the land use plan.
7.
The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure.
(Ord. No. 04-07-059, §§ 4, 5, 7-5-05)
17.04.275 - Administrative variances.
The community development department director shall have the power to grant variances from the development standards of this chapter where, in his opinion, the intent of the chapter can be achieved and equal performance obtained by granting a variance.

3.
Rear yard: Variance not to exceed four feet.

(Ord. No. 04-07-059, §§ 4, 5, 7-5-05)
17.04.276 - Fees.
All requests by private groups, individuals, businesses and other nonpublic organizations for appeals and variances shall be accompanied by a filing fee which is maintained in the office of the community development department director.
(Ord. No. 04-07-059, §§ 4, 5, 7-5-05)
17.04.277 - Appeals and variances.
A.
The city council shall consider all of the following prior to making a decision:
1.
The report of recommendations submitted by the community development department.
2.
Whether all specific requirements of this chapter relative to consideration of a variance have been met.
3.

The adequacy and availability of public infrastructure (water, sewer, roads, etc.) to serve the request.
6.
Whether the applicant has agreed to any specific conditions that will enhance his/her request and will protect the public interest and assure the continued beneficial use of nearby properties.
7.
Whether the request will further or support the goals and objectives of the land use plan and will not be detrimental to nearby properties and property values.
