Article II. - Pawnbrokers

5.21.200 - Limitation on issuance.
A.
Preliminary Findings.
1.
As a municipality located within the Atlanta Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area which is experiencing rapid growth and change due to urbanization of Henry County and being familiar with the experiences of other urban and suburban counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, the City of Atlanta, Clayton County, DeKalb County, and Fulton County, Georgia, whose experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, the mayor and council take note of the well known and self-evident conditions attendant to the operation of businesses by pawnbrokers, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country.
2.
Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that operation of businesses by pawnbrokers under certain circumstances could lead to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions.
3.
Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the operation of businesses by pawnbrokers, are theft, burglary, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of minors. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with such businesses are actual or perceived depression of property values or acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation in expenditures for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and an increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this section.
4.
Accordingly, it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of businesses operated by pawnbrokers by limiting the proximity of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of such businesses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semipublic uses; to ensure that businesses operated by pawnbrokers do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts.
5.
Therefore, the close proximity of businesses operated by pawnbrokers is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with such activities. To that end, the ordinance codified in this section is adopted.
