16.04.034 - Approval and expiration of preliminary plats, final plats and legal nonconforming lots.
A.
Approval of a preliminary plat does not vest any rights in development of the property nor does it constitute approval of a final plat; it indicates only approval of the layout as a guide to the preparation of the final plat. A preliminary plat must be submitted to and approved by the city council at a public meeting and shall expire and be null and void after a period of one year from the date of approval. Preliminary plat approval is required before submission of a final plat.
B.
If no final plat is submitted to community development department within the time specified in subsection 16.04.034(A) for preliminary plats, the property owner may apply with the community development director for an extension of time. The community development director, without requiring city council approval, is authorized to grant a single extension of the preliminary plat for a maximum period of time of six months. The city council may grant one additional extension not to exceed six months.
C.
Final plats shall be submitted to the community development department for review, comments and, if proper, recommendation for approval to the city council. The applicant shall ensure that the final plat conforms to the city codes. For a final plat to be approved, the city council must review the plat and approve the plat at a public hearing. If the plat does not to meet the city codes at the time of approval, the city council shall disapprove and reject the plat; and a final plat that does not meet the city Code at the time of approval is null and void.
D.
Approved final plats shall be valid for one year. The community development director, without requiring city council approval, is authorized to grant a single extension of the final plat for a maximum period of time of six months. The city council may grant one additional extension not to exceed six months. If the no valid, active and unexpired building permit has been issued for building within the final platted subdivision prior to its expiration, the final plat shall be deemed expired, abandoned and discontinued. In an expired subdivision, those lots on which completed buildings exist at the day of expiration shall be legal nonconforming lots and structures. All other lots in an expired subdivision must thereafter conform to current zoning ordinances, including, but not limited to, including subsection 3-7-122(b) of the Henry County Code concerning Nonconforming Lots of Record which has been adopted into the city Code, and a new final plat shall be required that conforms to the current zoning ordinances of the city before permits for use of such lots may issue.
E.
If action on a preliminary or final plat is not taken within one hundred twenty days of the date of submittal, the plat shall be considered denied. At the request of the applicant and in the discretion of the community development director, however, the director may grant a single extension not to exceed ninety days.
F.
Any and all preliminary plats and final plats approved prior to April 1, 2016 shall expire one year from said date.
G.
Where a lot owner has applied for a nonconforming lot determination prior to the expiration of a final plat, and the city has issued a determination finding legal nonconforming lots, the legal nonconformance determination shall operate as an automatic renewal of the final plat but only as to those specific lots. Such renewal shall be valid for only twenty-four months from the date of the determination unless a valid building permit has been issued prior to plat expiration and the building permit remains active and has not expired. For the duration lots remain legal nonconforming platted lots, development of those lots shall be subject to previous applicable zoning requirements, unless the lot owner commits and specifies in writing to the community development director that it will comply with all or a portion of the current zoning requirements. Because nonconforming lots are not to be perpetuated, no extensions of plat approval for such lots shall be granted. Any and all expired nonconforming lots shall be deemed abandoned and discontinued. Such abandoned and discontinued lots shall be brought into conformance with the city's current zoning ordinances, including subsection 3-7-122(b) of the Henry County Code concerning nonconforming lots of record which has been adopted into the city Code, before any permit for use of such lots may issue.

16.04.071 - Private streets and privatization of public streets.
Acceptance and Abandonment Policy.
A.
Roadway Abandonment—Legal Compliance.
1.
Municipal Streets Belong to the General Public. Since the control and general supervision of municipal streets is conferred upon the city, the city holds those streets in trust for the convenience and use of the public at large. It correspondingly becomes the city's duty to keep them in a safe and suitable condition for the passage of persons and transportation of commodities. The basic principles of law regarding streets are pronounced in at least two cases, Jones, et al. v. City of Moultrie, et al., 196 Ga. 526 (1943); Accord: Soles v. City of Vidalia, 92 Ga. App. 839 (1955):
A highway is a public way open and free to anyone who has occasion to pass along it on foot or with any kind of vehicle. The streets of a city belong to the public, and are primarily for the use of the public in the ordinary way. The primary object of streets is for public passage. They should be kept open and unobstructed for that purpose. The streets of the city are peculiarly within the police control for the purpose of preserving and protecting their use by the public as thoroughfares.
B.
Roadway Abandonment is Governed by O.C.G.A. § 32-7-2(c). When it is determined that a section of the municipal street system has for any reason ceased to be used by the public to the extent that no substantial public purpose is served by it or that its removal from the municipal street system is otherwise in the best public interest, the municipality, by certification recorded in its minutes, accompanied by a plat or sketch, and after notice to property owners located thereon, may declare that section of street shall no longer be a part of the municipal street system and the rights of the public in and to that section of street as a public street shall cease. The property may be disposed of by the municipality as provided in O.C.G.A. § 32-7-4.
1.
Procedure.
a.
Abandonment is defined as the intentional and permanent relinquishment of claim and title to real property that forms a segment of the city's roadway network or was acquired or held for future use as a portion of the roadway network.
b.
Abandonment of a road or right-of-way requires that the city council make a finding of one of the following with respect to the roadway in question:
1.
That no substantial public purpose is served by it; or
2.
That its removal from the municipal street system is in the best public interest.
c.
Requests for abandonment of roads within the city roadway network shall be made to the department of public works by a homeowner association (HOA) or, if no HOA exists, an individual or group of individuals whose property adjoins or is accessed by the public right-of-way being considered for abandonment (referred to herein as "applicant"). The department of public works or the city council may initiate abandonment requests. In the event the department of public works or the city council initiate an abandonment request, only those procedural requirements set forth in pertinent state law shall be observed.
d.
The applicant shall be required to submit documentation establishing the factual basis upon which the request for abandonment is made. The applicant shall be required to provide all necessary information demonstrating compliance with the requirements of this section and all applicable state laws prior to the initial public hearing.
e.
The department of public works will not support the abandonment of any road that connects two or more collector roads without sufficient supporting documentation to demonstrate that the abandonment will not negatively affect surrounding roadways. For the purposes of this policy, a collector road is defined as any road that the department of public works has given a functional classification of collector or higher.
f.
The abandonment of any street within the city roadway network should not be inconsistent with any programmed capital projects and should otherwise conform to any approved local, regional or state transportation plans and the city comprehensive plan. Approval by the director of public works and the director of community development is required to indicate conformity.
g.
Prior to the initial public hearing on abandonment, the applicant shall provide documentation demonstrating contact and coordination with pertinent emergency service providers, utility providers, Henry County Schools, city trash service provider, and the postmaster to ensure that said services can be accommodated and that such vital public services will not be significantly impaired.
h.
For applicant initiated abandonments, the city will accept input from the community related to their support or opposition to an abandonment. For the purposes of this section, the "community" shall be defined as all of those owners whose property immediately adjoins or whose property is accessed by the right-of-way to be abandoned. Prior to the final public hearing before the mayor and city council to consider an application for abandonment a completed formal petition and all supporting forms and documentation shall be submitted to the department of public works. The formal petition submitted on behalf of the community shall comply with the minimum numerical standards set forth [in] Table 1.
Table 1. Required Percent Approval to Process Abandonment Petition
EXPAND
Number of Lots Required % Approval**
20 or less 100%
21—90 75%
91 or more 67%
  ** Note: Compliance with the required approval percentage rates is in no way determinative of the city's intent to abandon any right-of-way. The required approval percentage is merely one component of the process, state law considerations shall prevail.
i.
All property owners in the community shall be contacted by the applicant via certified mail prior to the initial public hearing. Notice must be mailed by the applicant to the community members no less than thirty days prior to the initial public hearing date. In the case where a community association has initiated the petition process no notification will be required for any person who has previously signed the petition in favor of abandonment.
j.
Each lot within the community shall be given an opportunity to sign a petition, expressing their opinion in favor of or in opposition to the abandonment. Any abstention, nonresponse or indication other than a "yes" by community members will be considered a "no." Signatures on the petition shall not be considered valid after a period of one year from the date of signing.
k.
Percentages will be calculated based on the number of lots expressing an affirmative or "yes" vote in favor of the abandonment, divided by the total number of lots in the community. Each lot counts as a single unit regardless of the number of owners signing. Where a community has a homeowner association or other legal entity that is authorized to act on behalf of its members and that may utilize percentages different than those in Table 1, such a mechanism shall not replace the petition process.
l.
Compliance with the application procedures is in no way determinative with respect to the city's authority or decision to abandon a roadway. The city council shall retain full legislative discretion to authorize or deny abandonment based upon controlling legal standards and state law.
m.
After the final public hearing and an affirmative action by the mayor and city council to abandon any right-of-way, the right-of-way shall be disposed of in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 32-7-3, 32-7-4, and 36-37-6. The applicant will file a revised plat, legal description(s) indicating the new dispensation of the property or any other required documentation. Any expenses or fees incurred in the filing will be the sole responsibility of the applicant.
n.
The applicant will grant the city, county or other utility permanent easements as may be required for the entirety of the existing right-of-way, or as may be needed, at no cost as a condition of abandonment prior to final dispensation of the property.
o.
Any abandonment request that is denied by the mayor and city council may not be resubmitted for a period of one year following the date of denial.
p.
After abandonment, the right-of-way shall become privately owned and the city shall no longer maintain the roadway or accept any liability for the roadway or any area within the private right-of-way. Any maintenance, such as, but not limited to, resurfacing, stormwater management, sinkhole repair, shall be the responsibility of the owner(s).
q.
Any access control, such as a gate, that the property owner(s) wish to install shall conform in design and construction to all relevant city standards, regulations, and processes, and must meet emergency access requirements. All access controls shall conform to city standards as if it was newly constructed. Recent abandonment will not be accepted as a justification for any exemptions or variances to these standards.
C.
Privatization. For the purposes of this section, privatization of a roadway shall mean the abandonment of the right-of-way to a community for the purposes of converting a public road to a private road while continuing to maintain access to the properties within the community. As a condition of approval for the privatization of any right-of-way the community shall continue to provide access to all properties previously served by the public road.
In addition to the criteria established for the abandonment of any right-of-way, as outlined in subsections (A)(1) and (2), privatization shall meet the following requirements:
1.
The department of public works will not support a request for privatization of any local road that connects two or more collector roads without sufficient supporting documentation to demonstrate that the abandonment will not negatively affect surrounding roadways. For the purposes of this section, a local road is defined as those roads built as part of a platted residential development.
2.
The applicant for any privatization request shall be a homeowner association or other legal entity established with the authority to act on behalf of all of the members of the defined community. The applicant is required to meet all of the application requirements provided by the city including the minimum percentage approval rates established for the formal petition for abandonment prior to the final public hearing.
3.
In the case of a road privatization the "community" shall be defined as all of those owners whose property adjoins the right-of-way or whose sole access is provided by the right-of-way to be abandoned or that may incur a financial obligation for the maintenance and preservation of the right-of-way should the abandonment resolution be approved.
4.
The applicant shall file financial statements reflecting assets similar to what is required for a homeowner association to finance a line of credit for capital assets. This information will not be made public to the fullest extent allowed by the Open Records Act and is only to insure solvency and to further demonstrate that the applicant has the financial means to fund those future costs associated with maintaining the asset.
5.
It is hereby the expressed declaration of the governing authority of the city that obtaining documented support from the community that an abandonment application is supported by a certain percentage of those affected is a material, though not dispositive, component in determining whether an abandonment serves the public interest. At the request of the applicant, an application for abandonment under this section may delay tendering formal petitions until such time as the council has adopted a resolution conditionally approving an abandonment. Any such conditional abandonment shall be for the express purpose of allowing the applicant sufficient time to secure all necessary formal petitions with the knowledge that the council has exercised its discretion and preliminarily sanctioned the abandonment. The resolution of conditional abandonment will expressly provide that upon the applicant tendering a formal petition meeting the percentage requirements in subsection (A)(2), Table 1, the abandonment petition shall be placed upon a future council agenda for final ratification of the abandonment. Upon approval of a resolution of conditional abandonment, the applicant will be notified of same and will be advised that submission of a formal petition meeting the percentage requirements in subsection (A)(2), Table 1 will be the final step in the abandonment process prior to placement on the agenda. The applicant will further be advised that the formal petition must be tendered to the council within six months of the resolution of conditional abandonment having been approved, and that a failure to tender the petitions within this period shall result in the abandonment request being deemed withdrawn. The community development director may grant one extension of up to ninety days in his/her reasonable discretion. The above notwithstanding, at any point during the abandonment process up through and including the point when the abandonment becomes subject to ratification on the consent agenda, the city council shall be authorized to exercise its discretion and determine that a particular abandonment does not serve the public interest and thereby deny same.
6.
After the public hearing process and an affirmative action by the mayor and city council to privatize any right-of-way, the right-of-way must remain private for a minimum of five years before being eligible to submit for public status again. If, after five years, a right-of-way is submitted for public acceptance the road shall be required to meet the construction and testing standards established by the city.
D.
Hearing Process.
1.
Once it has been determined that the initial application is complete and conforms to the requirements of the city, the application will be placed on the city council agenda for initial consideration. At that time, the council will determine whether to accept the application for further processing or to reject the application outright. Acceptance of the application by the council does not constitute final approval of the application or the abandonment of the public road or right-of-way, or any portion thereof. Upon a determination by the mayor and city council to accept the application for further processing, the applicant shall be duly notified. The applicant shall also be required to pay all required fees and comply with the requirements of this article and applicable state law prior to the initial public hearing. Any application that is not accepted for further processing by the council shall not be re-filed for a period of one year from the date that the application was rejected.
2.
Two public hearings shall be held before the mayor and city council; provided, however, the second public hearing shall not occur on the same day as the first. However, if one hundred percent approval is obtained by the community prior to the initial public hearing, the second public hearing will not be required.
3.
If, after the final public hearing, the mayor and city council finds that no substantial public purpose is served by the right-of-way or that the removal of the right-of-way from the municipal street system is otherwise in the best public interest, it may approve a resolution authorizing the abandonment of the public right-of-way. Such approval may be conditioned on the submittal of a signed petition meeting the approval percentages provided in subsection Aa)(2), Table 1. If the mayor and city council approve such a resolution then the right-of-way shall be considered surplus property and disposed of in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 32-7-3, 32-7-4, and 36-37-6.
(Ord. No. 15-11-047, § 8, 11-2-15)
16.04.072 - Alleys.
Alleys shall be provided at the rear of lots in residential, commercial, and industrial developments when approved by the community development director or as directed by the zoning ordinance or other provision. Alleys shall be a minimum of eighteen feet in width with a minimum paved area of sixteen feet and shall lie within a thirty-foot access easement. Appropriate covenants and easement agreements shall be filed with the final plat to assure of proper maintenance and assessment of the property owners on a perpetual basis.
(Ord. No. 15-11-047, § 8, 11-2-15)
16.04.073 - General construction requirements.
A.
Every subdivision developer shall be required to follow the requirements of the soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance of the city, to grade and improve streets, alleys and rights-of-way, to install curbs or ditches when required and to install street name signs in accordance with city's specifications. Every subdivider shall be required to comply with the inspection procedures of this chapter.
B.
All street design and construction and related material shall be in strict accordance with Georgia Department of Transportation "Standard Specifications, Construction of Public Streets and Bridges", 1993 Edition, and all revisions thereto and the requirements of Sections 16.04.074 and 16.04.075. Where circumstances dictate variations from the standard specifications, the governing body may vary the requirements, provided the design of materials accepted is in all ways commensurate with good practice.
C.
All materials, equipment, labor and other matters related to street construction shall be provided by the developer. The following is a summary of the improvements required:
1.
Grading. All streets, public streets, and alleys shall be graded to their full width right-of-way by the subdivider so that the pavements and sidewalks, when installed in the future, can be constructed on the same level plane. The preparation of the right-of-way before grading is started and the construction of cuts and fills shall be accomplished according to the specifications of the city (see Sections 16.04.074 and 16.04.075).
2.
Three copies of an as-built subgrade centerline profile shall be submitted to the Locust Grove Community Development Department. The profile shall include both proposed and as-built centerline elevations at every even station. No curb and gutter or waterlines shall be installed prior to subgrade approval.
3.
Storm Drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary curb, pipes, culverts, headwalls, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, swale ditches, and detention areas, shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water and prepared by a registered professional engineer or landscape architect.
4.
Public Streetway Surfacing. After preparation of the subgrade the public streetbed shall have base material and paving applied according to county specifications (see Sections 16.04.074 and 16.04.075).
(Ord. No. 15-11-047, § 8, 11-2-15)
16.04.074 - Construction requirements for residential subdivisions streets.
A.
The design and construction requirements for residential subdivisions shall comply with the minimum standards shown in Table 3-1.
B.
The grading, base and pavement for residential street construction shall be as follows:
1.
Grading. All streets shall be graded to the elevations shown on the approved construction plans.
a.
Clearing and Grubbing. After the development permit has been issued by the Locust Grove Community Development Department, and a pre-construction conference has been held, the development inspector duly notified, and all required silt and erosion control measures installed and approved, the contractor may only clear and grub those lots that have received approval for construction of homes or buildings. All trees, stumps, logs, roots, grass, weeds, poles, and other objectionable matter shall be cleared and grubbed in the areas where utilities, principle buildings, and necessary infrastructure have been permitted to go. All other vegetation, especially trees, shall be maintained on the lot or lots throughout the extent of the development. Removal of required vegetation to meet the city tree ordinance and/or landscape plan shall prohibit continuance of any field or construction work on the site. Replacement of vegetation at an equal portion to that removed or damaged shall occur prior to continuation of the project, or within the construction limits of the project. No rubbish or other material resulting from the clearing and grubbing of the public street way may be buried within a lot or future lot of record. If burning is permitted, all burn pits must be located outside of the public streetway construction limits.
b.
Excavation. All grading operations shall be planned and executed by the contractor in such a manner as to provide suitable subgrade material in the top twelve inches of the public streetway. In areas where the material in place is not suitable for subgrades, these areas shall be undercut a minimum of twelve inches and back filled with suitable material. All rock and boulders in the public streetbed shall be excavated to a depth of at least twelve inches below the subgrade and the space back filled to the correct grade with suitable material. Any stones, broken rock, or boulders resulting from the grading of the public streetway may not be placed in any public streetway fill area except when approved by a development inspector and then under his supervision. During the construction of the public streetway on a day to day basis, the public streetbed edges shall be kept lower than the center and the grading shall be done so that the surfaces of the excavated areas and fill will be kept reasonably smooth and will drained. Adequate surface ditches shall be cut at the tops of cut slopes, extending to each end of the cuts in order to carry the water from the side hill. Side ditchers or gutters emptying from cuts to fill areas shall be turned outward so as to prevent erosion of the fill slopes.
c.
Placement of Fill. Fill construction shall not begin until all clearing and grubbing of the fill area has been completed. All depressions in the ground shall be filled level with the adjacent surface using suitable material and compacted to the approximate density to the surrounding soil before placement of the fill is begun. The entire area upon which fill is to be placed shall be plowed, scarified, and finely broken up to a depth of a minimum of six inches. Before the placement of fill material is begun, all loosened soil shall be compacted the approximate density of the underlying soil. Where a depth of fill and surfacing is three feet or less, the original ground shall be compacted a minimum twelve inches deep to at least ninety-five percent of the maximum laboratory dry density as determined from representative samples of the material being compacted. In areas where layers of organic or other unstable materials exists, the existing ground shall be excavated, for the full width of the fill area, to the underlining stable material. The subgrade thus created shall then be compacted to the approximate density of the underlying material. All fill material shall be deposited and spread in uniform horizontal layers, not more than six inches thick, for the full width of the fill area, and these layers shall be kept uniform by the use of graders, bulldozers or other approved equipment. Each layer shall be compacted within the range of optimum moisture content necessary to achieve the compaction required. Material containing too much water shall be dried to the correct moisture content. If the material is too dry, water shall be added and uniformly mixed with the soil before it is compacted. Fills shall be compacted to at least ninety-five percent of the maximum dry density to within the top twelve inches of the fill. The top twelve inches of the fill shall be compacted to at least one hundred percent of the maximum dry density. The entire public streetbed shall be scarified and compacted with a sheep's foot or other approved rollers. While the work is in progress, contractor shall maintain the surface in a manner so that the excavation, fills, subgrade, base course, and ditches always present a smooth and even surface.
d.
The contractor shall have available on the job at all times at least one motor patrol grader with adequate power to blade and maintain the public streetbed. Suitable scarifies shall also be available for use wherever necessary.
2.
Final Finishing of Public Streetway. After all excavation has been completed and all fills have been placed, the entire public street bed surface shall be finally shaped with a grading machine supplemented with hand work whenever required, to secure a smooth surface and uniform cross-section specified. When final shaping is finished, the public street surface shall conform accurately to the line, grade and cross section shown of plans, and no roots, sod, grass, stones, or other unsuitable material shall remain in the top twelve inches of the finished public streetbed. All ditches and drains shall be opened to effectively drain the public streetway.
3.
Placement of Curb and Gutter. After sanitary sewer and water lines have been installed, all storm drainage in place, and the final finishing of the public streetway has been approved by the development inspector, the installation of the concrete curb and gutter may begin, All concrete curb and gutter shall be in accordance with Locust Grove Construction Standard. Any curb and gutter, which does not conform to a true section, texture, line and grade shall be removed and replaced as directed by the development inspector.
4.
Subgrade. Before placing any pavement base the entire surface of the subgrade shall be plowed, harrower, and mixed to a depth of at least six inches. If a subgrade stabilization material is required it shall be incorporated into the subgrade at this time. After the material has been thoroughly mixed the subgrade shall be brought into a proper line and grade and compacted to one hundred percent of maximum dry density just prior to placing the base material. The centerline profile shall conform to the established elevations with an acceptable tolerance of one-half inch. The acceptance crown tolerance shall be one-half inch.
5.
Base Construction. The Locust Grove Development Inspector shall be notified twenty-four hours prior to the placing of any base material. After the inspector is satisfied all the equipment necessary for the proper construction of public street base is on the project and the subgrade has been brought to the proper line, grade and crown, and compacted to the required density he may authorize the placing of the base material. After the base material has been placed and compacted to the required density the inspector will check the completed base course. All areas found to be deficient shall be marked and corrected before any asphalt pavement is placed. Areas where the crown is found to exceed that which is specified or the exposed edge of the concrete gutter is less than the minimum depth required, shall be reshaped and rolled to obtain the required cross-section. After the compacted material has been approved, cores shall be taken as directed by the development inspector to determine the thickness of the constructed base course. Areas found to be deficient in thickness shall be corrected as directed by the development inspector. A copy of all delivery tickets for the graded aggregate base material shall be furnished prior to placing any asphaltic concrete paving material. A shortage in the base material used shall require that the asphaltic concrete surface course thickness be increased. All work and materials shall be in accordance with the pertinent graded aggregate construction sections of the Georgia Department of Transportation "Standard Specifications", latest edition.
a.
In lieu of constructing the previously mentioned paving section, a soil cement base shall be a minimum of five inches in thickness of the surface course shall remain at two inches. All soil cement construction shall be in accordance with the "soil cement construction" sections of the Georgia Department of Transportation "Standard Specifications", latest edition. The preparation of the soil cement base shall be done under the supervision of a professional engineer registered in the state. A letter stamped by the engineer attesting to the construction of the soil cement base shall be submitted to the Locust Grove Community Development Department for approval.
6.
Paving. After the public street base has been accepted by the development inspector and upon his approval the contractor shall begin the construction of the asphaltic concrete pavement. All asphaltic concrete material and construction shall be in accordance with the "hot mix asphaltic concrete construction" sections of the Georgia Department of Transportation "Standard Specifications", latest edition. After the material has been placed and rolled to the satisfaction of the inspector, he shall check the cross section of the finished pavement. Any area found to be deficient shall be marked and a record of deficiencies made by the development inspector.

If, in the opinion of the development inspector, the extent of deficiencies will impair the performance of the pavement, he shall direct that an overlay of a minimum thickness of one inch be placed before the public streetway is opened to traffic. A copy of the delivery tickets for the asphaltic concrete material used shall be furnished to the development inspector at the time of completion of the work. If the delivery tickets indicate a shortage in the material used from the quantity estimated the development inspector may require a minimum one-inch overlay of the streets.
Upon acceptance of the surface course by the development inspector, the developer shall have core tests made as directed by county engineer to verify the thickness of the street base and asphalt pavement. If these indicate a deficiency in thickness of the street base asphalt pavement an overlay shall be required when the following deficiencies occur:
1.
When the number of cores deficient in thickness within the allowable one-quarter of an inch tolerance exceeds thirty-five percent of the total cores taken on one street.
2.
When two or more consecutive tests show a deficiency of more than one quarter of an inch allowable tolerance. When a core shows a deficiency in excess of the allowable tolerance additional cores will be taken to delineate the area of the deficient thickness.
3.
Any required overlay shall extend a minimum of one hundred fifty feet beyond the outer limits of the deficient area for the full width of the street. Smooth, neat joints shall be cut normal to the public streetway for full depth of asphalt pavement, removing the original pavement for a minimum of ten feet at each end of the overlay. The thickness of the overlay shall be determined by the depth of the deficient area and shall not be less than one inch in compacted thickness. The type of material used in the overlay shall be specified by the city.
7.
Shoulder and Drainage Improvements. After the paving has been inspected and approved, the pavement edges or behind the curb and gutter shall be back filled and compacted and the ditches and back slopes properly graded, shaped, seeded and mulched. An eighty percent stand of grass must be obtained. All swales and ditches excavated below required depth shall be back filled and compacted to ninety-five percent of maximum dry density.
