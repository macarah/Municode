Each appointment or reappointment to the county board of assessors will be for a term of three years. The terms of a voting majority of the board of assessors may not expire in the same calendar year. Staggered initial appointments or reappointments of a duration of not less than three nor more than six years may be made to prevent such an occurrence.
