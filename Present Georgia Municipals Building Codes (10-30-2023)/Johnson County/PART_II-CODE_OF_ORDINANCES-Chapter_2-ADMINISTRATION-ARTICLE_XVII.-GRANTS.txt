ARTICLE XVII. - GRANTS

Sec. 2-464. - Purpose.
The purpose of this policy is to provide direction in the application, acceptance and administration of funds awarded through grants to the county from other local governments, the state or federal government, nonprofit agencies, philanthropic organizations and the private sector.
(Code 2002, § 1-7-1)
Sec. 2-465. - Application and acceptance of grants.
(a)
The county administrator is given authority to make application for and accept grants that:
(1)
Are expected to be $50,000.00 or less on an annual basis with no required county match;
(2)
Are expected to be $25,000.00 or less on an annual basis with a required match of 20 percent or less; or,
(3)
Are expected to be $10,000.00 or less on an annual basis with a required match of over 40 percent.
(b)
The county commission must approve the application of and acceptance of any grants in excess of the limits established in this article.
(c)
The county will assess the merits of a particular program as if it were funded with local tax dollars. Local tax dollars will not be used to make up for losses of intergovernmental aid without first reviewing the program and its merits as a budgetary increment. Therefore, no grant will be accepted that will incur management and reporting costs greater than the grant amount.
(Code 2002, § 1-7-2)
Sec. 2-466. - Grant administration.
(a)
Each department, authority or board must notify the county administrator upon acceptance of any grant. Prior to the receipt or expenditure of grant revenues, the county administrator must be provided with the following information prior to receiving grant revenues or making purchases against the grant:
(1)
Copy of grant application;
(2)
Notification of grant award;
(3)
Financial reporting and accounting requirements including separate account codes and/or bank accounts; and
(4)
Schedule of grant payments.
(b)
Each board or authority is responsible for the management of its grant funds and periodic reporting.
(c)
Any departments, commissions or authorities in the county who receive a grant from the county budget will be required to furnish the commissioner' office a financial statement before funds budgeted will be issued. Financial reports are due by February 1 each year.
(d)
The county shall establish two funds for grant disbursements. They shall be a major grant fund for all single grants in excess of $50,000.00 or two percent of county revenue and a multiple grant fund to accumulate by division all grants under $50,000.00. These funds shall be subject to audit by the independent auditor and all state grant funds must have annual reports completed and submitted to the state department of audits.
