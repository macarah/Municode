Editor's note— Printed herein is the county's design guidelines manual—bypass design overlay district standards, as revised by the board of commissioners on February 2, 2016. Future amendments will be notated by the use of history notes. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes headings and catchlines have been made uniform and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statues, and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

1. - Purpose and intent.
The Jones County design guidelines manual is intended to be a helpful design resource representing community expectations for new construction, additions, renovations and rehabilitation of existing buildings along the Jones County Bypass.
The bypass design overlay (BDO) district has been implemented to help create a sense of place for Jones County, preserve the aesthetic environment while enhancing development, and to differentiate Jones County from other communities in the area. Often, conventional development patterns produce linear development, asphalt wastelands, harsh and glaring light levels, and a proliferation of billboards and other distracting signage and visual clutter. Inadequately planned and regulated strip development has also spawned traffic congestion, competing signage and incompatible architecture. As such, these design guidelines have been adopted for the following purposes:
•
To help create a sense of place for the county that will enhance the existing architecture in the county and will differentiate the county from other communities in the area.
•
To preserve the aesthetic appeal of the county by proactively conserving greenspace and foliage, while sustaining the visual attractiveness of development to match the character of the county.
•
To improve gateways and corridors leading into central Jones County and the City of Gray for the purpose of enhancing directional wayfinding.
•
To promote the cultural heritage of the county and stimulate the tourism economy.
•
To provide for enhanced safety and to ensure the effective movement of people and goods throughout the county.
This manual is both a policy and regulatory document that outlines a vision for the area surrounding the North Gray Bypass through addressing basic aspects of urban design. The use of this manual for future development projects is important to promote a community environment that stimulates new investment and enhances the existing environment.
2. - Applicability.
The bypass design overlay district was officially established as section 86 in the county zoning ordinance on [January 5, 2016], and the guidelines of this manual shall apply to any development within the bypass design overlay district. The BDO district shall include every parcel located in unincorporated Jones County within 500 feet of the right-of-way of the North Gray Bypass. If any part of the parcel is within the 500-foot buffer, the entire parcel will be considered part of the BDO district, and must conform to these guidelines.
Single-family dwellings are exempt. Agricultural structures, and any accessory buildings of single-family dwellings or agricultural structures shall be exempt from any and all requirements of this section, provided that the aforementioned structure does not lie within 200 feet of the right-of-way of the North Gray Bypass.
The existing zoning map and underlying zoning regulations governing all properties within the bypass design overlay district shall remain in full force and effect. The regulations contained within this appendix shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to said zoning regulations. Except where it is otherwise explicitly provided, whenever the following overlay regulations are in conflict with said existing underlying zoning regulations, the overlay guidelines shall take precedence.
3. - Design review process.
Design review is the process by which the design review board approves major changes and/or new constructions that are planned for properties located within the bypass design overlay district and issues a certificate of design review which allows the proposed changes to take place. The guidelines in this manual apply to new construction, additions, renovations and rehabilitations to existing buildings within both districts. The design review process is often triggered by a building permit application; however, building permits cannot be issued until design review is complete. Although some types of work projects, such as installation of a walkway or a fence, may not require a building permit, design review is still required. Property owners, as well as the design review board, shall follow the consistent design review procedures described in section 86 of the county zoning ordinance, and detailed below.
There is a four-step process, outlined below, that property owners must follow before undertaking any improvements which may require the procurement of a certificate of design review from the county.
STEP 1: Determine need for certificate of design review.
There are certain types of routine maintenance activities that property owners can carry out without obtaining a certificate of design review. These activities are fairly narrow in scope, however, depending on the extent of the maintenance effort, they could require a design review. A certificate of design review is required before a building permit can be issued for any material change in appearance to property within the BDO district. A "material change in appearance" shall be defined as the construction of a new structure, or a change that will affect the exterior architectural features of any structure, site, or work-of-art within a designated overlay district.
Property owners should call the county zoning enforcement officer prior to initiating any routine maintenance on their property in order to obtain verbal administrative approval. A simple phone call can save a property owner both time and money during maintenance projects.
The following lists include examples of activities and whether or not they require design review. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, and the final determination of if a project meets the standard of a material change in appearance lies with the zoning enforcement officer:
Activities that do not require review:
•
Painting of original wood siding, except in the case of a radical change of color. Note: Routine maintenance does not include the painting of historically unpainted masonry.
•
Demolition or removal of a non-historic or non-original addition to a building, as long as the historic portion of the building is not adversely affected.
•
Demolition or removal of an outbuilding that is non-historic or non-original to the site.
•
Small scale projects that involve the repair or replacement of deteriorated architectural features or exterior finishes.
•
Repair or replacement of a water-damaged fascia board on a cornice. Note: If all of the fascia boards on a structure other than a single-family dwelling need replacement, a certificate of design review is required.
•
Replacement of a broken window pane, as long as the original window frame and mountings are undisturbed.
•
Interior modifications or repairs to any building or structure.
Activities that do require review:
•
Commencement of excavation for construction purposes.
•
Exterior additions visible from public rights-of-way.
•
Construction of new buildings.
•
New or expanded parking areas.
•
New sidewalk construction.
•
Changes to windows, doors or existing storefronts.
•
Removal or alteration of any architectural features, details, or elements.
•
New signs or a change in the location of advertising visible from the public right-of-way.
•
New fences and retaining walls.
•
Painting unpainted masonry.
•
Addition or change of exterior lighting.
•
Repair or replacement of materials that are identical to or closely match the original.
•
Renovations consisting of removal and replacement or the covering of existing materials with new materials.
•
Demolition or relocation.
•
Roof replacement.
•
Work requiring a building permit.
STEP 2: Submission of application for design review certificate.
Applications for design review approval shall be made as required by the zoning enforcement officer and shall, at minimum, contain the following information:
•
Elevation drawings and color, and material samples. Every application or review involving the construction of a new building or structure and alterations and/or additions to existing structures shall be accompanied by exterior elevation drawings drawn to scale, signed by an architect, engineer or other appropriate professional, and submitted in sufficient number of copies as required by the zoning enforcement officer. Said exterior elevation drawings shall clearly show, in sufficient detail the exterior appearance and architectural design of proposed change(s) to buildings or structures and new construction, as applicable. Each application shall also indicate proposed materials, textures and colors and provide samples of materials and colors.
•
Photographs. All applications shall be accompanied by photographs of all sides of the existing building(s) or structure(s) affected, and of adjoining properties. Photographs shall be submitted in printed copy and in digital form unless otherwise specified by the zoning enforcement officer.
•
Site plan and landscaping plan. For every application, a plot plan or site plan drawn to scale shall be submitted which shows all improvements affecting appearances, such as walls, walks, terraces, plantings, tree protection areas, accessory buildings, signs, lights, and other elements.
•
Fee. A fee, if required by the county commission, shall be submitted for said application.
•
Additional information. Any additional information, as may reasonably be required by the zoning enforcement officer, shall be submitted with the application.
STEP 3: Design review board application review. When reviewing applications for alteration, new construction, relocation, or demolition, the design review board shall consider the criteria set forth in section 4 of this manual. All certificate of design review applications shall be submitted to the zoning enforcement officer, who shall review the application for completeness. The application shall be considered at the next design review board meeting, to be held between ten and 60 calendar days from the date upon which the application is certified as complete.
Any applicant shall have the opportunity to request a preliminary review for the purpose of gathering information and informal feedback from the design review board. The board may suggest revisions that enable the preliminary plan to conform to the design guidelines manual, but shall not issue a final ruling granting approval or denial to the applicant. Applicants are not required to have submitted an application for a certificate of design review prior to a preliminary hearing. The design review board reserves the final right to either permit or deny a preliminary hearing. Requests for a preliminary hearing shall be submitted to the zoning enforcement officer at least five calendar days prior to the next design review board meeting.
STEP 4: Action by the design review board.
A decision by the design review board on a design review application shall be made within 90 calendar days from the date a complete application is received. Failure of the design review board to act within this time period shall constitute approval and no other evidence is needed.
Upon completion of the final review, the design review board shall issue a certificate of design review if it finds the proposed change(s) in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the appearance and character of the overlay district. The design review board shall consider the appropriateness of any proposed material change in appearance in the context of the following criteria:
•
Consistency with the county design guidelines manual for the type of development and/or its proposed.
•
The nature and character of the surrounding areas, and the consistency and compatibility of the proposed application with such nature and character.
•
The general design, the character and appropriateness of design, scale of buildings, arrangement, materials, texture and colors (non-painted surfaces), of the structure in question and the relation of such elements to similar features of structures in the immediate surrounding area, site and landscaping.
•
Whether the proposed design includes defects such as: character foreign to the area, arresting and spectacular effects, a multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance, and the absence of unity and coherence in composition not in consonance with the density and character of the present structure(s) or surrounding area.
•
The interior arrangement or use, provided it has no effect on exterior architectural features, safety, or utility, shall not be considered.
Application approved—Certificate of design review issued.
If an application is approved, the design review board shall issue a certificate of design review to the applicant for the proposed work on the property. The zoning enforcement officer or his/her designee shall ensure the applicant's compliance with the certificate of design review after the work has been completed.
All changes to existing buildings and proposed new construction shall conform to the certificate of design review issued for the project. In the event work is not performed in accordance with such certificate, the zoning enforcement officer shall issue a stop-work order.
An approved certificate of design review shall be valid for 18 months, after which time it shall expire. Upon expiration, a new application must be submitted and a new certificate of design review issued by the design review board prior to commencement of any construction or building modifications.
Application denied—Certificate of design review not issued.
The design review board shall deny a certificate of design review if it finds the material change in appearance would have a substantial adverse effect on the overlay district. If an application is denied, the design review board will notify the applicant, in writing, of its decision and state the reason(s) for the denial. Modifications or alternatives to the proposed project should be included, and applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss such modifications with the design review board. The applicant may resubmit a new or revised application for consideration. The denial of a certificate of design review shall be binding, and no building permit shall be issued, unless the denial of a certificate of design review is reversed on appeal.
Appeals.
Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the design review board relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of design review may appeal such determination in a manner consistent with section 115 of the Jones County CLDR. Once all appeals have been exhausted, the manner in question shall not return to the design review board without revision.
4. - Design standards.
A.
General Guidelines.
1.
Applicability.
Unless indicated or otherwise exempted, the development requirements and guidelines of this manual are intended to apply to all land uses within the bypass design overlay district. However, the cumulative impact of any proposed material change in appearance shall be considered when determining compliance with this manual.
Any structure or property existing in the BDO district at the time of the approval of this section shall not, in their current condition, be affected by any of the standards or guidelines adopted for this district. Individual improvements to property within the BDO district shall be considered individually for compliance with applicable guidelines. Improvements made to one aspect of a property shall not force the remainder of a preexisting property into compliance with all of the remaining guidelines for the district.
2.
Compatibility.
•
The site plan, building design, and landscaping of new development shall achieve a high quality appearance that will enhance the surrounding area.
•
The scale, mass, volume, and style of any new construction or addition shall be compatible with the human scale of development, and shall blend with the natural landscape to the greatest extent possible.
•
Site planning and design of projects proposed adjacent to dissimilar land uses shall carefully address the potential undesirable impacts on existing uses. These impacts include, but are not limited to, traffic, parking, circulation and safety issues, light and glare, noise, odors, dust control and security concerns.
3.
Site planning.
•
Creative site planning alternatives, such as cluster development, reclamation, mixed-use enterprises, planned centers, and open space zoning, shall be encouraged to offer alternatives to linear strip development.
•
Significant cultural, historic, natural, and scenic features shall be identified for preservation during the site planning process.
•
Buildings shall be integrated with, not isolated from, their surroundings. All design elements, including without limitation, buildings and appurtenances, landscape design and vegetation, parking, driveways, walkways, signage and lighting, shall be coordinated to create a continuous and harmonious streetscape. Where possible, building appurtenances shall be shared.
•
Landscape design shall be an integral component. Retention of existing vegetation is encouraged. Adequate provision for new landscaping areas at the frontage, along the property perimeters, and within pavement areas is essential. Landscape plans shall utilize preferred plant materials, establish planting sizes, and include irrigation and screened utilities.
4.
Design for pedestrians.
Development shall, wherever possible, allow for the movement of pedestrians as well as the movement of vehicular traffic. Where pedestrian circulation crosses vehicular routes, a change in grade, materials, textures or colors shall be provided to emphasize the conflict point and improve its visibility and safety. Accent strips of brick or textured paving may also be appropriate for defining pedestrian walkways.
B.
Building siting guidelines.
The following guidelines shall apply for the purpose of siting buildings, parking, and other structures on property located within the bypass design overlay district. The provisions of this section shall not apply to single-family residential or agricultural land uses.
1.
Building setback.
Commercial and institutional properties in typical downtown areas have more-limited setbacks than other surrounding locations. This style shall be imitated throughout the bypass design overlay district.
•
Buildings shall be constructed in the BDO district to create a plane of building walls in close proximity to the street. As infill development occurs, these buildings shall have a similar setback and shall be close to adjacent structures.
•
Structures within the BDO shall be sited so as to minimize the area between the right-of-way and the structure. These structures shall have a setback between 40 and 80 feet.
•
Buffers between the right-of-way and structure shall contain landscaping and sidewalks, and may contain a driveway, but shall not contain any off-street parking between the structure and right-of-way, unless said parking spaces are not visible from the right-of-way.
•
Large-scale, single-use facilities may be permitted to exceed the 40 to 80 foot setback, provided that they shall be sited behind or above smaller scale uses of pedestrian orientation.
2.
Building orientation.
•
The main entrances of all principal structures shall be oriented in a way that provides access both for individuals travelling by foot as well as by automobile. The face of the building with the main entrance shall be considered the primary façade. If, due to site constraints, it is determined that new construction must be oriented so that the primary facade does not face the street, then any secondary façade facing the street must be designed with form, composition, and details consistent with and appropriate to the primary façade.
•
If a new building is to be constructed on a corner lot, the building shall be designed so that architectural emphasis is placed on two elevations; either hierarchically, with emphasis on the facade oriented toward the major street; or equally, with both elevations treated as primary facades.
º
Due to the limited access of the North Gray Bypass, the façade fronting the bypass shall not be utilized as the primary entrance.
•
The design review board shall review any proposed building orientation, and shall evaluate the proposal on the basis of connectivity, and efficiency of both pedestrian and vehicular movement.
º
Secondary entrances may be permitted to achieve this goal with the approval of the design review board.
•
Where an access road is in use, the design review board may consider alternative orientation proposals for buildings not visible from the public right-of-way.
3.
Height, scale and massing.
As new construction will dominate development in the BDO, the scale of such buildings shall be carefully considered at a human scale, so as to not overshadow the surrounding natural environment.
•
One-story buildings are preferred in the BDO area. The scale of the structure shall be proportional to setback.
•
The human scale shall be reinforced by including appropriate decorative and functional elements that enhance the character of the district, such as storefronts on traditionally commercial building forms, and porches on traditionally residential building form.
•
Massing shall be used that imitates the shape and size of historic buildings within a small downtown setting, such as gray.
•
A building's proportions will be compared to other buildings in the vicinity, and with the size of the lot. If a proposed building is over 10,000 square feet, or has a façade greater than 100 feet in length, then setbacks, fenestration, and other techniques shall be used to minimize the visual impact of the building.
º
Where multiple structures are proposed as part of a single development, smaller structures shall have a smaller setback, and be located more prominently to minimize the visual impact of the larger building.
4.
Additions to existing buildings.
Location and orientation.
•
Location of additions shall not adversely affect the façade of existing buildings, and additions shall be on the rear or side elevations.
•
The original orientation of the structure shall be maintained. If the primary entrance is located on the street façade, it shall remain in that location.
•
The addition and existing building shall be differentiated by using different wall planes, rooflines or cornice levels.
Size.
•
The size of the addition shall be complimentary to the existing structure and shall not visually overpower the existing building.
Roofline and roof pitch.
•
Rooflines for additions to the existing buildings shall be compatible in pitch and form with the original roof and the style of the building.
•
Rooflines for new additions shall be secondary to those of the existing structure.
Design.
•
New additions shall be designed to avoid destruction of historic materials or character-defining features, if present.
•
Design of the new addition shall be compatible with and respectful of the existing building. New work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with its massing, size, scale and architectural features.
5.
Accessory buildings.
Garages, storage buildings, and any other accessory structure shall be allowed to the extent permitted by the county zoning ordinances. These structures shall reflect the character of the existing primary structure and adjacent structures, and shall be compatible in terms of scale, height, size, roof shape, materials, and detailing. The scale, height, size, roof shape, materials, detailing and location of such out-buildings shall be sensitive to the character, site and environment of the adjacent structure when the accessory structure is within 200 feet of the public right-of-way.
6.
Parking.
In General.
•
Off-street parking shall not be required for any nonresidential use, when it has been adequately demonstrated to the board that a sufficient amount of off-street parking is available within 600 feet to serve the proposed use.
•
Shared parking areas utilized by more than one building or business are encouraged, to minimize large areas of pavement.
•
Properties forming commercial blocks, where the building extends from side-lot-line to side-lot-line, may provide parking in the rear of the buildings, on the corner of such block or "pooled parking" at an adjacent public/private lot. The applicant shall show proposed "pooled" parking areas in their development plans before any such requests shall be approved.
•
A large area of asphalt parking without landscaping, adjacent to the roadway, is not permitted. The required alternative is parking on another side of the building with interspersed landscaping amid parking spaces.
Screening of parking areas.
•
All parking lots containing five or more spaces that front a public street shall be screened by an evergreen hedge, an earth berm, or brick masonry wall or combination thereof. The hedge, berm, or wall must be no lower than two feet and no higher than four feet in height.
•
To preserve a line of sight as vehicular traffic enters and leaves, hedges, berms, and walls shall not be closer than four feet to an entrance or exit.
Off-street parking design.
Off-street parking areas shall be designed to minimize breaks in the pedestrian environment along the public street and create safe and comfortable passage for pedestrians. The following standards shall therefore be met:
•
Parking lots shall be placed behind buildings, as viewed from an adjacent street. Parking along the side of the building will only be permitted if the lot is too shallow for parking in the rear. Off-street parking is not permitted in front of the primary building façade, unless such parking is not visible from the public right-of-way along any existing street.
•
Parking lots are to be treated as enclosed rooms for cars, with enclosure provided by tree and shrub plantings. Landscaping shall be required around the perimeter.
•
Landscaped islands shall be included every ten spaces within the parking lot.
•
Parking lots shall be designed to allow pedestrians to safely move from their vehicles to the building. Corridors within the parking area shall channel pedestrians from the car to the perimeter of the lot or to the buildings.
•
To maintain pedestrian comfort and calm the speed of entering traffic, driveways to parking areas shall be no wider than 36 feet.
7.
Provisions for specific uses.
Drive-through facilities.
•
Drive-through facilities shall be located to the rear or side of the building.
Gas station pump islands.
•
Gas station pump islands must be located behind the principal building and substantially obstructed from view from the public right-of-way.
C.
Building façade guidelines.
The following guidelines shall applied for the purpose of guiding the appearance of structures on property located within the bypass design overlay district. The provisions of this section shall apply to all land uses within the BDO, including single-family residential and agricultural land use.
1.
Building façades and materials.
Preferred exterior building façade materials in the bypass design overlay district are wood siding and brick masonry. Brick is the most preferred exterior finish material. Materials having a wood siding appearance, such as fiber cement board, are compatible substitutions. Stucco is also acceptable in limited areas (e.g. parapets).
The following exterior finishes are not permitted within the BDO:
•
Exposed plywood or OSB.
•
Exposed unfinished foundation walls.
•
Glass curtain walls.
•
Highly reflective, shiny or mirror-like materials.
•
Unplastered, exposed concrete masonry unit (CMU's).
•
Metal finishes.
•
Aluminum and vinyl siding, except on single-family residential, manufactured housing, or agricultural structures, where it may be appropriate to match surrounding architectural styles.
Existing buildings.
•
All exterior wood and brick facade materials shall be respected and shall not be changed or concealed by the introduction of a different material.
•
When the existing façade materials have been introduced to the building at a later date and are not the original material type, then such materials may be removed so long as the resulting facade material is returned back to the original material type.
•
Balconies and porches shall not be added to the fronts of non-residential buildings which never had them.
New construction.
•
Façades greater than 100 feet in length must incorporate wall plane projections or recesses thereby creating bays; said bays forming a different plane by at least one foot. No uninterrupted length of façade shall exceed 100 feet.
•
Each building shall feature at least one main entrance, which shall be located, with the approval of the design review board, to enhance both pedestrian and vehicular accessibility to the greatest extent possible. Where a main building faces more than two public streets, an entrance for each side may be proposed.
•
Any non-residential or non-agricultural façade shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings, or other similar features along no less than 60 percent of their length.
•
Where additional establishments will be located within or adjacent to the principal building, the solid-to-void criteria applies to each individual façade. All windows shall be recessed and shall include visually prominent framing features.
•
All storefronts shall include their own door, regardless of the number of storefronts within a single building.
•
Do not clad one or more sides in brick and the remaining elevations in clapboard or other siding.
•
Where the construction of two-story commercial buildings may be appropriate, the façade shall include the storefront, upper façade and a cornice.
2.
Ornamentation.
Existing buildings in the county usually have few decorative architectural details.
•
Detailing on new construction shall be restrained, and shall be limited to cornices, decorative masonry, brackets, and similar aesthetic features.
•
Limited use of glass block, alternative masonry blocks, stucco, and synthetic stucco may be considered for the creation of building details.
3.
Doors and windows.
Avoiding box-like buildings, windows, doors and other features is important to obtain the traditional solid-to-void ratio.
•
Where present, historic windows shall be maintained and preserved. Whenever possible, damaged portions of historic windows shall be repaired rather than replaced in total.
•
A ratio of solids (walls) to voids (windows and doors), shall be maintained to preserve a diversity of appearance within each individual storefront and to reinforce the human scale of development. Commercial storefronts will often have more horizontal elements and a higher ratio of window-to-wall than the upper stories of the same building.
•
Use windows with true divided lights or interior and exterior fixed muntins with internal pacers to reference traditional designs. The profile and dimensions of the muntins shall be proportional to the size and design of the windows.
•
Avoid designing false windows in new construction.
•
Do not use tinted or mirrored glass on major façades of the building.
•
Alternative window materials, including metal, may be determined to be appropriate if they are designed to fit the style of the building.
•
Storm doors and storm windows shall be permitted so long as they do not damage or conceal significant features and are visually compatible in size, style, and color with the structure and adjacent structures. Metal storm doors and storm windows shall have a factory painted finish or shall be painted to match the window color. Aluminum or bronze anodized finishes are not permitted.
4.
Roofs.
Parapet roof forms are preferred in the bypass design overlay district, as large expanses of flat roofs shall not be visible, and coverage of large expanses of roof with gable or hip forms makes the roof too prominent and out of character with the surrounding environment, both built and natural.
•
Any rooftop-mounted equipment shall be incorporated into the overall design of a new building, and shall be screened on all sides in a manner consistent with the design of the rest of the building.
•
For existing buildings, any changes in roof shape shall not be visible. All decorative roof features shall be preserved and primary chimneys shall be repaired or rebuilt, not removed,
•
Skylights shall not draw attention or detract from roof features, nor shall they interrupt the overall lines of the roof shape. Skylights shall be located on the rear facade away from public view. The number and shape of skylights shall be sensitive to the existing roof. Bubble-type skylights are inappropriate unless concealed.
5.
Materials: Buildings and roofs.
•
The use of masonry, such as brick or stone, are the most appropriate exterior finish materials for new buildings.
•
Buildings with metal exterior finishes are not permitted.
•
The use of mirrored glass on the major façades of buildings is not allowed.
•
The use of stucco as an exterior finish material is allowed, but must be limited to 60 percent of the total building facade.
•
Roof materials and colors must be visually compatible and complement the style and period of the structure and shall not detract from the surrounding natural environment. Both metal roofing and asphalt shingles are acceptable. If asphalt shingles are used, they shall be of dark tones.
•
Fascia may be vinyl coated metal.
6.
Awnings.
•
The shape, size, and color of awnings shall be compatible with the structure and not conceal or damage any significant architectural details on the structure.
•
An awning must fit the width and shape of any storefront or window opening that it covers. For instance, straight-sloped awnings work best on rectangular storefronts while curved awnings work well on arched openings.
•
Canvas is the traditional material for awnings and is preferred for any new awning installation. Metal, plastic, or shiny, plastic-like fabric awnings shall not be used.
•
The illumination of awnings is prohibited.
•
Awnings shall not continue across two storefronts to join them as one business.
7.
Paint and color.
•
Brick, stone, and other naturally unpainted materials shall not be painted.
•
Paint color is not subject to review. However, the design review board is available to give guidance to any resident or business in choosing appropriate paint colors. Appropriate colors are those that are complimentary to the style and overall character of the building, and do not product visual clutter or distraction within the natural landscape.
8.
Utilities and mechanical equipment.
•
All utilities and mechanical equipment (i.e. satellite dishes, HVAC equipment, and trash receptacles) shall be placed to the rear of the building and screened when in public view.
•
Incompatible locations for utilities and mechanical equipment include: the front yard, on the front of a building, or on the side of a yard that is visible from the public right-of-way. Placement of equipment in or on these areas results in a negative visual impact on the BDO.
9.
Signs.
Signage shall be compatible with the visual character of the bypass design overlay district. Restraint shall be used in sign design as to limit the clutter, confusion and potential hazard associated with sign competition, while protecting the quality of the landscape. In addition to the regulations set forth in the county zoning ordinances, the following guidelines apply:
Placement.
•
No more than two signs shall be placed per commercial property, and all signs shall be placed in traditional locations.
•
Signs shall be mounted in such a manner as to minimize the impact on the building's exterior materials. Signs shall not obscure significant architectural features or details of a building,
•
Attached signs shall be in scale with and proportional to the host building, and be aligned as much as possible with signs of adjacent properties.
•
Freestanding signs shall be oriented perpendicular to traffic flow. Only one sign will be allowed per frontage. Corner lots may choose which traffic flow to address.
•
A horizontal sign shall not cover the tops of first-floor windows. Horizontal signs shall not project more than 12 inches from the surface of the building.
Materials.
•
Signs shall be brick, wood, metal or a close facsimile, which may be either painted or relief. Box cabinets, whether plastic, vinyl, or lexan are not permissible.
Dimensions.
•
Size of signs shall be in proportion to the architecture and scale of the building.
•
Ground signs are permitted, provided that the sign area is no larger than six feet in height by 12 feet in width.
Requirements for permitted signage.
•
Wall-mounted signs shall be integrated into the architecture of the building along the fascia.
•
Awning or canopy signage may be applied directly onto a canopy or awning.
•
Hanging signs, which hang perpendicular to the building, are allowed, as long as the sign has a minimum clearance of eight feet above the sidewalk for safety.
•
Externally illuminated signs shall be lighted by a white, steady stationary light of reasonable intensity, shielded and directed solely at the sign, to avoid glare or spillage of light into the road right-of-way or up into the sky.
•
Neon tubing shall not be physically connected to any exterior sign.
•
All lighting elements such as wires, junction boxes, transformers, ballasts, switches and panel boxes shall be concealed from view.
•
Display window signs shall not occupy more than 20 percent of the window area.
Non-permitted signage.
•
Pole signs are not allowed.
•
Internally illuminated, flashing, flickering or moving signs shall not be permitted.
•
LED lighting, neon light outlining windows, doors, buildings or other use of neon or LED lights shall not be permitted.
•
Roof signs which exceed the height of the ridge are not allowed.
D.
Landscaping guidelines.
The following guidelines shall be applied for the purpose of guiding landscaping within the bypass design overlay district. The provisions of this section shall apply to all land uses within the BDO, except for agricultural land use.
1.
Sidewalks and continuity.
New projects shall interconnect with existing sidewalks, and all new developments within the BDO shall include sidewalks. Where new projects adjoin undeveloped properties abutting public road frontage, the sidewalks installed with the new project shall terminate at the property line at a point where the next project can continue the sidewalk along the public road with little difficulty with slope and grade transitions. All development proposals shall coordinate pedestrian and vehicular circulation patterns with adjacent buildings and sites.
The minimum width for sidewalks within the district shall be five and one-half feet with a five-foot landscaped strip from face of curb (or edge of asphalt, as applicable) to edge of sidewalk.
2.
Landscaping.
Landscaping treatments shall be used to enhance the pedestrian experience and aesthetic value of the property, complement architectural features, and/or screen utility and parking areas. Landscape planning shall be integrated with the overall planning concept for any project. The design review board shall evaluate landscape plans as to the relationship to the existing landscape, landscapes on adjacent properties and public rights-of-way, and the existing and proposed building(s).
All landscaping shall conform to the regulations of the county zoning ordinances. The use of plants and planting materials native to Georgia is strongly encouraged. The design review board may waive any requirements if they feel the proposed landscaping will better enhance the proposed project. In doing so, the following principles shall guide the design review board:
a.
Complementation of building architecture to provide desirable benefits, such as:
•
Accentuation of major entrances.
•
Definition of spaces and views.
•
Enhancement of property values.
•
Glare reduction.
•
Groundwater recharge.
•
Highlighting of architectural features.
•
Humidification.
•
Noise and dust abatement.
•
Oxygen regeneration.
•
Regulation of pedestrian traffic.
•
Shading.
•
Site beautification.
•
Wildlife habitats, where appropriate.
•
Wind buffering.
•
Visual screening.
•
Visual variety and interest.
b.
Size, spacing and scale. Size and spacing of landscape elements shall be consistent with the size of the development, relate to an identifiable streetscape, and be appropriate to the scale and character of any proposed new structures.
c.
Hardscape. Landscape shading shall minimize large areas of unshaded pavement. Pavement materials shall be chosen for minimal reflected light and glare. The use of pervious materials is strongly encouraged to reduce surface water flows.
d.
Safety. Along streets and highways, plant materials must be selected and placed to avoid blocking sight lines at intersections and curb cuts. Along utility rights-of-way, planting shall not disrupt service or access to equipment or lines.
e.
Maintenance. Environmental and maintenance requirements of the plant materials selected. All irrigation systems shall be designed with no over-spray on pedestrian or vehicular travel-ways.
f.
Site furniture. Benches, fixed and moveable seating, with and without tables, low walls and fountains are encouraged landscape and street furniture. They add a variety of social opportunities, and provide pedestrians with natural places to pause and rest. Site furniture shall contain no advertising.
3.
Outdoor lighting.
Lighting practices shall include indirect lighting, which minimizes light pollution such as glare and light trespass. Carefully designed exterior lighting plans are required to provide the best balance between site safety, security, and appearance considerations. Restrained lighting patterns and fixture selection for commercial development will help prevent commercial lighting from adversely impacting residential properties. Lighting standards are generally applied and recommended by the Illuminating Engineers Society of North America.
•
No flickering or flashing lights shall be permitted.
•
Light sources shall not be located in buffer areas except on pedestrian walkways. Exterior lighting shall be of low intensity and shielded so that light will not spill out onto surrounding properties or project above the horizontal plane of building walls. All fixtures shall be full cut off.
•
Warm lighting colors are encouraged, and lamps emitting a color temperature in excess of 4,000 Kelvin are not allowed.
•
A maximum light level of PL-0.2 foot candles measured at ground level is permitted. Light levels for entrances to developments may only exceed PL- 0.2 foot candles for traffic safety purposes.
•
Lighting fixtures shall be compatible with the architectural character of existing buildings and the proposed development.
4.
Fences.
•
Security fences shall be located at the rear of buildings or similar low-visibility areas and shall be screened with landscaping.
•
Privacy fences shall be constructed of wood, limited in height, meet zoning/building codes and not be installed flush with building facades.
•
For residential-style buildings within the BDO, a fence in the front yard must meet all applicable county codes.
•
The usage of chain link fence material is discouraged for all properties, and shall only be permitted for use as a security fence in low-visibility areas, where it shall be screened with landscaping.
5.
Paving materials.
•
All new sidewalks, driveways and parking lots shall be constructed with asphalt or concrete to be compatible in texture, color, style and size with the main structure.
6.
Franchise and trademark architecture. Those buildings which have a distinctive exterior appearance and are readily identifiable with a franchise or chain shall be discouraged. If such buildings are used, they shall be modified to relate to both the specific site and to the guidelines of this guide, particularly regarding the building's siting, scale and construction materials.
•
To maintain the unique character of the district, buildings shall not be branded using a corporate architectural style.
•
Franchise architecture (building design that is trademarked or identified with a particular restaurant/retail store chain or corporation and is generic in nature) is not permitted in the district.
•
Artificial themes that are unrelated to the county or that represent other objects are not appropriate. For example, buildings that look like Spanish missions, English Tudor or Polynesian villages, shall be avoided.
E.
Relocation and demolition criteria.
1.
Relocation criteria.
Relocation of structures in the bypass design overlay district shall be defined as moving a structure from one site to another, or moving a structure from outside the district into the district, or moving a structure outside of the district boundaries.
Relocation of a structure from its original site is akin to demolition of the building in its original context. Relocation shall only be considered after it is determined that to remain in its original location would result in the structure's complete demolition. The relocation of a building from the BDO to a site outside the boundaries of the district is considered equal to demolition, because the structure is no longer subject to design review and protection of the design review board.
The relocation of a building from outside the boundaries of the BDO to a site within the district shall be evaluated in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this manual. A structure may be relocated into the district if it possesses similar architectural character in terms of period, style, height, scale, material, and texture, to nearby existing structures. A structure may be moved from one site to another in the district if the following conditions are met:
•
The integrity of the location and setting of the building in its original location has been lost or is seriously threatened;
•
The new location will be similar in setting and site;
•
The structure will be compatible with the buildings adjacent to the new location in style, height, scale, materials and setback; and
•
The relocation of the building will not result in a negative visual impact on the site and surrounding structures from which it will be removed.
2.
Demolition criteria.
Historic buildings are irreplaceable community assets. As such, the demolition of a building that contributes historically or architecturally to the district shall be avoided.
Demolition of a building will not be allowed if:
•
The building is of architectural or historical interest and value or its removal would be detrimental to the character of the district; or
•
The building is of old, unusual, or uncommon design and materials, and it could not be reproduced without great difficulty and expense; or
•
A proposed replacement would not make a positive visual contribution to the district, would disrupt the character of the district or would be visually incompatible.
Demolition of a building may only be allowed if:
•
The building has lost its architectural and historical integrity, and its removal will not result in a negative, less appropriate visual effect on the district; or
•
The property owner can prove that the building:
º
Is a threat to the safety of the public, or
º
Cannot be reasonably rehabilitated either structurally or economically.
It is the applicant's responsibility to successfully demonstrate that a building is a candidate for demolition. In order to document the building's structural condition, the design review board may:
a.
Require a site visit by design review board members and/or county staff to more closely inspect and evaluate the building.
b.
Require the applicant submit an unbiased structural engineering report that documents the building's physical condition.
c.
Require the applicant to submit an economic and structural feasibility study for rehabilitating or reusing the structure.
d.
Require the applicant to submit a feasibility study for the relocation of the building as an alternative to demolition.
e.
Require the testimony of expert witnesses at the public hearing at which the demolition request is being considered.
Prior to the approval of any demolition of a primary building or structure, the applicant is required to provide for the Design Review Board's consideration, prior to approval of the demolition application, plans for the building or buildings that will be located on the site of the demolished building. The new construction project must comply with the guidelines set forth in this manual.
3.
Demolition by neglect.
Demolition by neglect refers to the process of deterioration that occurs when routine maintenance or major repair is not performed to the extent that future use or rehabilitation is jeopardized. Demolition by neglect is also a threat to public health and safety, and shall not be an acceptable alternative to a design review board denial of a demolition request. If it is found that demolition by neglect is occurring, the property shall be referred to the code enforcement officer.
GLOSSARY
Addition: A non-original element placed onto an existing building, site or structure.
Alteration: Any act or process which changes the exterior architectural appearance of a building.
Appropriate: Suitable to or compatible with what exists. Proposed work on historic properties is evaluated for appropriateness during the design review process.
Appurtenance: In general, appurtenances include without limitation, appendages to the original structure such as: additions, mechanical systems, covered walkways, satellite dishes and antennae, storage buildings, attached parking decks, etc. In site planning, the term appurtenance may be applied to access roads and parking areas as well.
Buffer: Landscape area which forms a linear stretch abutting a property line, pavement or structures.
Build line: The line indicating structural improvement on the property (building, parking, etc.) closest to the property line. The build line shall be drawn parallel to the front property line.
Certificate of design review: A document required prior to a building permit, approving an application to make an alteration or a material change in the appearance of a property or of a structure, site, or work-of-art located in the bypass design overlay (BDO) district. Possession of a certificate of design review does not remove any responsibility on the part of the property owner to acquire a building permit prior to beginning the project.
Character: The individual qualities of buildings, sites and districts that differentiate and distinguish them from other buildings, sites and districts.
Compatible: Not detracting from surrounding elements, buildings, sites or structures; appropriate given what already exists.
Component: An individual part of a building, site or district.
Contemporary: Of the current period; modern.
Context: The setting in which a historic element or building exists.
Connectivity: Development achieves "connectivity" when one or more land uses and parcels within the development have direct accommodations for both vehicles and/or pedestrians to travel between or among those land uses, and direct vehicular and pedestrian connections with compatible land uses on abutting properties. Direct accommodations for vehicles means that there is one or more alley, road, or driveway connections between the uses on the development site and among compatible uses on abutting sites (parcels), so that a vehicle can exit one development and enter the other development (i.e. cross property lines) without existing onto a public street that provides principal access to the developments. Direct accommodations for pedestrians' means that there are one or more sidewalks or other approved paths that allow a pedestrian to go from one development or parcel to another without using the sidewalk along a public street that provides principal access to the developments.
Demolition: Any act or process that destroys a structure in part or in whole.
Design review board: Reviews the architectural and site planning considerations and improvements proposed within the bypass design overlay district.
District: The area identified on the Official Zoning Map of Jones County.
Element: An individual defining feature of a building, structure, site or district.
Exterior architectural feature: The architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior of a structure, including, but not limited to: texture of the building material; type and style of all windows, doors, and signs; and other related architectural fixtures, features, details, or elements.
Fenestration: The spatial definition of the walls of a building. The facade of a building establishes a wall surface or plane. The degree to which that plane is visually segmented by bays and punctured by entrances and windows is fenestration. For example, historic commercial buildings have a high degree of fenestration and large, modern "big-box" sprawl stores have an extremely low degree of fenestration.
Historic site: A site worthy of protection or preservation, designated as historic for its historic, cultural, archaeological, or aesthetic value.
Historic structure: A structure worthy of preservation, designated as historic for its historic, cultural, archaeological, architectural, or aesthetic value.
House type: A definition based on floor plan, height and sometimes roof shape, having nothing to do with architectural style. Most houses that fall into a particular type are of vernacular design, meaning that their designs are based on regional tradition and utilize regional materials.
Infill: New construction within a historic district, generally situated on the site of a demolished structure but possibly on a site never previously developed.
Interior: Landscaping areas within or partially within pavement areas for breaking up large expanses of pavement. Interior landscape areas include islands, peninsulas, or combinations thereof.
Island: An interior landscaping area surrounded by pavement or structures.
Landmark: A building, structure, object or site worthy of preservation, designated as historic for its historic, cultural, archaeological, architectural, or aesthetic value.
Landscape, frontage: Landscape areas between a building and adjacent to street(s).
Landscape, perimeter: Landscape area located between the side and rear of a building and its adjacent property line(s), not adjacent to any street(s).
Maintenance: Routine care for a building, structure or site that does not involve design alterations.
Material change in appearance: The construction of a new structure, or a change that will affect the exterior architectural features of any structure, site, or work of art within the BDO district. Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on a structure that does not involve a change in design not a "material change in appearance." Material change in appearance includes without limitation any one or more of the following:
•
A reconstruction or alteration of the size, shape, or facade of a structure, including without limitation, relocation of any doors or windows, or removal or alteration of any architectural features, details, or elements;
•
Demolition of a structure;
•
Relocation of a structure within the BDO district or from a location outside the BDO district to a location within the BDO district;
•
Commencement of excavation, grading or site improvement;
•
A change in the location of advertising visible from the public way on the property; or
•
The erection, alteration, restoration, or removal of any structure within the BDO district, including walls, fences, steps, and pavements, or other related features.
Neglect: Failure to care for a property in such a manner as to prevent its deterioration. Neglect is often not intentional, but can lead to very serious deterioration of materials and even structural systems.
New construction: The construction of a new element, building, structure, or landscape component; new construction involves the introduction of designs not original to the building, structure or site.
Ordinary repair and maintenance: Work done to prevent deterioration or to replace parts of a building, structure, sign or exterior architectural feature with equivalent materials in order to correct any deterioration, decay of or damage to any such building, structure, sign or exterior architectural feature. Ordinary maintenance or repair work shall not exceed 25 percent of the structure's assessed value in any 24 consecutive month period.
Ornamentation: Decorative elements applied to a structure.
Orientation: The direction a building's primary elevation (also known as facade) faces.
Pedestrian-friendly: A term which refers to development and features of developments that are designed with an emphasis primarily on the street sidewalk and on pedestrian access to the site and building, rather than an exclusive focus on auto access and parking. Buildings are generally placed close to a street, and the main entrance is oriented to a street or sidewalk. Building facades and other development features along a street are oriented and scaled to the pedestrian.
Preservation: The process of taking steps to sustain the form, details and integrity of a property essentially as it presently exists. Preservation may involve the elimination of deterioration and structural damage, but does not involve reconstruction to any significant degree.
Reconstruction: The process of reproducing the exact form of a component, building, structure or site that existed at some time in the past.
Rehabilitation: The process of returning a building to a state of utility while retaining those elements essential to its architectural, historical and/or aesthetic significance.
Repair: Any minor change to a property that is not construction, removal, demolition or alteration and that does not result in a material change in appearance.
Restoration: The process of returning a building to its appearance at an earlier time (though not necessarily to its original appearance). Restoration involves the removal of later additions and the replacement of missing components and details.
Setting: The immediate physical environment of a building, structure, site or district.
Significant: Possessing importance to a particular building, structure, site or district; essential to maintaining the full integrity of a particular building, structure, site or district.
Site: A place or plot of land where an event occurred or where some object was or is located.
Stabilization: Maintaining a building as it exists today by making it structurally safe.
Streetscape: All physical elements that can be viewed along a street.
Structure: Anything constructed or erected which has, or the use of which requires, permanent or temporary location on or in the ground, or which is attached to something having a permanent location on the ground, including but not limited to, the following: buildings, gazebos, signs, billboards, tennis courts, radio and television antennae and satellite dishes (including supporting towers), swimming pools, light fixtures, walls, fences and steps.
Style: Showing the influence of shapes, materials, detailing or other features associated with a particular architectural style.
Setback: The distance from the property line to the building (including roof overhangs, foundations, porches, etc.). The front setback may encompass landscaped or paved areas, building appurtenances, etc.
Sidewalk clear zone: The portion of a continuous sidewalk located immediately contiguous to the street furniture and tree planting zone reserved for pedestrian circulation and passage and unobstructed by any permanent objects to a height of eight feet. No fixed elements, including traffic control boxes or other utility structures, shall be placed above ground in the clear zone. The clear zone shall have a consistent cross-slope not exceeding two percent.
Street furniture and tree planting zone: The portion of continuous sidewalk located immediately adjacent to the curb reserved for the placement of street trees and street furniture including utility-and-light poles, waste-receptacles, fire hydrants, traffic signs, traffic control boxes, newspaper boxes, transit shelters, bicycle racks, seating and similar elements in a manner that does not obstruct pedestrian access or motorist visibility. Such elements, where installed, shall be a type specified by the zoning enforcement officer in accordance with uniform design standards utilized for the placement of such objects in the public right-of-way.
Street trees: All newly planted street trees shall be a minimum caliper of three inches measured 36 inches above the ground, shall be a minimum of 12 feet in height, shall have a minimum mature height of 40 feet and shall be limbed up to a minimum height of seven feet. Trees shall have a minimum planting area of 40 square feet planted with evergreen ground cover such as, mondo grass or liriope spicata or covered with hardwood mulch.

Street furniture: Those features associated with a street that are intended to enhance the street's physical character and are used by pedestrians, such as benches, bus shelters, trash receptacles, planting containers, pedestrian lighting, kiosks, etc. Advertising on street furniture is not allowed.
Streetscape: The appearance and organization along a street of paving, plantings, street hardware, street furniture and miscellaneous structures.
Through-street: A public or private street within a large-parcel redevelopment that connects a transit corridor to (a) another public or private street within a large parcel development; (b) a public or private street abutting the site; or (c) another property with through-access to another public or private street.
Spacing: The distance between buildings located on adjoining parcels (including both side setbacks).
Vernacular: Based on regional tradition and utilizing regional materials. Also an architectural style exemplifying the commonest building techniques based on the forms and materials of a particular historical period, region, or group of people.
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation.
1.
A property will be used as it was historically, or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships.
2.
The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided.
3.
Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, will not be undertaken.
4.
Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved.
5.
Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved.
6.
Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture, and where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.
7.
Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used.
8.
Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.
9.
New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment.
10.
New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
The National Park Service also publishes Preservation Briefs, technical bulletins which provide detailed information for all types of projects and which are written in accordance with the Secretary's Standards. Over 40 subjects are covered in the briefs, which are available online at www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/briefs/presbhom.htm.
The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Illustrated Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing Historic Buildings is a government publication and is available from the Government Printing Office (GPO) at www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/tpscat.htm or by calling the GPO at 866-512-1800 (toll-free).
Photo Guide of Encouraged Design Standards
Site Planning
Recommended: Larger-scale uses are set further back, with small buildings close to the roads. Combined with landscaping, it creates an enclosed, pedestrian friendly feel.
Not Recommended: Most buildings are further back, and parking spaces are not screened by either trees, landscaping, or other buildings. This increases difficulty of pedestrian access and detracts from the surrounding landscape.
Recommended: Buildings have a limited setback, and majority of parking is found in the rear of the building. This creates a pedestrian-friendly atmosphere and helps calm traffic along side roads.
Not Recommended: Again, parking creates a barrier between the main thoroughfare and stores, inhibiting pedestrian movement. Parking spaces are also unscreened, which harms the aesthetic qualities of the area.
Parking & Landscaping
Recommended: Landscaping breaks up the monotony of the asphalt parking spaces and helps to obscure view of vehicles.
Not Recommended: Parking lot is monotonous and unsightly. There is no variety in landscape or scenery, and does not contribute to the environment in any way.
Recommended: Landscaped walkway facilitates the safe and efficient pedestrian movement between cars and stores, while also serving an aesthetic purpose.
Not Recommended: While crosswalks give guidance to pedestrians, they are left vulnerable to automobile traffic, creating a major safety risk.
Façade Design
Recommended: Storefront is broken up by windows, doors, and other architectural features. Brick is the primary façade material, and non-trademark architecture is used.
Not Recommended: Trademark architecture dominates, and a vast wall is present with no features to reinforce the human scale. Stucco is the primary façade material.
Recommended: Storefront has variance and front façade has emphasis on multiple levels. Brick and stone are also incorporated to façade.
Not Recommended: Little variance in front façade, and despite having two stories, there is only one elevation of façade visible in addition to the cornice.
Recommended: Franchise architecture and logos are incorporated unobtrusively, and signage does not distract from building. Fence also increases aesthetic appeal.
Not Recommended: Large pole sign contributes to visual clutter, and franchise architecture makes it indistinguishable from other locations.
