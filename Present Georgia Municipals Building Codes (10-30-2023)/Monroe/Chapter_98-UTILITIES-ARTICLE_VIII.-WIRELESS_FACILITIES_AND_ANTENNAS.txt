ARTICLE VIII. - WIRELESS FACILITIES AND ANTENNAS

Sec. 98-227. - Purpose and compliance.
(a)
O.C.G.A. § 32-4-92(a)(10) authorizes the city, a municipality organized and existing under the laws and authorities of the State of Georgia (the "city") to establish reasonable regulations for the installation, construction, maintenance, renewal, removal, and relocation of pipes, mains, conduits, cables, wires, poles, towers, traffic and other signals, and other equipment, facilities, or appliances in, on, along, over, or under the public roads of the city. Further, 47 U.S.C. § 253(c) provides that the city has authority to manage its public rights of way. Finally, the Georgia Streamlining Wireless Facilities and Antennas Act., O.C.G.A. Title 36, Chapter 66C (the "SWFAA"), addresses the placement of small wireless facilities in the public rights of way of the city.
(b)
The city finds it is in the best interest of the city and its residents and businesses to establish requirements, specifications and reasonable conditions regarding placement of small wireless facilities, and poles in the public rights of way. These requirements, specifications and conditions are adopted in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the residents and businesses of the city and to reasonably manage and protect the public rights of way and its uses in the city.
(c)
The objective of this article is to (i) implement the SWFAA and (ii) ensure use of the public rights of way is consistent with the design, appearance and other features of nearby land uses, protects the integrity of historic, cultural and scenic resources and does not harm residents' quality of life.
