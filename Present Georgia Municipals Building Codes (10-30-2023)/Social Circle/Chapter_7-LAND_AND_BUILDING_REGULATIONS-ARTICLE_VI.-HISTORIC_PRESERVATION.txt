(g)
Acceptable commission reaction to applications for certificate of appropriateness.
Commission action: The commission may approve the certificate of appropriateness as proposed, approve the certificate of appropriateness with any modifications it deems necessary, table until a date certain, or reject it, as described more particularly below:
Approval with conditions. If the commission identifies elements of a proposed material change in appearance not in compliance with the criteria, the commission may make recommendations or set such conditions and/or changes which render the application for a certificate of appropriateness in compliance, avoiding a substantial adverse effect on the historic, aesthetic or architectural significance or value of the designated historic property or designated historic district. If the applicant agrees to such conditions and/or changes, the commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness.
Table/withdrawal. If the commission is unable to make an informed decision because it finds the application incomplete, the required support materials insufficient, or the applicant unavailable to answer pertinent queries, the commission shall table the application for not more than seven days and give the applicant the opportunity to provide the required additional information. If the applicant fails to submit the requested information within the seven-day period, the application is to be considered withdrawn without prejudice. The applicant, if desired, may resubmit the application for the next regular meeting.
Denial. When considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall deny the application if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance is not in compliance with the criteria and will have a substantial adverse effect on the historic, aesthetic or architectural significance or value of the designated historic property or designated historic district. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
Approval. The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds the proposed material change(s) in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, and the historical and architectural value and significance of the property, the following factors for each of the following acts:
Reconstruction, alteration, new construction or renovation: The commission shall issue certificates of appropriateness for the above proposed actions if those actions conform in design, scale, building materials, setback and site features with the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood, and with the secretary of interior's standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings.
Relocation: A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the relocation of a building, structure, or object shall be guided by:
(1)
The historic character and aesthetic interest the building, structure or object contributes to its present setting.
(2)
Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area.
(3)
Whether the building, structure or object can be moved without significant damage to its structural integrity.
(4)
Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, structure, site or object.
Demolition. The commission shall not approve applications for a COA for demolition without first reviewing post-demolition plans. The commission shall approve or deny applications for a COA for demolition consistent with the criteria below. Before an approved COA for demolition becomes effective, notice of said approved COA for demolition shall be given as follows: historic, two months and non-historic, two months. Notice shall be posted on the premises of the building or structure approved for demolition in a location clearly visible from the street. The purpose of this section is to further the purposes of this chapter by preserving historic buildings, structures and objects which are important to the education, culture, traditions and the economic values of the city and to give the city's interested persons, historical societies or organizations the opportunity to acquire or to arrange for the preservation of such buildings, structures and objects. After such two-month delay period, the approved certificate of appropriateness for demolition shall become effective, in which event demolition may commence without further delay. A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, sites, trees judged to be 50 years old or older, or objects, shall be guided by:
(1)
The historic, scenic or architectural significance of the building, structure, site, tree or object.
(2)
The importance of the building, structure, site, tree, or object to the character of a district.
(3)
The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure, site, tree, or object because of its design, texture, material, detail, or unique location.
(4)
Whether the building, structure, site, tree, or object is one of the last remaining examples in the neighborhood or the city.
(5)
Whether there are definite plans for use of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area.
(6)
Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, site, tree, or object from collapse.
(7)
Whether the building, structure, site, tree, or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value.
(h)
Undue hardship. When, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in reviewing applications, shall have the power to reasonably vary or modify strict provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided, however, that such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural and historical integrity and character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making.
(i)
Deadline for approval or rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the proper filing thereof by the owner or occupant of a historic property, or of a building structure, site, or object located within a historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by united states mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission. Failure of the commission to act within said 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed.
(j)
Necessary action by commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued.
(k)
Requirement of conformance with certificate of appropriateness. All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. In the event work is performed not in accordance with such certificate, the commission shall issue a cease and desist order and all work shall cease. The commission and the council shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic property or historic district, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district.
(l)
Certificate of appropriateness void if construction not commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six months of date of issuance. Certificate of appropriateness shall be issued for a period of 12 months and are renewable.
(m)
Recording an application for certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness, and all the commission's proceedings in connection with said application.

(o)
Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the council. Any such appeal must be filed with the council within 30 days after the issuance of the determination pursuant to this section or, in the case of a failure of the commission to act, within 30 days of the expiration of the 45-day period allowed for the commission action pursuant to this section. The council may approve, modify, or reject the determination made by the commission, if the governing body finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. Appeals from decisions of the council may be taken to the superior court of Walton County in the manner provided by law for appeals from conviction for City Code violations.

(a)
Ordinary maintenance and repair.

The building official shall prepare a condition assessment for the commission.
(f)
Notice and remedy time allowance.

The owner of the property will have 30 days from the receipt of such notice to begin the steps necessary to remedy the situation, and shall have 90 days from receipt of the notice to complete the work, unless such time shall be extended due to the expense and/or complexity of the repairs. In no event shall such extension exceed 90 additional days.
(g)
