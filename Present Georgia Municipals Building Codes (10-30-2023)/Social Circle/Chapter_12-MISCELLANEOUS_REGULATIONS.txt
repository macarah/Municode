A permit is required to sell alcohol on the sidewalk as set forth below.
(d)
Temporary closing of sidewalk cafes.
(1)
Sidewalk cafes may be ordered closed temporarily by the city whenever deemed necessary in the sole discretion of the city, whenever the area may be needed for a public purpose, including but not limited to construction, maintenance, public health, safety or welfare, emergencies, and public events such as parades or street parties.

Such cleaning may include pressure cleaning. If the area is not maintained in a neat and orderly appearance after notice, the city may then take steps necessary to place the property in a neat and clean order and charge the operator with the reasonable cost of cleaning or repairs. Such action by the city does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the city for any damages to the property if such cleaning or repairs were completed in good faith.

This coverage shall not be less than $500,000.00 per occurrence.
(3)
It shall not be lawful to operate a sidewalk cafe at any time the insurance required by this section is not maintained and evidence of its continuance filed with the city.

(j)
Right to limit or deny admission or service. Within the designated area of a cafe, the operator holding a permit under this section shall have the right to limit access and occupancy to only bona fide paying customers of that operator's restaurant who are behaving in a lawful manner.
(k)
Penalties. In addition to losing the privilege of operating a sidewalk cafe, any person, firm, corporation or agent, servant, employee, officer or contractor for any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision, requirement, term, or condition of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and each day of such violation shall constitute a separate offense. The performance of any act prohibited by any section or provision of this section, or the failure to perform any act required thereby, shall constitute a violation and an offense hereunder and any person found guilty of a violation of any section or provision of this section shall be punished as provided under the jurisdiction of the municipal court of the city and may be punished with a fine up to $1,000.00 and as set forth in other provision of this Code.

To prepare and provide for the necessary forms for the application for a permit and for the submission of any required information as may be necessary to properly administer and enforce the provisions of this article;
(2)
To review the application for completeness, collect whatever fees may be required, designate or coordinate sites and set time schedules, and, where appropriate, receive the approval of the state department of transportation, state highway patrol, and the sheriff of Walton County or a representative of the city department of public safety, or any other necessary public officer, for the requested activity; and
(3)
To issue to the private organization or group of private persons a permit within ten days of such approval. The city manager may, however, when he deems it appropriate for the public health, safety and welfare, defer the issuance of a permit until the application for same shall have been approved by the council.
(c)
Other officer(s) to make recommendation to city manager.

(d)
Manager to act on application or forward to council. Upon the receipt of the recommendation of the reviewing officer as hereinabove provided, or upon the receipt of the application if no reviewing officer is designated, the city manager shall take action upon the recommendation and application, although when he deems it appropriate for the public health, safety and welfare he may refer the same to the council for consideration and action at its next public meeting.

(f)
City manager may designate sites, set time schedules, etc. Where more than one permit is sought for the same date or where the proposed route would result in interference as described in subsection (e) above, the city manager shall have the authority to designate reasonable sites and/or routes and set time schedules for the beginning and ending of the activity. The city manager shall have authority to cancel the permit where the activity fails to begin within a reasonable time after the time set for it to begin based on other activities for which permits have been granted or based on the unreasonable interference caused by such delay with the public welfare, peace, safety, health, good order and convenience to the general public.
(g)
Manager to issue permit. Once the applicant submits his application per this article, and once the city manager completes the permit issuance procedures described in this article, the city manager shall issue a permit to the applicant, which permit shall state the nature of the activity authorized and bear the date of issuance and the signature of the city manager.
(Former § 12-002(4.))

(b)
Security deposit for event. After examining the application and receiving the advice and assistance of any other officer named herein, the manager, after consideration of the facts reported in the application and any such advice and assistance from another public officer as herein provided, including prior experiences involving the same or similar activity, may require, as a condition for the issuance of the permit, that a fee be paid in an amount reasonably necessary to provide for, among other things, clean up after the event, special first aid or medical resources, security for vehicles at any staging area, special traffic considerations, toilet facilities, and similar special expenses occasioned by the activity. This amount shall not exceed $1,000.00.
(c)
Special sanitation, medical and other provisions for event may be required. As a condition to issuing a permit, the city manager may require the organization or group to provide personnel for trash cleanup of affected areas littered during the activity for which a permit is sought, the provision of first aid and medical resources if considered necessary by the city manager, proof of sufficient storage areas for a large influx of motor vehicles occasioned by the permitted activity, provision of temporary toilet facilities and other similar special and extraordinary items considered to be necessary for the permitted activity in the opinion of the city manager, which may be based on any past experience with such activities and any coordination with other governmental employees and officials. In no event shall the city manager require private organizations or groups of private persons engaging in a parade to provide personnel for normal governmental functions, such as traffic control and police protection. If additional requirements are placed on organizations or groups in accordance with this subsection, and those requirements are not met, then said failure to comply with the requirements shall be grounds for denial of any subsequent permit requested by said organization or group and for any claims for funds expended by the city for those expenses agreed to but not provided by the applicant.
(d)
Individuals may be excused from security deposit requirements. If the organization be other than individuals, a permit will not be issued without the making of the necessary deposit; individuals may be excused from such a deposit on account of indigence upon execution under oath by the individual applicant, or by each individual in a group applying for a permit, of a pauper's affidavit. Prior to receipt of such an affidavit, the city manager shall advise the applicant orally or in writing of the penalties for the execution of a false document.
