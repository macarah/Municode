This prohibition shall be posted with appropriate signage so as to apprise drivers of trucks that such trucks are prohibited in areas designated "No Through Trucks". The signage shall be in proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Any law enforcement officer or code enforcement officer to whom law enforcement authority has been designated who observes a motor vehicle being operated upon a public road of the state and who has reason to believe that any provision hereof is being violated is authorized to stop such vehicle and make investigation of such.
Exemption. Trucks making a delivery to an address on the "No Through Trucks" road, with documentation proving such delivery, are permitted on the "No Through Trucks" road solely for that limited purpose, and shall depart by the shortest route to a road that is not designated "No Through Trucks".
