Sec. 30-29. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to [O.C.G.A.] § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2);
(15)
Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer.
a.
No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c).
(e)
The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
(Ord. No. 2010-010, 6-14-10)
Sec. 30-30. - Application/permit process.
(a)
General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.
(b)

The Mountain Creek Reservoir (SCS Structure 11) is located in Banks County, Georgia, and owned by Banks County. The reservoir is a soil conservation service rural water supply structure, and water is supplied to Banks County based on storage between specified elevations. The Grove Creek Reservoir is located in Banks County, Georgia and owned by the city. The reservoir is a soil conservation service flood control structure, and water is supplied to the city based on storage between specified elevations. The purpose of this watershed protection plan is to establish criteria pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 for the protection of drinking water watersheds. This protection is necessary for the enhancement of public health, safety and welfare as well as to assure that surface sources of drinking water are of high quality in order to be treated to meet all state and federal drinking water standards. The criteria set forth accomplish this by establishing buffer zones around streams and by specifying allowable impervious surface densities within the identified watersheds.
(b)
Secondary objectives are to:
(1)
Manage the reservoir and its drainage area in a manner that will conserve the basic resources of air, soil, and water.
(2)
Provide for diverse and viable plant, animal, and fish communities.
(3)
Give special consideration for the protection of threatened and endangered plant and animal species.
(4)
Manage the reservoir to properly establish, enhance, and maintain acceptable fish and wildlife habitat, aesthetic quality, and sustain natural environmental conditions.
(5)
Manage use of the reservoir in a manner that provides the least environmental impact.
(6)
Provide for the protection of public land and water.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 98-8, §§ I—XI, adopted Nov. 23, 1998, did not specifically amend the Code; hence inclusion as art. VI, §§ 30-181—30-191, was at the editor's discretion.

Sec. 30-181. - System management.
Water produced at the water plant from 1991 to 1994 is indicated in Table 1. In Table 2 are records for a 12-month period indicating raw, produced, sold and unaccounted.
(1)
Unaccounted for water. The city has averaged per month a total of 344,658 gpd of unaccounted for water or 39.2 percent of total water produced from January, 1994, to December, 1994. The city has discovered in April, 1995, a bypass water connection to the Banks County Water System. A meter was in place; however, only a portion of the total amount used was registered. Banks County water use averaged 800,000 to 900,000 gallons per month in 1994.
Since the discovery and disconnection of the bypass piping, the average daily reading indicated a total of 83,000 gallons was used by Banks County. The monthly average of water produced and water sold by the city in 1994 is 37.225 million gallons and 26.74 million gallons respectively. Using the most recent metered flow to Banks County, less the average monthly billing, the corrected monthly usage by Banks County is 1.7 million gallons. Thus, the average corrected UAW for 1994 is 23.6 percent.
The filter plant uses an average of 7.5 percent water (as detailed in subsection 30-182(b)). Fire fighting and hydrant flushing account for approximately 1.6 percent of water produced. Therefore, the corrected 1994 UAW average is about 14.5 percent. Please refer to Table 1 and Table 2.
(2)
UAW elimination programs.
a.
Leak detection and elimination. The city currently performs leak detection activity by visually checking main water lines. Additional leak detection and elimination measures include the calibration of all meters greater than two inches in size that are three years or older. Random sampling of water meters by selecting one per 25 customers to establish meter types, age of meter and recalibration to determine loss of water. The city also maintains a meter change-out program, whereby old meters are exchanged for recalibrated meters every five to seven years.
b.
Water distribution system map. The city maintains accurate water distribution maps of the entire system.
c.
Meter maintenance. The city maintains an active program of testing and calibration of all water meters. Testing procedures shall be as follows:
TESTING
1.
All valves shall be tested at the point of manufacture and made driptight when tested under the hydrostatic head specified. After the valves are set in place and are grove to operate, the city shall test them under the rated working pressure and conditions and any valve found to leak shall be made watertight or airtight and if found to be of faulty design shall be satisfactorily repaired or replaced by the city.
2.
Existing nontouch meters shall be tested in the field as directed by the engineer and/or owner. In addition, existing nontouch meters may be removed and replaced without testing as directed by the engineer and/or owner. Field testing will compare the customer meter to a calibrated meter (a meter that is certified to be accurate) registration. A meter test kit shall include the following:
(a)
A calibrated meter;
(b)
Meter yokes;
(c)
An on-off valve;
(d)
A flow rate control valve;
(e)
A meter jumper;
(f)
Calibration curves; and
(g)
A supply hose.
Before testing meter make sure the meter is located where splashing water will not cause any property damage.
Examine the customer's meter. Make sure that the meter is the correct model and that it is installed in the correct direction. The city will notify customers in writing three days before their service will be interrupted.
Setting up for the test shall be as follows:
1.
Turn off the water flow to the meter.
2.
Remove the customer's meter.
3.
Attach a hose to the water supply and flush briefly.
4.
Connect the supply hose to the calibrated meter.
5.
Install the customer's meter downstream from the test meter to avoid sediment damage to the calibrated meter.
6.
Connect the drain hose to the customer's meter.
Performing the field test:
1.
Turn on the supply, the on-off valve, and open the flow rate valve. Flush briefly to be sure all air is removed form the lines.
2.
Look for problems with the customer's meter.
3.
Adjust the flow rate with the flow rate valve to two gpm (gallons per minute). Time it for one minute to get the correct flow.
4.
Close the on-off valve when the hand on the calibrated meter reaches "o."
5.
Record the exact reading on the customer's meter.
6.
Open the on-off valve. Allow ten gallons to run through the calibrated meter, then close the on-off valve immediately. Check the accuracy of the meter. For ten gallons, each mark on the dial equals 1.0 percent accuracy.
7.
Repeat the test for 15 gpm. Allow 100 gallons to run through the meter. This will take about seven minutes. The hand should make ten complete revolutions. Check the accuracy of the meter. For 100 gallons, each mark on the dial equals 0.1 percent accuracy.
8.
Repeat the test for one-quarter gpm. Allow ten gallons to run through the meter. This will take about 40 minutes.
The city shall record all three tests and determine the percent accuracy for each test. This information shall be given to the water superintendent for evaluation and determination of which meters are defective and need replacement. The city shall be sure to identify each meter location by address or other means acceptable to the water superintendent.
d.
Tank overflow. The 1.5-gallon storage tanks have altitude valves, thereby preventing inadvertent tank overflows.
e.
Flushing programs. The city will utilize a flushing program for fire hydrants and fire lines. The program shall be accomplished by a comprehensive flushing of the water distribution system, including fire lines on an annual basis. The program may be supplemented by additional flushing as necessary. The flushing program shall encompass the following steps:
1.
Begin at the supply source working at the first hydrant in the system. Flow water through the streamer nozzle for a duration long enough to empty the pipe section between the source and the hydrant or until the water is clear.
2.
Proceed to the next hydrant in line. If a branch line extends from the main line between the two hydrants, close the valves to those branch lines until the main line is flushed. Do not close the first hydrant completely until the second hydrant is opened. Flow water through the hydrant as described in step 1.
3.
Continue the flushing of all lines moving in a direction away form the supply source until all line sections have been flushed.
f.
Unauthorized use. No person is allowed to use water from any unmetered distribution source.
g.
Unmetered service connections. There are no unmetered service connections.
(3)
Interconnections of distribution system. There are three interconnections for the sale of water from the city: One with Banks County, one with Jackson County, and the other to the City of Maysville. A copy of the Agreement is provided in Appendix A1 and A2 [on file in the office of the city clerk].
(4)
Additional system management activities. The city maintains a variety of programs designed to aid in the detection of leaks, maintenance and replacement of water meters and water system flushing. It is the desire of the city that each of these programs help to reduce the amount of unaccounted for water loss each month by a goal of ten percent. A ten percent reduction in UAW would result in approximately ten MG per month reduction in produced water. This goal can be achieved by effective monitoring of the water system through:
a.
Reporting all leaks to the water superintendent immediately and isolating the leak by closing appropriate valves.
b.
Preventative repairs and upgrades to the system.
c.
Scheduled meter testing and replacement.
d.
Scheduled hydrant and line flushing.
e.
Efficient water plant operation.

  New meters were added in 1973 to measure finished water and backwash water. In 1974, a new meter was added to measure water used by the laboratory, chemical feeders, restroom, etc. These meters were added by the city in order to study and deep track of in-plant water use. Filter loss of head and rate of flow indicators were replaced in 1993 in order to provide information to reduce the frequency of backwashing. One pair (two filters) were cleaned, filter bottoms inspected and the media replaced in April 1995. The city is requesting a high rate for those filters and to subsequently rehab the other pair of filters. This should reduce the frequency of filter backwashing.

Average residential GPD per capita. The population for the city in 1990 was 4,108. The Northeast Georgia Regional Development Center has projected the future population growth based on the average annual percentage growth rate which occurred from 1980 to 1988 will continue through the year 2020. Applying an annual growth rate of 1.5 percent, the population of the city will be 6,409 in the year 2020.
In 1994 the estimated city population was 4,358 as projected by the Northeast Georgia Regional Development Center (NGRDC). Assuming that all residents receive water service from the City, and including those residents served in Jackson County it is estimated that 809,886 gallons per day of water were consumed in 1994 by residents. This equates into approximately 155.1 gallons per day per capita consumed.

Sec. 30-190. - Long range planning.
Water conservation for long term water demand and supply planning:
(1)
Per capita projections. In general, per capita water use increases as an area urbanizes. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, this increase is around one gpcd per year in the southeast. However, water conservation efforts such as use of ultra-low flow plumbing fixtures that encourage conservation has recently been implemented. To account for these and future water conservation efforts, it was estimated that the increase in per capita usage would be 0.5 gpcd per year. The increase in per capita use of 0.5 gpcd/year results in a per capita rate of 167.6 gpcd in year 2020.
(2)
Population projections/population served. From previous reports the population projections for Jackson County and the city are as follows:
EXPAND

2010 52,300 5,522
2015 55,300 5,949
2020 69,700 6,409
  In 1995, the total persons served from residential meters is estimated to be: City of Commerce, 4,423; unincorporated Jackson County, 864. This equates to a total of 5,287 persons in 1995.
In the future, all persons in the City of Commerce and Milner will continue to be served, plus an estimated increase in unincorporated Jackson County. Please refer to Table 5.
(3)
Water use projections. It is assumed the city's unaccounted for water (UAW) in the future will be by a factor of ten percent (see subsection 30-181(4)). As efforts are made to reduce this rate, additional age of pipes may result in additional leaks. The following notes and assumptions are made to project future water consumed.
a.
City of Commerce.
1.
Population to be served as shown in Table 5.
2.
GPCD to increase 0.5 gpd as discussed in subsection (1) above.
b.
Banks County. Banks County used an average of 8.8 percent of all water in 1994. This compares to about 10.1 percent of all water sold to inside and outside customers of the city. It is assumed that Banks County will remain using water at the same rate of 10.1 percent of water sold in the city.
c.
City of Maysville. The City of Maysville water consumption fluctuates throughout the year. In 1994, Maysville consumed approximately 3.5 percent of all water sold. Compared to water sold to inside and outside customers of the city, it is about four percent. It is assumed that the City of Maysville will remain using water at the same rate of four percent of water sold in the city.
d.
Jackson County. Commerce begin selling water to Jackson County for redistribution and resale by Jackson County in 1995 at a minimum rate of 50,000 gallons per day. It is assumed that this would increase at five percent annually.
Presented in Table 6 are water consumed (sold) projections. Presented in Table 7 are water produced and water withdrawn projections, based upon factored water sold volumes as indicated in Table 7.
In summary, the 20-year projected maximum month daily withdrawal rate is 2.5 MGD. The peak day during this month is estimated to be 3.75 MGD.

ARTICLE VII. - DROUGHT CONTINGENCY PLAN[8]

Footnotes:
--- (8) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 98-9, §§ I—IV, adopted Nov. 23, 1998, did not specifically amend the Code; hence inclusion as art. VII, §§ 30-211—30-214, was at the editor's discretion.

Sec. 30-211. - Drought conditions.
(a)
Drought indicators.
(1)
Streamflow levels. Streamflow levels do not apply in this project.
(2)
Groundwater levels. Groundwater levels do not apply in this project.
(3)
Reservoir storage or levels. Reservoir water surface levels will be monitoried to determine storage available for water supply, using a U.S.G.S. staff gauge or equivalent. A drought will defined as any decrease in available water supply such that the Grove Creek Reservoir's pool elevation is less than elevation 695.6 for 72 hours or more, based on a 4.2 MGD average daily withdrawal rate. This elevation is equal to the low water surface level for 1954 drought conditions under a 4.2 MGD average daily withdrawal rate. It is estimated that a pool level of 695.6 the reservoir water suupply allocation can only supply 30 additional days of water at a 4.2 MGD rate is drought conditions persist.
The city will phase drought restrictions based on a certain level drop in the reservoir pool elevation. At such time as the reservoir pool elevation drops one foot from elevation 697.6 (normal pool) to 696.6. for 72 hours, the city will implement Level One drought restrictions. When the pool elevation drops to 695.6 for 72 hours, the city will enact Level Two drought restrictions.
(4)
Drought restriction levels.
a.
Level One: Outdoor water use may occur only on scheduled days within the hours of 12:00 midnight to 10:00 a.m. The scheduled days for odd numbered addresses are Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. The scheduled days for even numbered addresses and golf course fairways are Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. The following uses are prohibited:
1.
Using hydrants for any purpose other than fire fighting, public health, safety or flushing.
2.
Washing hard surfaces such as streets, gutters, sidewalks and driveways, except when necessary for public health and safety.
b.
Level Two: No outdoor water use is allowed other than for retail garden centers, producers of food and fiber and commercial car washes.
Violations of drought restriction levels shall be punished as provided in section 30-212.

(c)
When used during water shortages. The city shall adopt the priority use system as outlined in II-A for use during periods of water shortages. Water shortages may be declared for reasons other than lack of supply.
(d)
Restrictions and enforcement. During periods of drought (when the reservoir pool elevation in 695.6 or less) or other emergency water reduction restrictions on water use shall apply to the following priority uses:
(1)
Industrial uses in which water is required for production of products shall be reduced by 50 percent of the average daily amount as computed by the past 12 months of usage.
(2)
Commercial uses shall be restricted to cooking and sanitary needs only. Commercial car washes will be prohibited while priority use system is in effect.
(3)
Noncommercial uses such as outdoor watering shall be prohibited.
(4)
Outdoor water recreation activities shall be prohibited.
Enforcement procedures shall call for all city employees to report any observed, reported or suspected infraction to the city manager. The first violation shall be a verbal warning to cease restricted water use. Additional violations shall be accessed as follows:
Second violation—$100.00 surcharge;
Third violation—$200.00 surcharge;
Subsequent violations—$200.00 surcharge and lock meter box plus a $300.00 reconnection fee.

f.
Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer.
After the effective date of this article, it shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities.
Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to subsection 30-235(b).
(Ord. No. 2004-028A, § 4, 12-13-04)
Sec. 30-235. - Land development requirements.
(a)
Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank.
(2)

(3)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
(b)
Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this article, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the chief building official finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the planning commission of the city may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
(2)
Except as provided above, the planning commission of the city shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the planning commission. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
b.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the article would create an extreme hardship.
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
(3)
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
a.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
b.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
c.

The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
e.
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
f.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
g.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and,
h.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
(4)
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
a.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
b.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
c.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and,
d.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
e.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance;
f.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.
