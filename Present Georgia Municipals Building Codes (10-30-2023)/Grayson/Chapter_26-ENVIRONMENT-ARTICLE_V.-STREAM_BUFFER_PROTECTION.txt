ARTICLE V. - STREAM BUFFER PROTECTION

Sec. 26-121. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Buffer means the area of land immediately adjacent to the banks of a stream in its existing or enhanced state of vegetation.
Department means the city.
Director means the mayor of the city or designee.
Impervious cover or impervious surface means any paved, hardened or structural surface, including, but not limited to, buildings, dams, decks, driveways, parking areas, patios, streets, swimming pools, tennis courts, walkways, and other structures.
Floodplain means those lands subject to flooding, which would have at least a one percent probability of flooding occurrence in any calendar year based on the basin being fully developed as shown on the current land use plan; i.e., the regulatory flood.
Land development means:
(1)
All activities associated with the conversion of land or the expansion or replacement of an existing use to any new use intended for human operation, occupancy or habitation, other than for agricultural purposes devoted strictly to the cultivation of the land, dairying or animal husbandry. Such activities include land disturbance (clearing and grubbing the land of vegetation and stumps, and grading) and the construction of improvements such as, but not limited to, streets, driveways or parking areas, water or sewer mains, stormwater drainage facilities, sidewalks or other structures permanently placed on or in the property.
(2)
Where appropriate to the context, the term "development" also may be used to denote a specific subdivision or project which is a single entity or intended to be constructed as in interrelated whole, whether simultaneously or in phases.
Land development activity means those actions or activities which comprise, facilitate or result in land development.
Land disturbance means any activity which may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediments into state waters or onto lands within the state, including, but not limited to, clearing, clearing and grubbing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting, and filling of land, but not including agricultural practices.
Land disturbance activity means those actions or activities which comprise, facilitate or result in land disturbance.
Lot or parcel means a designated parcel, tract, or area of land established by plat, subdivision, or as otherwise permitted by law, to be separately owned, used, developed, or built upon.
Perennial stream means a watercourse having a source, terminus, banks and channel through which water flows on a continuous basis as depicted on the most recent United States Geological Survey 7.5-minute quadrangle map (scale 1:24,000).
Permit means the permit issued by the city required for undertaking land development activity.
Protection area or stream protection area means, with respect to a stream, the combined areas of all required buffers and setbacks applicable to such stream.
Riparian means belonging or related to the bank of a river, stream, lake, pond or impoundment.
Setback means, with respect to a stream, the area established by section 26-123(a)(2) extending beyond any buffer applicable to the stream.
Stream means any stream, beginning at:
(1)
The location where the normal stream flow has wrested the vegetation. The normal stream flow is any flow that consists solely of base flow or consists of both base flow and direct runoff during any period of the year. Base flow results from the groundwater that enters the stream channel through the soil. This includes spring flows into streams. Direct runoff is the water entering stream channels promptly after rainfall or snowmelts; or
(2)
A point in the stream channel with a drainage area of 20 acres or more.
Where evidence indicates the presence of a stream in a drainage area of other than 20 acres, the department may require field studies to verify the existence of a stream.
Stream bank means the confining cut of a stream channel.
Stream channel means the portion of a watercourse that contains the base flow of the stream.
Trail, multiuse means a hard surface (concrete, asphalt, boardwalk, etc.) transportation structure specifically constructed for alternative transportation such as walking, biking, roller blading, etc., and not intended to transport motorized vehicles such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, etc.
Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by the county.
Watercourse means any natural or artificial waterway, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently, having a definite channel, bed and bank, and included any area adjacent thereto which is subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater.
Watershed means the land area that drains into a particular stream.

Sec. 26-122. - Applicability.
This article shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area as defined in section 26-121. These requirements are in addition to and do not replace or supersede any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law, and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations. After the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, this article shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities.
(1)
Grandfather provisions. This article shall not apply to the following activities:
a.
Work consisting of the repair, maintenance or replacement within the same disturbed area of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived.
b.
Existing development and ongoing land disturbance activities, including, but not limited to, existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements.
c.
Any lawful land development activity that is under construction, has a valid permit, or has submitted a valid and complete application for a permit as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived provided that the permit is or can be issued within 90 calendar days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived and all timeframes associated with said permit are observed.
d.
Any lawful land development activity that has not been submitted for approval but that is part of a larger master development plan, such as a house in a subdivision or a building in an office park or other phased development that has a valid preliminary plat permit per subsection (1)c of this section, or approved concept plan, or has submitted a valid and complete application for approval of a concept plan and receives approval within 90 calendar days as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, provided that the future permit is or can be issued within two calendar years of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived and all timeframes associated with said permit are observed.
(2)
Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from this article; however, any activity within a state waters' buffer must meet state requirements:
a.
Activities for the purpose of building one of the following:
1.
A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route, including, but not limited to, bike paths and pedestrian trails, or utility line;
2.
Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures;
3.
Land development necessary to provide access to a property;
4.
Public access facilities that must be on the water, including boat ramps, docks, foot trails leading directly to the river, fishing platforms and overlooks;
5.
Unpaved foot trails and paths;
6.
Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality, and/or aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used.
b.
Public sewer line installation in easements running parallel with the stream, where necessary, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance within a state waters' buffer must meet state requirements. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including, but not limited to, manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in subsection (2)a of this section.
c.
Land development activities within a dedicated transportation right-of-way existing at the time this article takes effect or approved under the terms of this article.
d.
Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this article takes effect or approved under the terms of this article, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including, but not limited to, manholes, vents and valve structures.
e.
Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this subsection, the person performing it shall report such work to the city on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten business days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the city to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area.
f.
Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural, or agricultural uses and that are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer.
g.
Multiuse trails no more than 12 feet in width and activities related to construction of a multiuse trail no more than 12 feet in width, provided the trail complies with the requirements of the article III of this chapter.
h.
Detention/water quality ponds, provided said ponds comply with all other local, state and federal requirements including but not limited to articles III and VI of this chapter and the U.S Army Corps of Engineers wetlands regulations.
Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property.
(Ord. of 11-21-2005(4), art. III)
Sec. 26-123. - Land development requirements.
(a)
Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
An undisturbed buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. The land forming the bank is also considered part of the buffer for purposes of this article.
(2)
An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
(3)
The location of septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall comply with the county board of health environmental health section regulations.
Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.
(b)
Variance procedures. Variance requests from the requirements of this article shall be submitted on an application form as prescribed by the director or the director's designee, along with such fees as shall be established by the city council. The director or the director's designee shall coordinate the review of each variance request with all other affected city departments and shall summarize such comments or recommendations as may be received by the zoning board of appeals for action in its normal course of business. The review must include a recommendation from the department. This subsection describes how to apply for a variance from this article; however, any activity within a state waters' buffer must meet state requirements. Variances may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and it is not specifically exempted from this article, its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the department determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the zoning board of appeals may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
(2)
Except as provided above, the zoning board of appeals shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the zoning board of appeals. The department shall follow the public hearing, or "notice," requirements for a variance to be heard by the zoning board of appeals as provided in the city zoning ordinance. Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
The applicant provides evidence that impacts to the buffer have been avoided or minimized to the fullest extent practicable;
b.
The project involves the construction or repair of a structure which, by its nature, must be located within the buffer. Such structures include dams and detention/retention ponds;
c.
Paved recreational foot trails and viewing areas, providing that impacts to the buffer are minimal;
d.
The proposed land disturbing activity within the buffer will receive a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendment of 1972, 33 USC 1344, and the Corps of Engineers has received a mitigation plan to be implemented as a condition of such a permit. In addition, land disturbing activities in the buffer that are outside the USACE's jurisdiction must be mitigated;
e.
The buffer intrusion is mitigated using the procedure established in the county stormwater design manual;
f.
A valid and complete application for rezoning of the property is submitted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived and approval of the rezoning by the city council occurs after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and the variance request is consistent with the intent of this article, factoring into account the property owner's reliance on standards in effect at the time of the rezoning; or
g.
The property is part of a larger master development that has a concept plan previously approved by the city council through the rezoning process, but does not meet the requirements of section 26-122(1)d as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and the variance request is consistent with the intent of this article, factoring into account the property owner's reliance on standards in effect at the time of the rezoning.
(3)
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
a.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
b.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
c.
A dated site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d.
Documentation that impacts to the buffer have been avoided or minimized to the fullest extent practicable;
e.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
f.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable;
g.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed;
h.
A description of the project, with details of the buffer disturbance, including estimated length of time for the disturbance and justification for why the disturbance is necessary;
i.
Any other reasonable information related to the project that the department may deem necessary to effectively evaluate the variance request;
j.
A copy of the permit application, supporting documentation, and proposed mitigation plan as submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendment of 1972, 33 USC 1344, if applicable;
k.
A copy of the permit application, supporting documentation, and proposed mitigation plan as submitted to the state environmental protection division for a variance from the state waters' buffer; and
l.
A buffer mitigation plan in accordance with the procedure outlined in the county stormwater design manual.
(4)
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
a.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
b.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries as determined from field inspection;
c.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion;
d.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
e.
The longterm and construction water quality impacts of the proposed variance;
f.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment; and
g.
The value of mitigation activities as calculated in accordance with the county stormwater design manual.
