ARTICLE II. - ETHICS FOR CITY OFFICIALS

Sec. 2-31. - Purpose.
Declaration of policy. It is the policy of the city that the proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics ordinance for all city officials is adopted.
This Code has the following purposes: (1) to encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials; (2) to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the city; (3) to require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in manners which affect the city; and (4) to serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms.
