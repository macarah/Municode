ARTICLE XV. - PROCEDURES FOR SUBDIVISION PLAT APPROVAL

Sec. 150. - Platting authority.
The Planning Commission shall be the official platting authority.
Sec. 151. - Pre-application review.
Whenever the subdivision of a tract of land within the jurisdiction of the Commission is proposed, the prospective developer should consult early and informally with the Director of Community Planning and Development for advice and assistance. The prospective developer may submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity, and the proposed layout and development of the subdivision. The Director of Community Planning and Development shall return within fifteen (15) days the submitted sketch to the prospective developer and shall inform the prospective developer where the plans do not comply with the regulations set forth in the Ordinance. No fee shall be charged for the pre-application review and no formal application shall be required.
Sec. 152. - Procedure for preliminary plat approval.
Prior to the cutting or grading of any street or the making of any street improvements or the installation of utilities, the prospective developer shall submit to the Planning Commission a Preliminary Plat of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the following:
152.1. Application for Preliminary Plat. Following the pre-application review of a proposed subdivision, the prospective developer shall submit to the Director of Community Planning and Development, at least twenty-six (26) days prior to the next regular meeting of the Commission, a letter requesting review and approval of a preliminary plat and other documents, as specified in Section 153 herein.
152.1.1. Preliminary Plat Filing Fees. Preliminary Plats, when submitted to the Planning Commission in accordance with Section 152.1., shall be accompanied by a fee as determined from the following schedule:
PRELIMINARY PLAT:
1-10 Lots (per lot) .....$25.00
11-30 Lot .....$260.00
plus $10.00 for each lot over 11
31 or more lots .....$454.00
plus $4.00 for each lot over 31
152.2. Review of Preliminary Plat. The Director of Community Planning and Development shall check the plat for conformance to the rules and regulations of this Ordinance and report his findings and recommendations to the Planning Commission, which shall afford a hearing on the preliminary plat.
152.2.1. Preliminary Approval. Following the hearing of the Preliminary Plat and other related material the Commission may express preliminary approval noting the conditions of such approval on three copies of the Preliminary Plat with one copy being returned to the prospective developer, one copy to the office of the Building Inspector for the Council and one copy to be added to the records of the Commission. Approval of a Preliminary Plat does not constitute approval of a Final Plat; it indicates only approval of the layout as a guide to the preparation of the Final Plat. It is the subdivider's decision if or not to submit the three copies of the Preliminary Plat. Because the plat is being submitted in digital format the GIS Department within the City of Kingsland can furnish these copies, provided the digital data is correct and available.
152.2.2. Expiration Time. Preliminary approval shall expire and be of no further effect twelve (12) months from the date of the preliminary approval unless final plat approval has been given on at least one lot of the development.
152.2.3. Disapproval. Following the hearing of the Preliminary Plat and other related material, the Commission may find reasons detrimental to the public safety, health, and general welfare, or in conflict with adopted plans of the Commission which required the disapproval of the Preliminary Plat. A statement of the reasons for disapproval shall be made on two copies of the Preliminary Plat with one copy being added to the records of the Commission. The applicant may reapply for Preliminary Plat approval in accordance with Section 152.1. herein.
152.2.4. Automatic Approval. Failure of the Commission to act on the Preliminary Plat within thirty (30) days after submission thereof, without due cause, shall be deemed to be approval of the Plat and a Certificate of Preliminary Approval shall be issued by the Commission on demand, provided, however, that the prospective developer may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of time.
(Amend. of 7-23-2007)
Sec. 153. - Preliminary plat specification.
153.1. Scale. The Preliminary Plat shall be clearly and legibly drawn at a scale not smaller than 200 feet to one inch.
153.2. Sheet Size. Sheet size shall not be smaller than 18 inches by 24 inches or larger than 24 inches by 36 inches. If the complete plat cannot be shown on a sheet of this size, it may be shown on more than one sheet with an index map on a separate sheet of a reduced scale. All plats shall be submitted in digital format in accordance with the "CAD Layering Specifications for Land Plats Submitted within the City of Kingsland, Georgia",
153.3 CAD LAYERING SPECIFICATIONS - Digital Drawing Specifications for Subdivision Plats Submitted within the City of Kingsland - Camden County, Georgia
153.3.1 Overview. The City of Kingsland GIS Department has prepared a set of CAD standards for the digital submittal of subdivision plat drawings within the city. The GIS Department will work with developers within the city and the county to institute these standards. The purpose of defining these standards is to allow the city when applicable to import the plat data directly into their geographic information system (GIS). Adherence to the standards will allow for quicker plat approval and a quicker update of the county's cadastral data files, saving tax dollars while improving service.
In general, a GIS is a geographic database whose graphic elements are directly tied to non-graphic tabular database records. The graphics and databases are so intrinsically tied that changing the graphics alters the database records, while altering the database may alter the graphic display. There are significant differences between the county's GIS and data stored in a CAD-generated drawing file. Certain data standards must be met to ensure that data prepared with a standard CAD package such as AutoCAD can be quickly and easily converted into the county's GIS data format.
Following is the 'reserved layer' list that specifies the type of data to be drawn on each of the reserved layers: name, line type, color, width, font and text size specifications for any layers to be used in the description and filing of a subdivision plat within the City of Kingsland, GA. In addition to the layering specifications, some general specifications apply, as shown below.
153.3.2 General Specifications
a) All plats submitted within Kingsland will use State Plane Coordinates or UTM (NAD 83). This is the preferred projection; however, it is optional at this time.
b) All submitted drawings will be submitted in both DWG and DXF formats.
c) All submitted DXF files will provide attribute data as an insertion block on layer 9.
d) No other data will be drawn on the reserved layer except those specified.
e) Unspecified data may be added to the drawing file placed on a layer not specified for other use.
f) No symbology, block, or text may be drawn on a reserved layer except those line, block, and text elements specified below.
g) Closure is critical for converting the CAD data into a GIS format.
h) All text elements will be inserted as 'center' unless otherwise specified. In addition, each text element should be located near the center of the feature that it represents; for example, lot number should be located near the center of the lot.
i) Any bearing/distance table generated should be labeled with the Layer number and it's description. For example: Layer 10-Subdivision Distance Table
153.3.3 Methods to submit the digital data
a) Data can be submitted on a 3.5 Floppy disk if it can fit. This file can be compressed as a WinZip file with a .zip extension.
b) Data can be submitted on an Iomega 100MB Zip Disk.
c) Data can be submitted on a CD-ROM
d) Or data can be submitted electronically via email. Prior to sending this file via email though, verbal contact must be made with Ken Kessler, GIS Manager at (912)729-8279. The email address will be kkessler@kingslandgeorgia.com.
153.3.4 Layer Descriptions
1 Subdivision Boundary (Line or Pline)
Line Type: Continuous
Width: 0.0
Color: 5 (Blue)
This line forms the legal limits or the outer boundary of the entire subdivision plat. It forms a closed polygon. This layer may be composed of many lines, but it should result in one and only one closed polygon for each subdivision.
1 Subdivision Name (Text String)
Font: Unspecified
Color: 5 (Blue)
Text Height: Unspecified
This is a text string with an insertion point located any where within the outer boundary of the subdivision (or line work on layer 1).
Brentwood estates
2 Block Boundary (Line or Pline)
Line Type: Continuous
Width: 0.0
Color: 7 (White)
This line or set of lines creates the outer boundary of each block within a subdivision. Block boundaries are generally formed by a combination of right-of-way lines and the subdivision boundary. A block boundary may be further subdivided into many lots or it may not be further subdivided at all, as in the case of a common area such as a large street island or small park. It is also likely that the block boundary lines will be a set of lines that are duplicated on other drawing layers. These will usually be composed of right-of-way lines that bound a block. In this instance, this type of block boundary line will only be drawn if block numbering will be used as a part of the subdivision-block-lot legal description. (That is, the lots are described as lot 17 of block 2). If block numbering will not be used within the subdivision (and there are no common areas that will require a block designation), this layer is to be left blank.
2 Block Number (Text String)
Font: Unspecified
Color: 7 (White)
Text Height: Unspecified
The block number should appear once for every block boundary polygon. If there are no blocks within the subdivision, this layer should be left blank.

Date         Director of Community Planning and Development
153.7. Initiation of Installing Physical Improvements. After receiving a Certificate of Preliminary Approval by the Commission, the subdivider may then proceed to grade the streets and install all improvements prior to submission of the Final Plat, provided the subdivider posts a performance bond with the Treasurer of the Council in an amount and with surety conditions satisfactory to it, providing for and assuring to the Council the actual construction and installation of such improvements within the period of time specified by the Commission and stated in the bond.
153.8. Guarantee of Improvements/Bonds.
153.8.1. Performance Bond.
1. The Planning Commission in its discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to the signing of the final subdivision plat and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond at the time of application for final subdivision approval in an amount estimated by the Planning Commission and City Council as sufficient to secure to the local government the satisfactory construction, installation, and dedication of the uncompleted portion of required improvements. The performance bond shall also secure all lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as required in these regulations.
2. Such performance shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in these regulations. The period within which required improvements must be completed shall be specified by the Kingsland City Council in the resolution approving the final subdivision plat and shall be incorporated in the bond which shall not, in any event, exceed two (2) years from date of final approval.
3. Such bond shall be approved by the Kingsland City Council as to amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the Kingsland City Council. The Planning Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the Kingsland City Council extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one (1) additional year. The Kingsland City Council may at any time during the period of such bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond upon recommendation of the Planning Commission.
153.8.2. Temporary Improvements. The Applicant shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required by Kingsland City Council. Prior to construction of any temporary facilities, a Performance Bond will be required, which bond shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained, and removed.
153.8.3. Costs of Improvements. All required improvements shall be made by the applicant, at his expense, without reimbursement by the City or any improvement district therein.
153.8.4. Governmental Units. Governmental units to which these bonds and contract provisions apply may file in lieu of said contractor bond a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies authorized to act on their behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this Ordinance.
153.8.5. Failure to Complete Improvement. In those cases where a performance bond has been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms of such performance bond, the local government may thereupon declare the bond to be in default and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.
153.8.6. Acceptance of Dedication Offers. Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of streets, public areas, easements, and parks shall be by resolution of the City Council accompanied by the appropriate deed or written easement. The approval by the Planning Commission of a subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the local government of any street, easement, or park shown on said plat. The Planning Commission may require said plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect.
153.8.7. Alternate Improvement Guarantees. If the Kingsland City Council finds that a developer is not able to post a performance bond, the City Council may require the prospective developer to use one of the following improvements guarantee techniques:
1) Escrow Account The prospective developer shall deposit cash, or collateral readily convertible to cash at face value, either with the City Council or in escrow with a bank. The use of collateral other than cash, and the selection of the bank with which funds are to be deposited, are subject to the approval of the City Council.
Where an escrow account is to be employed, the prospective developer shall file with the City Council his agreement with the bank guaranteeing the following:
(a) That the funds in the escrow account are to be held in trust until released by the City Council and may not be used or pledged by the prospective developer as security for any obligation during that period.
(c) That in case the prospective developer fails to complete the required improvements, the bank shall immediately make the funds in escrow available to the City for the completion of these improvements.
153.8.8. Property Escrow. The prospective developer may offer as a guarantee land or other property, including corporate stocks or bonds. A qualified real estate appraiser shall establish the value of any real property so used and in so doing, shall take into account the possibility of a decline or rise in the value of the property during the guarantee period. If requested by the prospective developer, the City Council may exchange the property for an amount of money sufficient to complete the required improvements. When property is offered as an improvement guarantee, the prospective developer shall:
1. Execute an agreement with the escrow agent when it is not the City instructing the agent to release the property to the City in the case of default. The agreement shall be placed on file with the Clerk of the Superior Court.
2. File with the City Council an affidavit affirming that the property to be used as a guarantee is free and clear of any encumbrances or liens at the time it is to be put in escrow.
3. Execute and file with the City Council an agreement stating that the property to be placed in escrow as an improvement guarantee will not be used for any other purpose, or pledged as a security in any other matter, until it is released by the City Council.
153.8.9. Sequential Development. Where a subdivision is to be developed in phased portions, the City Council may waive the use of a guarantee on the initial portion, provided that such portion may not contain more than twenty-five (25) lots, or fifty percent (50%) of the total number of lots proposed for the subdivision, whichever is less. The City Council may grant final plat approval to only one portion at a time, with the plat approval to only one succeeding portion being contingent upon completion of all contracted improvements in each preceding portion, and acceptance of those improvements by the City Council. Completion of improvements in the final portion of the subdivision, which must include at least 25 lots or 50 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision, whichever is less, must be guaranteed through the use of one or the other methods detailed herein.
153.8.10. Letter of Credit. Subject to the approval of the City Council, the subdivider shall provide a letter of credit from a bank or other reputable institution or individual. This letter shall be deposited with the City Council and shall certify the following:
1. That the creditor guarantees funds in an amount equal to the cost, as estimated by the prospective developer and approved by the City Council, of completing all required improvements.
2. That if the prospective developer fails to complete the specified improvements within the required period, the creditor will pay to the City immediately, and without further action, such funds as are necessary to finance the completion of those improvements, up to the limit of credit stated in the letter.
153.8.11. Other Methods. Any other method of sufficient financial commitment that may be acceptable to the City Council.
