This article shall be known and may be cited as the Kingsland Alarm Control Ordinance.
(Ord. of 11-23-92, § 1)
Sec. 15-202. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Alarm contractor means any person or vendor who installs, maintains, repairs, alters, monitors or services alarm systems for compensation. An alarm contractor shall possess a current and appropriate occupational license from the city and county, an alarm contractor's registration certificate issued by the police department and, where applicable, shall meet the requirements for an alarm system contractor pursuant to state statutes. Alarm contractors shall maintain a 24-hour emergency telephone number and shall be capable of responding to an emergency service call within four hours.
Alarm protocol means a confidential systematic program, as determined by the police department, to verify or otherwise confirm the validity of an alarm signal at a banking or other financial institution or any other business or service facility where deemed appropriate by the chief of police or his designated representative.
Alarm signal means the audible sound or a transmission of a signal or a message as the result of the activation of an alarm system or an audible alarm.
Alarm system means any mechanical, electrical or radio-controlled device which is designed to be used for the detection of smoke or fire or of any unauthorized entry into a building, structure or facility, or for alerting others of the possible commission of an unlawful act within a building, structure or facility, or both, which emits a sound or transmits a signal and/or message when activated. Alarm systems include direct dial telephone devices, audible, silent, fire and panic alarms and proprietor alarms. Excluded from the definition of alarm systems are devices which are not designed or used to register alarms that are audible, visible or perceptible outside of the protected building, structure or facility; or auxiliary devices installed by municipal utilities or telephone companies to protect utility systems from damage or disruption of services; or audible alarms that are affixed to motor vehicles. If an alarm system is designed to activate an audible alarm, the alarm system shall be designed so as to automatically deactivate the audible alarm after no more than 30 minutes of operation.
Audible alarm means a device designed for the detection of fire or smoke or of unauthorized entry on premises which generates an audible sound when it is activated.
Commercial premises means any structure or area which is not defined herein as a residential premises.
False alarm means an alarm signal which is responded to by the police department, the fire department or emergency medical services of the city or county, and which is caused by other than an emergency situation, or which is not caused by the activation of either an alarm system or audible alarm as the result of fire or smoke, a burglary, robbery, assault, forced entry or attempted forced entry into the premises protected by such alarm. An alarm will be deemed to be a false alarm when there is no substantial physical evidence which would clearly indicate that smoke, fire or a criminal act was the sole reason for activation of the alarm signal or when the alarm system was intentionally activated by an individual under circumstances where there was no articulable and reasonable basis to believe that a fire, crime or other emergency, warranting immediate response by the appropriate authorities, had occurred or was occurring, or was about to occur. The failure to abide by the established, current, alarm protocol by those responsible on the premises will be considered a separate false alarm under this definition.
Notice means written notice, given either by mail or by personal service upon the addressee.
Residential premises means any structure or combination of structures which serve as dwelling units, including single-family as well as multifamily units.
(Ord. of 11-23-92, § 2)

(b)
If any such person or representative shall fail to appear to turn off an alarm within 30 minutes after being notified by the police department to do so, then the alarm contractor and owner or manager of the premises shall be in violation of this article and shall be punishable as provided by this article.
(c)
All alarm systems shall have a 30-minute cutoff switch installed. Failure to install a cutoff switch constitutes a false alarm and, furthermore, a violation of this article and may result in decal revocation or criminal charges.
(Ord. of 11-23-92, § 3)
Sec. 15-204. - Required reports of false alarms; corrective actions; penalties.
(a)
Responsibility for all false alarms under this article shall be borne by the person or persons occupying or controlling the premises. For each response by the police department to any false alarm, the person owning or maintaining such alarm system shall submit such reports as are set forth in this article or be in violation of this article as follows:
(1)
For any six responses recorded by the police department during any 12-month period to a premises where a false alarm has occurred, no violation of this article shall be deemed to exist; however, the person having or maintaining the burglary or robbery alarm or the alarm protocol shall, within ten working days after notice to do so, make a written report to the chief of police setting forth in writing the cause of such false alarm, the corrective action taken, whether the alarm system has been inspected by an authorized service person, and such other information as the chief of police may reasonably require to determine the cause of such false alarm and corrective action necessary.
(2)
Each and every false alarm over six and up through 12 which requires a response to a premises, during any 12-month period, where there have already occurred six responses during the same period, shall be deemed to constitute a violation of this article and the violator shall be punished by a minimum fine of $50.00.
(3)
False alarm violation number 13 within a 12-month period shall be deemed to constitute a violation of this article and shall be punishable by a minimum fine of $100.00, plus the immediate revocation of the decal issued for the alarm system. In order for the alarm system to be reregistered and reactivated, the alarm system shall be serviced by an alarm contractor or the person who is in charge of the alarm system, inspected and certified to the satisfaction of a designated representative of the chief of police, and the decal reissued at a reissuance fee of $50.00.
(b)
Use of a nonregistered alarm system by any person is unlawful and shall constitute a violation of this article and shall be punishable by a minimum fine of $100.00.
(c)
Within 15 working days after a false alarm violation has been committed, the police department shall notify the decal holder of the alarm system from which such false alarm emanated that the false alarm violation has occurred and the steps necessary to answer the charge. Any person who fails to appear to answer such charge, or to pay a fine levied by the municipal court concerning such charge, is subject to having the decal revoked for the alarm system.
(d)
Failure of the police department to mail or serve the notice provided for in this article shall preclude the assessment of a false alarm violation; however, such violation shall still be considered as a violation for the purposes of calculating the number of false alarm violations necessary to warrant revocation of the alarm system decal.
