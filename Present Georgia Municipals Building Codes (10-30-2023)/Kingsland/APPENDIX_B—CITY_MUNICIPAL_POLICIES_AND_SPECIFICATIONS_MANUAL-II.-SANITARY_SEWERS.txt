The pumps shall be tested at the place of manufacture in accordance with the standards of the Hydraulic Institute for testing of pumps. Each pump shall be tested with the actual drive unit to be furnished on the job. The test reports shall cover the complete range of the pumps and shall contain the information necessary to demonstrate that the units are in conformance with these Specifications. The following shall be recorded for each pump tested.
a.
TDH vs. capacity.
b.
Pump efficiency vs. capacity.
c.
Horsepower vs. capacity.
d.
Speed of rotation.
2.
Six copies of all certified test reports shall be submitted to the City.
C.
Installation: The pumps, drives and accessories shall be installed, tested and adjusted and the installation certified in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements.
D.
Field Testing
1.
Following installation and checkout, the ability of the pumps to operate under actual field conditions without overheating, leakage or excessive wear, vibration, or noise shall be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City.
2.
Before placing installation into service, the pumps shall be run continuously with the motor not submerged for 30 minutes under full load current with no damage resulting to the pump motor. The pumps shall, during this test, produce the designed GPM and TDH condition and experience a heat rise of no more than 45 degrees C above ambient temperature.
3.
In the event any of the pumping equipment fails to meet the above test requirements, it shall be modified and retested in accordance with the requirements of this Manual.
4.
Each pump's performance shall be documented by obtaining concurrent readings showing motor voltage and amperage, pump suction head and pump discharge head. Such readings shall be documented for at least three pumping conditions. One test shall be at shut-off head. Each power lead to the motor shall be checked for proper current balance.
5.
The Contractor shall submit two certified copies of all test results to the City prior to acceptance of the installation.
E.
Pump Warranty
The pump manufacturer shall warrant the units supplied against defects in workmanship and materials for a period of five years or 10,000 hours. Warranty shall apply to parts and labor prorated over 60 months. For the first 18 months, 100% parts and labor apply. The warranty shall be in printed form.
