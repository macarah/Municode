Pipe shall be laid true to line and grades indicated and shall rest upon the pipe bed for the full length of each section. Runs of pipe shall be laid with outside bells or grooved ends upgrade beginning at the lower end of the pipeline. Pipe having its grade and/or joint disturbed after laying shall be removed, cleaned and relaid.
C.
When pipes are protected by headwalls or connect with drainage structures, the exposed ends of the pipe shall be placed or cut flush with the inside face of the structure. After the pipe is cut the rough edges shall be smoothed up in an approved manner. All pipes shall be laid so that markings are on top and the inner surfaces abut neatly, tightly and smoothly.
D.
All pipes in place shall be inspected by a City of Kingsland representative before being covered and concealed. Contractor shall clear all pipe of silt debris prior to final acceptance.
3.2 - CORRUGATED METAL PIPE JOINTS
Corrugated metal pipe shall be butted to form a smooth joint; the space between the pipe and coupling bands shall be kept free from dirt and grit so that the corrugations fit snugly. The coupling band, while being tightened, shall be tapped with a softhead mallet of wood, rubber, or plastic to take up slack and insure a tight joint. Coupling band bolts and damaged areas of coupling bands and pipe shall be given a coating of asphalt cement. Pipe on which the asphalt coating has been damaged to such extent that satisfactory field repairs cannot be made will be replaced.
3.3 - CONCRETE PIPE JOINT
A.
Joint installation shall be in accordance with the manufacturer of the joint material. Surface to receive lubricants, cements, or adhesives shall be clean and dry. Gaskets and jointing materials shall be affixed to the pipe not more than 24 hours prior to the installation of the pipe, and shall be protected from the sun, blowing dust, and other deletions agents at all times. Gaskets and jointing materials shall be inspected before installation of the pipe, and any loose or improperly affixed gaskets and jointing materials shall be removed and replaced.
B.
The pipe shall be aligned with the previously installed pipe, and the joint pulled together. If, while making the joint, the gasket or jointing material becomes loose and can be seen through the exterior joint recess when the joint is pulled up to within one inch of closure, the pipe shall be removed and the joint remade.
3.4 - CORRUGATED POLYETHYLENE PIPE JOINTS
A.
Couplings shall not reduce or impair the overall integrity or function of the pipeline.

C.
Couplings shall provide sufficient longitudinal strength to preserve pipe alignment and prevent separation at the joints. Couplings shall be bell and spigot or split couplings. Split couplings shall engage at least two full corrugations on each pipe section. Stainless steel bolts and nuts shall fasten split couplings.
