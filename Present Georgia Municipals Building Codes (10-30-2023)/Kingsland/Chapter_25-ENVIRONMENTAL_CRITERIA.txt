Chapter 25 - ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 25-1—25-25. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS PROTECTION

Sec. 25-25. - Title and purpose.
(a)
Title. This chapter will be known as the "City of Kingsland, Georgia Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance."
(b)
Purpose. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate with the City of Kingsland, Georgia and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the City of Kingsland, Georgia and surrounding communities rely on as a source of public water.
Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(Ord. No. 2006-01, 1-9-2006)
Sec. 25-26. - Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply to this chapter.
Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
DRASTIC means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. (Note: the "DRASTIC" methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluation of pollution susceptibility.)
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. Recharge areas are determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Hydrologic Atlas 20, Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia, prepared by the Natural Resources.
Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the Department of Natural Resources, using DRASTIC methodology. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land area of the state into areas having high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential.
Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (current edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density or lithologic contacts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces.
(Ord. No. 2006-01, 1-9-2006)
Sec. 25-27. - Establishment of the groundwater recharge area protection district.
(a)
The groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Kingsland, Camden County, Georgia that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and made part of this chapter.
(b)
Determination of pollution susceptibility: each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter.

ARTICLE III. - WETLANDS PROTECTION

Sec. 25-51. - Title and purpose.
(a)
Title. This article will be known as Wetlands Protection ordinance of the City of Kingsland, Georgia.
(b)
Purpose. The wetlands in the City of Kingsland are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. Nationally, a considerable number of these important resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare of our community.
This chapter is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.
(Ord. No. 2006-02, 1-9-2006)
Sec. 25-52. - Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
Generalized wetlands map: means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps for City of Kingsland, Camden County, Georgia.
Jurisdictional wetland: an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination: a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended.
Regulated activity: means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredge or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Wetland: means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophilic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
Wetland protection district: means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the City of Kingsland in Camden County, Georgia, as indicated on the wetlands map; provided however, that the wetlands map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City of Kingsland, Camden County, Georgia and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. No. 2006-02, 1-9-2006)
Sec. 25-53. - Wetlands protection district.
(a)
The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Kingsland, Camden County, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City of Kingsland, Camden County, Georgia and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended.

Sec. 25-57. - Land disturbing activity and wetland protection.
(a)
When wetlands assessment required. This section is intended to provide applicants for a land disturbing activities permit with notice when the proposed activity may require a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) permit due to impact upon jurisdictional wetlands. The provisions in the following paragraph of this section shall not apply if the applicant can provide to the city a valid USACOE wetland delineation that verifies that the proposed activity is not located within jurisdictional wetlands, or if the applicant can provide a valid USACOE permit or letter that authorizes the proposed activity within the jurisdictional wetlands. If such evidence of compliance with USACOE permitting requirements is provided, the city shall follow normal procedures for issuing a land disturbing permit.
(b)
Wetlands Assessment. Prior to the issuance of a land disturbing activities permit the city shall assess whether the proposed activity could result in a disturbance of wetlands and, if so, shall also assess whether the proposed activity is located inside or within 50 feet of a wetland protection district.
(1)
If the city determines that the proposed activity could not result in a disturbance of wetlands or if the proposed activity is not located inside or within 50 feet of a wetland protection district, the city shall follow normal procedures for issuing a land disturbing permit.
(2)
If the city determines that the proposed activity could result in a disturbance of wetlands and that the proposed activity is located inside or within 50 feet of a wetland protection district, a USACOE jurisdictional wetland determination shall be required prior to issuance of a land disturbing activities permit. No land disturbing permit will be issued without a USACOE permit or letter of approval.
