--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Printed herein is the Municipal Fees ordinance, as adopted by the mayor and city council on October 17, 2006. Amendments to the ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. Section 1-104 of Chapter 1- "General Provisions" in the 1998 Code provided that the headings appearing in the Code were "intended as mere captions to indicate the contents" therein, and were not to be deemed or taken as a part of the substantive law of the Code. Thus, for stylistic purposes, headings, catchlines, and section numbers that had appeared in the municipal fees chapter have been made uniform and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. Additions made for purposes of clarity are indicated by brackets.
