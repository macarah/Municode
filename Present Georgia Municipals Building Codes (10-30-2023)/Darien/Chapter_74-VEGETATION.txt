Editor's note— The sections that comprise this article were originally enacted under an ordinance entitled "Tree and Landscape Ordinance," adopted by the mayor and city council on June 18, 2002. Attached as appendices to this ordinance were lists characterizing tree sizes by species, labeled appendix A, and a list of Streetscapes and Parks Committee rules and regulations, labeled as appendix B. The list characterizing tree sizes by species appears as appendix D of this Code. The appendix comprising the Streetscapes and Parks Committee rules and regulations was not printed in the Code at the discretion of the editor.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 74-19. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
This article is enacted to provide standards for:
(1)
Preserving and/or replacing trees and vegetation as part of the land development and building construction process;
(2)
Improving the aesthetic appearance of commercial, governmental, industrial and residential areas through the incorporation of landscaping guidelines into development, in ways that enhance the environment;
(3)
Maintaining permeable land areas essential to surface water management and aquifer recharge;
(4)
Encouraging the conservation of natural resources through the use of native plants and maintenance techniques as recommended by the American National Standards Institute (A300);
(5)
Promoting energy conservation through the creation of shade, thereby reducing heat retention in or on buildings or paved areas;
(6)
Protecting canopy and specimen trees as defined in this article.
(b)
The intent of these standards is to provide necessary information to facilitate development project design, plan review, and enforcement processes so that the provisions of the article can be administered by the city staff in the most effective, efficient and economical manner. In furtherance of this intent, the City of Darien, Georgia Tree and Landscape Ordinance Activities Manual (Activities Manual) is created as a tool to provide detailed examples and guidance in creation and implementation of development plans in compliance with this article and is made a part thereof.

Sec. 74-21. - Definitions.
The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Basal caliper means the diameter of a plant's main stem measured at six inches above ground level.
Canopy tree means a large tree that has a distinct presence in the landscape or forest where the limbs overhang large areas including public rights-of-way.
Critical root zone (CRZ) means the minimum area beneath a tree which must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass to give a tree a reasonable chance of survival. The critical root zone (CRZ) will typically be represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree's trunk with a radius equal in feet to one times the number of inches of the trunk diameter. For example, the CRZ radius of a 20-inch diameter tree is 20 feet.
Preserved tree means any tree indicated on a site development plan that is to be protected during development of property for incorporation into the final landscaping requirements.
Sight triangle means the area of property on both sides of a driveway formed by the intersection of each side of the driveway and public right-of-way, with the two sides of each triangle being a minimum of 15 feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a straight line connecting the ends of the two other sides.
Specimen tree means any tree designated for preservation because of rarity, aesthetic value, historical value, botanical importance, importance to overall community planning or size.
Street yard means a perimeter planting area which is located between a street right-of-way and a vehicular use area.
Structural roots means those tree roots which should not be encroached upon by soil disruptions and hard scape installation (see appendix B).
Tree means, for purposes of land clearing, any woody plant, except dogwood or other flowering tree, that has a single trunk with a caliper of five inches or more at six inches above the ground. A dogwood or other flowering tree with a caliper of two inches or more at six inches above the ground is also defined as a tree.
Vehicular use area means any ground surface area, except public rights-of-way, used by any type of vehicle, whether moving or at rest, for purposes including, but not limited to, driving, parking, loading, unloading, storage or display such as, but not limited to, new and used car lots, activities of a drive-in nature in connection with banks, restaurants, filling stations, grocery stores, and convenience stores.

The city seeks to protect the live oak (Quercus virginiana L.) as well as exceptional specimens of other tree species within the city limits. Every effort shall be made to ensure survival of trees designated as specimen trees. In recognition of the importance of these trees and the additional costs likely to be incurred in the conservation of specimen trees, the following requirements and credits are enacted:
(1)
Specimen tree designation. City staff shall annually recommend a list of specimen trees to the city council. Upon action of the city council in regular meeting assembled, the trees accepted as specimen trees shall enjoy protection under this article. The list shall include tree identification by property identification number, diameter and approximate height. The list shall be published as an annual addendum to the Tree and Landscape Ordinance Activities Manual.
(2)
Critical root zone is the minimum conserved area. The minimum area which must be conserved for use by a specimen tree is the critical root zone (CRZ). Conservation outside the boundaries of the CRZ is strongly encouraged.
(3)
Use of CRZ area under special conditions. Some portion of the CRZ of a specimen tree may be allowed (i.e., for vehicle use, storage, or structure overhang) if additional protections and treatments are provided and specific conditions are met.
(4)
Root zone specific conditions. The following minimum criteria must be met and maintained to achieve and maintain specimen tree conservation credits:
a.
Soil compaction. Soil compaction as measured by bulk density is 1.7g/cc or less in sandy soils and 1.3g/cc or less in clay soils during construction and maintained at or below this limit after construction throughout the conserved area.
b.
Water supply. Permanent water supply adequate to deliver one inch of water per week to the entire conserved area.
c.
Organic matter. Provisions are made to supply and cover the entire conserved area with an average minimum depth of two inches of wood-product mulch annually.
d.
Soil pH. Soil pH is maintained between 4.5 and 7.0. over the entire conserved area.
(5)
Credits for specimen tree conservation. The credits for specimen tree conservation are measured in square unit area. Credits are determined by subtracting the 20 percent minimum permeable ground requirement area from the conserved area. The positive remainder in square unit area is the credit for specimen tree conservation.
(6)
Applying for credits for specimen tree conservation. A request for consideration for tree conservation credits shall be submitted with the site development plan. The request shall include description of the methods for achieving root-zone-specific conditions and show calculations for determining the credits requested. The applicant will be notified by the city in writing upon issuance of the building permit if credits will tentatively be awarded for the project.
(7)
Award of credits. Credits will be officially awarded in writing at issuance of certificate of occupancy upon completion of inspection and testing has confirmed all specific conditions have been met.
(8)
Redeeming credits for specimen tree conservation. Credits may be redeemed on subsequent development projects on a one-for-one basis against minimum permeable land requirements.
(9)
Reporting transfer of credits for specimen tree conservation. The owner of specimen tree conservation credits may elect to sell or otherwise permanently transfer some or all of their accumulated credits to another party. The city shall be notified of the transfer with a letter signed by all involved parties stating the quantity of credits transferred, naming the provider and the receiver of credits, and the effective date of the transfer.
(10)
Replacement of specimen trees. In the event that it is not possible to retain a specimen tree on a development site, the specimen tree shall be replaced on a species per species and basal-cross-sectional-inch per basal-cross-sectional-inch basis. (E.g. one 24-inch diameter live oak specimen tree would be replaced by 16 six-inch diameter live oaks, or 36 four-inch caliper live oaks, or 144 two-inch caliper live oaks, or combination thereof.)
(11)
Alternatives to planting specimen tree replacement trees on the development site. Alternatives to planting all replacements for specimen trees on the development site are:
a.
To plant the replacement trees on other lands within the city limits upon approval of the property owner and provided the sites meet all planting site and maintenance requirements under this chapter;
b.
To deposit sufficient monies into the tree fund to cover the cost for the city to plant the replacement trees; or
c.
A combination of these.
