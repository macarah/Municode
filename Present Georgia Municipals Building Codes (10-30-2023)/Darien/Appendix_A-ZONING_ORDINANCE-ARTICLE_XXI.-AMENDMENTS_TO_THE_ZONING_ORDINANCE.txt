After acceptance of application for an amendment, the city council of the City of Darien shall transmit of copy thereof to the planning and zoning commission which shall submit its findings to the city council of the City of Darien within 30 days from the date it received the petition. If the planning and zoning commission fails to submit a report within 30 days, it shall be deemed to have denied the requested change or departure. The planning commission may extend its time to report by up to 60 additional days in 30-day increments by vote of the planning commission if it seeks additional information or in the case of amendment proposals for a planned unit development or other proposal that involves complicated issues of fact or law. The planning and zoning commission shall consider each proposal for amendment and as a basis for its recommendations shall report on the following matters, among others, as appropriate to the circumstances of the case.
1.
Compatibility with comprehensive development plans; timing of development. The planning and zoning commission shall examine the proposal to determine whether it is in accord with comprehensive development plans. In its findings in this regard, it may report that the proposal is compatible or incompatible, or that while the change is in accord with those of longer range it would be premature in the light of the comprehensive development plans. The planning and zoning commission shall not recommend any change not in accord with adopted comprehensive development plans but may, where it sees fit, recommend changes in such plans, following which, if such change in plans are officially adopted, the zoning change may be reconsidered without prejudice and without a new application if an application is involved.
2.
Availability of and effect on public facilities and services; referrals to other agencies. The planning and zoning commission shall consider and report on the availability of public facilities and services and the effect the proposed change would have on demands for public facilities and services in the area in which the change is proposed or generally. Such facilities and services include but are not limited to water supply, sewerage, drainage, transportation, schools, fire and police protection, and solid waste collection and disposal.
3.
Availability of other land suitable for proposed use; effect on balance of land uses. The planning and zoning commission may consider the availability of other appropriate land already zoned for the proposed use, generally and in the area of the proposed change.
The planning and zoning commission may also consider whether generally, or in the area of the proposed change, the change would have adverse environmental effects on the balance of land uses by removing land from a category for which it is suited and for which there is a greater public need to a category for which the public need is lesser.
4.
Effect on character of the neighborhood. The planning and zoning commission shall consider the effect of uses permitted under the proposed change on the surrounding neighborhood and shall report any substantial adverse influences on desirable living conditions or sustained stability, or any tendencies toward blight and depreciation likely to result from the change.
5.
Suitability of proposed uses. The planning and zoning commission shall consider whether the zoning proposal will permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property.
6.
Effect on adjacent property. The planning and zoning commission shall consider whether the zoning proposal will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property.
7.
Economic use of current zoning. The planning and zoning commission shall consider whether the property to be affected by the zoning proposal has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned.
8.
Other conditions. The planning and zoning commission shall consider whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal.
