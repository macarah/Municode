The plan of the event as proposed is likely to substantially restrict and/or congest traffic (vehicular or pedestrian) on any of the public roads, right-of-ways, sidewalks, or waterways in the immediate vicinity of such event;
(9)
The plan of the event as proposed is likely to cause a substantial disturbance of the peace as defined in state law, or is likely to intrude upon the privacy or property of citizens in the area of the proposed event in a manner violative of state law, or is likely to burden commerce in the area of the event by obstructing entrances or exits to any retail, wholesale, manufacturing, transportation, storage, office, or professional or personal service establishment, or by obstructing parking areas, loading docks, driveways, walkways or other methods of ingress or egress to any such establishment;

No flag, sign, display, banner, rope, cable, wire, chain, or structure may be draped or affixed to any city property, including, but not limited to, the streets, sidewalks, trees, buildings or other properties of the city.
(e)
It is the specific intent of the city in enacting this ordinance to regulate only the time, place and manner of events and not to regulate the content or message of any speech or expressive conduct. The factors enumerated above, which we find express and support the substantial and compelling interests of this governing body in the preservation of the rights and liberties of its citizens and the safety, health, and good order of its society, are the only bases upon which the permitting officer shall decide to issue or deny a permit applied for hereunder and no such decision shall be made or justified based upon the anticipated or predicted content of the speech or expressive conduct of any applicant.
