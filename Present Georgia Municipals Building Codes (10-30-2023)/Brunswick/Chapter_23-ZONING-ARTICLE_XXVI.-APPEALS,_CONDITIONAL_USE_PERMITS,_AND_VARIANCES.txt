The extent to which the proposed mix of land uses is appropriate in terms of location and character.
(3)
The extent to which the development is compatible with surrounding properties. Compatibility can be achieved by ensuring that the overall scale and design of development does not overwhelm or otherwise detract from the established character of the neighborhood or surroundings. The PD zoning district is not intended to allow for the intrusion of incompatible land uses into single-family neighborhoods that create negative land use impacts.
(4)
The extent to which the proposed architectural features of buildings within the development are harmonious.
(5)
The adequacy of open spaces, play areas and recreation facilities that are provided for the needs of the development occupants.

Access into and out of the property adequately provides for traffic and pedestrian safety, the anticipated volume of traffic flow, and access by emergency vehicles.
(c)
Public facilities such as schools, water or sewer utilities, and police or fire protection are adequate to serve the conditional use permit.
(d)
Refuse, service, parking and loading areas on the property are located and screened to protect other properties in the area from such adverse effects as noise, light, glare or odor.
(e)
The hours and manner of operation of the conditional use permit have no adverse effects on other adjacent or surrounding properties.

At its discretion, the governing body may refer an application involving a concept plan revised after its consideration by the planning and appeals commission back to the planning and appeals commission for additional study and recommendation.
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018)

Sec. 23-26-19. - Decisions involving constitutional challenges.
In ruling on any rezoning in which the applicant has brought a constitutional challenge to the existing zoning classification, the governing body shall pay particular attention to the following criteria which have been applied by state courts in zoning matters:
(1)
Existing uses and zoning of the subject and nearby property;
(2)
The extent to which property values are diminished by the particular zoning restrictions;
(3)
The extent to which the destruction of property values, if any, promotes the healthy, safety, morals or general welfare of the public;
(4)
The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship, if any, imposed upon the individual property owner;
(5)
The suitability of subject property for zoned purposes;
(6)
The length of time the property, if vacant, has been vacant as zoned considered in the context of land development in the areas and the vicinity of the property.
The existing zoning classification shall be considered presumptively valid and it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to present evidence that rebuts this presumption. If the governing body determines, from the evidence presented, that the existing zoning classification is unduly burdensome to the applicant and is not offset by the considerations of the public's health, safety, morals and general welfare, and considerations of the integrity of this Code and of the official zoning map, the governing body may impose upon said property any appropriate zoning classification, including conditions, which might be consistent with these considerations, the Comprehensive Plan, and the criteria described in this chapter.

DIVISION 4. - TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS

Sec. 23-26-35. - Purpose and intent.
Understanding the demands placed on the community's transportation network by development is an important dimension of assessing the overall impacts of development proposals. All development generates traffic, and it may generate enough traffic to create congestion and thus require the community to invest more capital funds into the transportation network in the form of new roads, traffic signals, and intersection improvements. Traffic congestion results in a number of problems, including economic costs due to delayed travel times, air pollution and accidents. A traffic impact analysis is a mechanism for the city to foresee the demands a development proposal will place on the transportation network.
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018)
Sec. 23-26-36. - Objectives.
The city finds that requiring a traffic impact analysis for proposed developments that meet certain thresholds will help to achieve the following objectives:
(a)
Forecast additional traffic associated with new development, based on accepted practices.
(b)
Determine the improvements that are necessary to accommodate the new development.
(c)
Allow the city to assess the impacts that a proposed development may have and assist the city in making decisions regarding development proposals.
(d)
Help to ensure safe and reasonable traffic conditions on streets after the development is complete.
(e)
Reduce the negative impacts created by developments by helping to ensure that the transportation network can accommodate the development.
(f)
Protect the substantial public investment in the street system.
(g)
Provide information relevant to citywide comprehensive planning, transportation planning, transit planning, and the provision of programs and facilities for traffic safety, road improvements, transportation demand management, pedestrian access, and other transportation system considerations.
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018)
Sec. 23-26-37. - Definitions.
City engineer: The City Engineer of the City of Brunswick, or his or her designee.
Discretionary development proposal: Any application for a rezoning, preliminary plat, conditional use permit, final design plan approval, or certificate of appropriateness. For purposes of this Code, a determination of applicability shall be made at the first discretionary development proposal encountered.
Horizon year: Unless otherwise specified or approved by the city engineer, the horizon year shall be 20 years into the future from the year during which a traffic impact study is being prepared.
Internal trips: Trips that are made within a multi-use or mixed-use development, by vehicle or by an alternate mode such as walking.
Level of service (LOS): A quantitative and qualitative measure of how well traffic flows on a given street or highway. Level of service relates to such factors as highway width, number of lanes, percentage of trucks, total traffic volume, turning movements, lateral clearances, grades, sight distance, capacity in relation to volume, travel speed, and other factors which affect the quality of flow. Level of service is typically summarized by letter grades described as follows:
Level "A" is a condition with low traffic volumes, high speeds, and free-flow conditions.
Level "B" is a condition with light traffic volumes, minor speed restrictions, and stable flow.
Level "C" is a condition with moderate traffic volumes, where speed and maneuvering are restricted to a limited degree by the amount of traffic.
Level "D" is a condition with heavy traffic operating at tolerable speeds, although temporary slowdowns in flow may occur.
Level "E" is a condition of very heavy flow and relatively low speeds. Under Level "E" the traffic is unstable and short stoppage may occur.
Level "F" is a condition of extremely heavy flow, with frequent stoppage and very slow speeds. It is an unstable traffic condition under which traffic often comes to a complete halt.
New trips: Total vehicle trips, minus pass-by trips, minus internal trips if applicable.
PDC director: The director of planning, development and codes for the City of Brunswick, or his or her designee.
Pass-by trips: Vehicle trips which are made by traffic already using the adjacent roadway and entering the site as an intermediate stop on the way to another destination.
Peak hour: 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily.
Peak-hour trip generation study: A study by a qualified professional of one or more actual developments of similar land use and development characteristics which provides empirical data on the actual number of trips entering and exiting said development(s) during the a.m. and p.m. peak hour. A peak-hour trip generation study shall consist of a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic counts by direction (entering and exiting) on at least three separate weekdays if the study is based on only one similar development, or at least one a.m. and p.m. traffic count for three different actual developments. The results of actual traffic counts from peak-hour trip generation studies may be adjusted to discount pass-by trips as provided in this chapter.
Professionally accepted: Published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers; or prepared by a qualified professional under work supervised by the City or Glynn County, or prepared by a qualified professional and accepted by the city engineer.
Qualified professional: For purposes of conducting traffic impact analyses as may be required by this chapter, a qualified professional shall mean a registered professional engineer with experience in traffic engineering. For purposes of conducting peak hour trip generation studies, a qualified professional shall mean a registered professional engineer with experience in traffic engineering, or another professional approved by the city engineer based on education and experience to conduct such trip generation studies.
Traffic impact analysis: A study, conducted by a qualified professional, which assesses the effects that a discretionary development proposal's traffic will have on the transportation network in a community or portion thereof. Traffic impact studies vary in their range of detail and complexity depending on the type, size, and location of the proposed development.
Trip: A single or one-directional travel movement with either the origin or destination of the trip inside the study site.
Trip generation: An estimate of the number of vehicle trips that will be generated due to the new development, which is calculated based on the type and amount of land uses in the proposed development and professionally accepted trip generation rates for each such land use. Trip generation may be expressed on an average daily basis or average peak hour (a.m., p.m.), or both.

Sec. 23-26-38. - Thresholds of applicability.
A traffic impact study shall be required for any discretionary development proposal which can be reasonably expected to generate 1,000 vehicle trip ends during a single day and/or more than 100 vehicle trips during the morning or afternoon peak hours, as determined by professionally acceptable information as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018)
Sec. 23-26-39. - Exemptions.
(a)
A traffic impact analysis is not required if a discretionary development proposal is initiated by the governing body or the planning and appeals commission.
(b)
A discretionary development proposal may be exempted from the traffic impact study requirement by the city engineer if a prior traffic impact study for the subject property has been submitted to the city or is available from Glynn County and the proposed development is substantially similar to that for which the prior traffic impact study was conducted.
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018)
Sec. 23-26-40. - Trip generation data.
The source for trip generation rates for the purposes of this Code shall be "Trip Generation" published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), most recent edition, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer.

(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018)
Sec. 23-26-41. - Determination of applicability.
At the time a discretionary development proposal is filed, or during any pre-application meeting if possible, the PDC Director shall determine whether a traffic impact analysis shall be required according to this chapter. The PDC director shall calculate the expected trip generation of the proposed development using professionally accepted trip generation rates or other data and compare it to the thresholds specified in this chapter to determine whether a traffic impact analysis is required. The city engineer shall assist in this effort by providing the director with any updated information available on trip generation rates.
Applicants for discretionary development proposals shall provide sufficient information about the development proposal (e.g., number of dwelling units, square footage of buildings, number of employees, land area of the development, etc.) for the PDC director to apply professionally accepted trip generation rates to the proposed development. The director shall not accept a discretionary development proposal for processing unless it contains the data on the proposed development necessary to apply available trip generation rates. Further, no application for a discretionary development proposal shall be accepted nor advertised for a public hearing until such time as the transportation impact study, if required, has been completed and submitted in accordance with this chapter.
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018)
Sec. 23-26-42. - Cases where data are not available.
In the event that information submitted by the applicant of the discretionary development proposal is sufficient to calculate the trip generation that would be expected to result from the proposed development, but trip generation rates or other data are not available or in sufficient quantity of studies to make a determination of applicability under the terms of this chapter, this section shall apply.
(a)
The director shall first consult with the city engineer to determine if:
(1)
Professionally acceptable trip generation rates applicable to the subject development exist from other reputable sources, such as the Journal of the Institute of Transportation Engineers;
(2)
Other trip generation studies of similar developments are available; or
(3)
Professionally acceptable trip generation rates for one or more similar land uses can be used in making the determination of applicability.
If the city engineer is able to provide such information and determines it is professionally reputable, then the director shall use said data as may be interpreted by the city engineer to make the determination of applicability. The director and city engineer shall have no more than ten working days to comply with the provisions of this section, when it applies.
(b)
In the event the director is unable to make a determination of applicability after consulting with the city engineer pursuant to this section, the director shall notify the proposed applicant in writing that professionally accepted trip generation rates are not available for purposes of making a determination of applicability.
(c)
Upon receipt of notice described in this section, the applicant for a discretionary development proposal shall have 30 days to have a qualified professional prepare and submit a peak-hour trip generation study as defined by this chapter.
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018)
Sec. 23-26-43. - Specifications for peak-hour trip generation studies.
(a)
Discounting of pass-by trips. The peak-hour trip generation study may subtract from the empirical data on actual vehicle trips those trips that are reasonably considered to be "pass-by" trips as defined by this chapter, using professionally accepted assumptions about the percent of pass-by trips approved by the city engineer.
(b)
Reduction for internal trips in multi-use or mixed use developments. In calculating the new trips generated from a proposed development containing multiple uses or mixed uses, a qualified professional with the approval of the city engineer may apply a percentage reduction to the total vehicle trips shown in any peak hour trip generation study to account for internal trips, as defined in this chapter, so as to account for (discount) the number of internal trips reasonably expected to occur in such multi-use or mixed use development. Said reduction shall not exceed 24 percent of total trips generated.
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018)
Sec. 23-26-44. - Scoping meeting.
Once it is determined that a traffic impact analysis is required, a scoping meeting may be held with the developer or his or her consultant and the appropriate representatives of the city engineering department and if appropriate, the PDC department. It will be the responsibility of the developer or his or her consultant to initiate this meeting. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the availability of site-specific information concerning the development, available forecasts of traffic volumes, and to ensure the applicant understands the content requirements for traffic impact analyses.
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018)

DIVISION 5. - DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL IMPACT

Sec. 23-26-52. - Definitions.
Initial DRI information form: A form intended to identify basic information about a proposed development of regional impact on which a local government is being requested to take action, and which provides information to the regional commission (RC). This form notifies the RC of a potential development of regional impact in order for the RC to meet its responsibilities within the DRI review process.
DRI review initiation request form: A form intended to provide additional information about the proposed project to the regional commission (RC), the submission of which serves as an official request that the DRI review process be started by the RC.
Regional development center: The coastal regional center.
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018)
Sec. 23-26-53. - Applicability.
This chapter shall apply when an applicant (industry, business, or developer) requests some type of local government action related to a project, such as, but not limited to, a request for a zoning change or conditional use, zoning variance, permit, hookup to a water or sewer system, master or site plan approval, or entering into a contract, and it appears that the proposed development (or, for multi-phased projects, the complete development) meets the threshold(s) of a development of regional impact, according to "Rules of Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Chapter 110-12-3, Developments of Regional Impact, Effective July 1, 2001," as may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018)
Sec. 23-26-54. - Jurisdiction.
If a proposed development project is to be located in more than one jurisdiction and, in total, the proposed development meets or exceeds a DRI threshold, the local government in which the largest portion of the project is to be located is responsible for initiating the DRI review process.
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018)
Sec. 23-26-55. - Procedures.
The application procedures established in chapter XX-2 and chapter XX-3 will be modified by this chapter in cases where a rezoning or conditional use permit application, or an annexation application respectively, fits the definition of a "development of regional impact." Developments of regional impact will be processed according to procedures of the State Department of Community Affairs as described in "Rules of Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Chapter 110-12-3, Developments of Regional Impact, effective July 1, 2001," as may be amended from time to time.
When an application is received for development that meets or exceeds the thresholds established for that development type and thus constitutes a "development of regional impact" according to the aforementioned rules of the state department of community affairs, the city will follow the procedures identified in said administrative rules which are summarized here.
When an application for a development of regional impact is received, the PDC director or city engineer, on behalf of the city, will complete an "initial DRI information" form and a "DRI review initiation request" form. Each of these two forms may be submitted to the regional commission simultaneously, provided the city has all necessary project-related information.
The city shall not take any official legislative or administrative action to advance or further a DRI project until the review process identified under the DRI review procedure specified in "Rules of Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Chapter 110-12-3, Developments of Regional Impact, Effective July 1, 2001," as may be amended from time to time, is completed. The city may undertake preliminary staff administrative functions associated with a proposed DRI including, but not limited to, project evaluation/assessment, site visits, and placing consideration of the application on a future agenda for formal action, if required. The city shall not take any official action related to such a project until the DRI review process is completed and the city has had adequate time to consider the DRI review comments.
After the DRI review process is completed, the city may proceed with whatever action it deems appropriate regarding the proposed project, although it is encouraged to take the public finding and additional comments into consideration as it makes its decision.
If the project receives a negative public finding from the regional commission and the city approves said project or takes action to advance said project, the city shall notify the regional commission and the state department of community affairs of its action and identify all local requirements it has placed on the development that could mitigate any negative findings identified in the DRI review process.

If the hearing body determines from the evidence presented by the applicant has shown that the proposed application promotes the health, safety, morals, and general welfare under applicable criteria, then the application shall be granted, subject to those reasonable conditions as may be imposed by the hearing body on its own initiative or as may be recommended by the Planning Commission or the director. Otherwise, such application shall be denied.
