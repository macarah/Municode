b.
For a buffer 25 feet in width, minimum plantings shall include:
Overstory trees .....Three for every 100 feet;
Understory trees .....Six for every 100 feet;
Evergreen shrubs .....Ten for every 100 feet.
For less than 100 feet, the quantity for each type of planting shall be pro-rated accordingly after rounding up.
c.
For a buffer of 50 feet in width, minimum plantings shall include:
Overstory trees .....Four for every 100 feet;
Understory trees .....Five for every 100 feet;
Evergreen shrubs .....20 for every 100 feet.
For less than 100 feet, the quantity for each type of planting shall be pro-rated accordingly after rounding up.
d.
The height of the plant material, after installed, shall be:
1.
For overstory trees (indigenous to the area) .....Ten feet in height;
2.
For understory trees (indigenous to the area) .....Six feet in height;
3.
For evergreen shrubs (indigenous to the area) .....Three feet in height; and,
Shall produce a visual screen averaging six feet in height for all plant materials installed at the end of a single growing season.
e.
All required plantings shall be permanently maintained in sound, healthy growing condition and shall be replaced with new plant materials during the first year growing season whenever necessary to ensure continued compliance with applicable landscaping requirements.
f.
The building official shall be authorized to order the installation of additional plantings whenever he or she deems such additional plantings necessary to comply with the requirements of this section, and to order replacement of any vegetation removed in violation of subsection (c)(1) above.
(d)
A structural buffer shall be installed in compliance with the following requirements:
(1)
The building official shall be authorized to permit the installation of a structural buffer, as defined herein, in lieu of a planted buffer where because of space constraints or other reason(s) the requirement of a planted buffer would not be practical; the materials, location and dimensions of such fence must meet the following requirements and be approved by the building official.
(2)
Structural buffers may be fences or walls constructed of wood or masonry materials of at least six feet in height and include plantings along its length on the residential zone side of the structural buffer. Plantings installed shall be at least 50 percent of those required in subsection (c)(3)d. above.
(3)
Earthen berms may be constructed to a height of six feet and shall have slopes of a maximum of one foot rise in two horizontal feet. Thus a six foot high berm would have an overall minimum width of 24 feet (12 feet each side to accommodate the maximum slope). The berm shall have plant materials installed at the base of the berm and the berm itself shall be planted, or sod installed, with a permanent grass. The height of the berm may be reduced if a fence is installed along the crest of the berm, however an overall height of six feet must be achieved.
(e)
The building official shall be authorized to waive the buffer requirement along street rights-of-way where the installation of a buffer would not be practical because of proximity to the street or where visibility at an intersection may be impaired.

(a)
Size and spacing of curb cuts and other access points. In no case shall a curb cut or other access point be less than nine feet nor more than 50 feet in length. No two curb cuts or other access points shall be closer than 20 feet from each other except in residential zoning districts.

Location of curb cuts and other access points. At street intersections, no curb cut or other access point shall be located closer than (1) 20 feet from the intersecting point of the two street right-of-way or property lines involved (or extensions of such lines in case of a rounded corner) or (2) 25 feet from the intersection of the two curb lines involved (or extensions of such lines in case of a rounded corner), whichever is the least restrictive.
(c)
Access points in the vicinity of interchanges. In no case shall any curb cut or other access point be located closer than 200 feet to the intersecting point of a street right-of-way line with the right-of-way line of any limited access highway or interchange, including all portions of ramps, acceleration and deceleration lanes, merge lanes and other facilities specifically designed to facilitate traffic movement onto and off the limited access highway.
(d)
Permits for access onto state-owned rights-of-way. A permit must be obtained from the state department of transportation before curb cuts or any other point of access shall be authorized onto state-owned highway rights-of-way from abutting property.

Sec. 23-3-26. - Nonconforming structures.
Where a structure exists lawfully under these zoning regulations at the effective date of its adoption or amendment that could not be built under these zoning regulations by reason of restrictions on lot area, lot coverage, height, yards, location on the lot, or requirements other than use concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(a)
Any nonconforming structure or portion thereof shall not be enlarged or altered.

(c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions as to reconstruction, any residential structure or structures in any residential zone district may be rebuilt after destruction, except when destruction has occurred by the voluntary act of the owner. In the event of such rebuilding, all applicable district requirements, except as identified above, shall be met.
