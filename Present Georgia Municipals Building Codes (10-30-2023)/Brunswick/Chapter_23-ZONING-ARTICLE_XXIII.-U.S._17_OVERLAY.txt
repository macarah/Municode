ARTICLE XXIII. - U.S. 17 OVERLAY[2]

Footnotes:
--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 1057, § 1, adopted November 7, 2018, repealed the former Art. XXIII, §§ 23-23-1—23-23-10, and enacted a new Art. XXIII as set out herein. The former Art. XXIII pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1006, § 1, 11-19-2008.

Sec. 23-23-1. - Intent of overlay.
It is the intent of this overlay to create a parkway along U.S. Highway 17 from Spur 25 to the Sidney Lanier Bridge in order to improve the visual and economic condition along this section of U.S. 17. This section of roadway is commonly referred to as "Glynn Avenue."
A parkway is a wide, scenic road planted with trees. This corridor is deemed by the city commission to be important because so many visitors get their first impression of Brunswick while driving along U.S. 17. The scenic vistas of the marsh are inherently and economically valuable to the public, and visual clutter impedes aesthetically and economically favorable development of the parkway area. The visual quality of the corridor and the general nature of development along the corridor must be improved to encourage visitors to explore more of the city.
(Ord. No. 1057, § 1, 11-7-2018)

Sec. 23-23-6. - Pre-existing conditions.
(a)
Existing buildings and appurtenances that do not conform to the provisions of this Code may continue in the same use and form until a substantial modification occurs or is requested, at which time the planning director shall determine the provisions of this section that shall apply.
(b)
Existing buildings that have at any time received a certificate of occupancy shall not require upgrade to the current building code and when renovated may meet the standards of the code under which they were originally permitted.
(c)
The modification of existing buildings is permitted by right if such changes result in greater conformance with the specifications of this Code.

Where buildings exist on adjacent lots, the planning director may require that a proposed building match one or the other of the adjacent setbacks and heights rather than the provisions of this Code.
(e)
The restoration or rehabilitation of an existing building shall not require the provision of (1) parking in addition to that existing or (2) on-site stormwater retention/detention in addition to that existing. Existing parking requirements that exceed those for this Code may be reduced as provided by in Section 4.3 of the Overlay Code.
