ARTICLE XIV. - CP CONSERVATION-PRESERVATION DISTRICTS

Sec. 23-14-1. - Intent of district.
It is the intent of this article that the CP zoning district be established and maintained to preserve and/or control development within certain land, marsh and/or water areas of the City of Brunswick which serve as wildlife refuges, possess great natural beauty or are of historical significance, are utilized for recreational purposes, provide needed open space for the health and general welfare of the city's inhabitants, or are subject to periodic flooding. The regulations which apply within this district are designed to reserve such areas for the purposes outlined herein and to discourage any encroachment by residential, commercial, industrial or other uses capable of adversely affecting the relatively undeveloped character of the district.
