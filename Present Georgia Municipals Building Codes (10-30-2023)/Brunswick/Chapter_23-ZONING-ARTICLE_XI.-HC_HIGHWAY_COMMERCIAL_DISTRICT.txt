ARTICLE XI. - HC HIGHWAY COMMERCIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 23-11-1. - Intent of district.
It is the intent of this section that the HC zoning district be developed and reserved for commercial uses which primarily render a service or cater to tourists, vacationers, truckers, and the traveling public in general. The regulations which apply within this district are designed to encourage the formation and continuance of a compatible environment for highway oriented uses, insure adequate and properly designed means of ingress and egress, and to discourage any encroachment by industrial, residential or other uses capable of adversely affecting the specialized commercial character of the district.
