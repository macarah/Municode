(d)
Increased capitalization. A partnership or corporation holding a license may take on additional partners or shareholders, as the case may be, where it is determined that the additional capital furnished is to be used exclusively for additional inventory or expanded facilities of the business or for building new facilities and where it further appears that the other partners or shareholders will not receive any of the additional capital investment. Such additional partner or new stockholder must apply for a license and meet all requirements of a licensee, including approval by the city manager, before he shall be permitted to acquire such interest.

(b)
"Due cause" for the purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to:
(1)

Suspension or revocation of any state license required as a condition for the possession, sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages;
(4)
Material falsification of any fact given in an application for a license issued under this chapter or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor, any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this chapter shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented;
(5)
Failure to meet or maintain any standard prescribed by this chapter as a condition or qualification for holding a license;
(6)
Any other factor known to or discovered by the city whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any of the licensee's employees or any person holding an interest in a license, has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, local ordinance, or administrative regulations involving alcoholic beverages, gambling, narcotics, or disorderly conduct, including any sexual offense, under state law or local ordinances with respect to businesses licensed for on-premise consumption. With respect to this section, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violation was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity.
(c)
Notice of suspension or revocation proceedings shall be served on the person named as licensee in the application. Notice shall be in writing.

At the hearing the licensee shall have the right to represent itself or be represented by counsel, may cross-examine all witnesses offered by the city, and may call witnesses and present evidence in its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the hearing officer shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation.
(e)
The mayor and council shall make its final determination within ten days of the completion of the hearing.

(g)
The mayor and council may impose a fine, not to exceed $1,000.00, for each violation of this chapter and may condition reinstatement or renewal of the license on the licensee posting a performance bond, in an amount not to exceed $5,000.00. A second or subsequent violation, which occurs within three years from the date of the first violation may constitute grounds for suspension, revocation, and/or non-renewal of the license.
(h)
It shall be the duty of the chief of police to report to the commissioner of revenue, in the format designated by the commissioner and in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated for that purpose, any disciplinary action as defined in this chapter and O.C.G.A. § 3-3-2.1 against a licensee, the licensee's employee, or person holding a financial interest in the license.

(Ord. No. 21-17 , § 1, 1-3-2022)
Sec. 6-34. - Emergency suspension; all alcoholic beverage licenses.
The mayor and council is authorized to suspend the sale of alcoholic beverages under all licenses issued pursuant to this chapter during any state of emergency declared by the governor, any local emergency as defined by O.C.G.A. § 36-69-2 or for any other serious situation in which the mayor and council deems such emergency suspension necessary for the protection of the health and welfare of the citizens of the city. Such suspension may be made effective immediately and shall remain in force until the mayor and council determines the emergency is over or until the next regular meeting of the mayor and council, at which time the suspension shall cease unless the same is extended by affirmative action of the mayor and council.

(c)
Any holder of a license hereunder who shall begin the operation of the business authorized in the license, but who shall thereafter cease to operate the business as authorized in said license for six months, shall thereupon forfeit such license, which license shall be automatically cancelled without the necessity of any further action of the city unless an extension of time is granted by the city manager before the expiration of the six-month period for good cause shown.
