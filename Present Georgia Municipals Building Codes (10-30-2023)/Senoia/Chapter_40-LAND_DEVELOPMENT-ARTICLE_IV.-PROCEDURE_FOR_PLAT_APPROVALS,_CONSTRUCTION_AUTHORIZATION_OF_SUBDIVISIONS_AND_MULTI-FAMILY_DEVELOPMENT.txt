ARTICLE IV. - PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVALS, CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATION OF SUBDIVISIONS AND MULTI-FAMILY DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 40-51. - General requirements.
If a proposed development includes land to be subdivided, the development shall be subject to all requirements for the Senoia Zoning Ordinance, these land development regulations, and all applicable codes, ordinances and regulations of the city. The proposed development shall be designed to conform to the goals and objectives of the city's comprehensive plan, including its future land use element.
The following general principles for subdivision design shall be observed:
Lot arrangement. Side lot lines shall be at right angles (90 degrees) to the public right-of-way on which the lot fronts, or project radially on curved rights-of-way. Each lot shall front upon a dedicated public right-of-way having a minimum width of not less than 50 feet.
Building lines. Building lines shall conform to the zoning ordinance requirements.
Double-frontage lots. Access (driveway curb cuts) to lots having frontage on two public streets shall be restricted to the interior street.
Sewer service. Individual septic systems shall not be permitted where public sanitary sewer is accessible to the building lot. For purposes of this chapter, where public sewer is available in a public right-of-way adjoining the property or in an easement touching upon the property at any point, or within 250 feet of either of the foregoing, access shall be deemed to exist. Where a public sewer connection can be extended through an easement across adjoining private property to an existing sewer line within 250 feet of the property boundary, it shall be the duty of the property owner to seek such easement and cause a connection to be made and the owner, at its cost, shall exercise its best efforts to secure the necessary easement, to be dedicated to the city for future maintenance. Owners shall coordinate with the city their efforts to obtain easements and for approval of the design and installation of the sewer connection. All dwellings and structures intended for human occupancy of at least four hours per day shall be connected to public sewer whenever such service is or becomes accessible, at the property owner's expense. When connecting to public sewer, septic tanks shall be removed or properly filled to prevent future usage or liability.

Sec. 40-52. - Conceptual plan approval procedure.
(a)
Conceptual plat acceptance. All applicants proposing developments that require a subdivision of land shall submit 15 copies of a conceptual plat to the city administrator. Plats must be submitted a minimum of 30 calendar days prior to the planning commission meeting at which such plat shall be considered. All plats shall be presented on a scaled drawing having a minimum dimension of 17 inches by 22 inches and at a scale no larger than one inch equals 100 feet. Plats shall depict all adjacent streets and proposed streets, public water and sewer services, all lots and the proposed use(s) and a general indication of the storm drainage system. Plats that do not comply with these informational requirements shall not be considered until resubmitted in compliance. The city administrator shall inform the applicant of such noncompliance, in writing, within one week of conceptual plat submittal.
(b)
Conceptual plat review. Conceptual plats shall be reviewed by the public works director, city engineer and city planner. Plats shall be evaluated for conformance with city zoning ordinance, this chapter, and comprehensive plan. A report prepared by the city engineer summarizing his findings and a report prepared by the city planner summarizing the findings of city staff shall be presented to planning commission one week prior to their regular meeting.
(c)
Conceptual plat approval. Planning commission shall consider conceptual plats, applying the purposes and intent of this chapter the goals ands objectives of the comprehensive plan and the City of Senoia Short Term Work Program and other public documents that indicate the timing and location of public improvements and services as relate to the proposed development. Planning commission shall forward a written record to mayor and council recommending approval of the conceptual plat upon a finding that the plat conforms to these parameters. The commission shall forward a recommendation of denial upon a finding that the plat fails to conform to these parameters, specifying the areas of nonconformance. The commission may enable the applicant to generate information deemed by the commission as essential to evaluating plat conformance.
Upon receipt of a recommendation by the planning commission, mayor and council shall place the conceptual plat on the agenda of a regularly scheduled meeting of city council. In evaluating the plat, mayor and council shall consider the findings of the city engineer and city planner, as contained in a written report, the recommendations of planning commission and the parameters presented in section 40-51. The mayor and council shall approve the conceptual plat upon a finding that the plat conforms to these parameters; alternately, the council shall deny the plat upon a finding that the plat does not so conform, specifying in writing the nature of the nonconformance. Conceptual plat approval shall expire within a period of six-months immediately following action by council should the applicant fail to submit a preliminary plat conforming to the requirements of section 40-56 and such approval shall have no force or effect.

Preliminary plat approval. Planning commission shall review preliminary plats, applying the minimum requirements of this chapter, the zoning ordinance, and the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan as well as other public documents that indicate the timing and location of public improvements and services as relate to the proposed development. Planning commission shall forward a written record to mayor and council recommending approval of the preliminary plat upon a finding that the plat conforms to these regulations, ordinances and plans. The commission shall forward a recommendation of denial upon a finding that the plat fails to so conform, specifying the areas of nonconformance. The commission may table consideration of a preliminary plat for a maximum period of 45 days for the purpose of enabling the applicant to generate information deemed by the commission as essential to evaluating plat conformance or to revise the plat such that conformance with the city regulations, ordinances and plans is achieved.

Due to sign-space limitation, use road names that do not exceed 15 characters in length (excluding the street type).
(4)
Names must be easy to pronounce and should effect a positive connotation.
(5)
Double stree names are not favored and may be rejected; e.g. Deer Path Lane.
(6)
All street names must have an acceptable type; e.g. Road, Drive, Lane, Court.
(7)
Punctuation is not allowed; e.g. periods, hyphens, apostrophes.
(8)
Directional and numbers are not allowed; e.g. North Main Street, Four Corners Drive.
(9)
Names may incorporate the name of nearby cities if leading to such destination, e.g. Newnan Road.
(10)
Names should be pleasant sounding, appropriate and easy to read so that the public can communicate the name in an emergency situation.
(11)
A new road name should not begin with the name "New" or "Old" if the name has historically been in use or is found in the official street name index.
(12)
Where feasible, the name of the subdivision should be incorporated into the name of the primary entrance street in a way that is consistent with the other naming criteria listed herein.
(b)
The development director shall coordinate the names of streets and house numbers with the following Coweta County Departments; fire department, planning department, GIS, and E-911, and U.S. Post Office.
