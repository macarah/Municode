Arterial streets: These streets are intended to provide higher travel speeds between or within communities, or to and from collectors and expressways. Access is controlled so that only community significant land use may have direct access to these streets. Identified arterial streets: Stallings Rd., Standing Rock Rd., Ga. Hwy 16, Ga. Hwy. 85, Rockaway Rd., Luther Bailey Rd. and the intersection of Johnson St. and Seavy St. to Hwy. 85.
Collector streets: Collector streets connect residential streets to the highway system's major and higher arterials or provide access to nonresidential uses and arterials. Collectors form barriers between neighborhoods and are designed for higher speeds and traffic volumes than are residential streets. Collectors are classified as major collectors and minor collectors.
Major collector: The primary function is to carry traffic from most major intraurban trips over one mile, particularly during peak hours. These streets provide only limited access to adjacent land. This direct access is usually focused on major facilities, shopping centers or other significant traffic generators. Major collectors are usually designed with four travel lanes and may be either divided or undivided.
Minor collector: The primary function is to carry traffic for short to medium (one-half to one mile) intraurban trips. These streets receive traffic from residential streets and transmit it to major collectors and arterials. Minor collectors, spaced to relieve excessive traffic volumes on local streets, are commonly designed with two travel lanes.
Divided streets: Any street with a median greater than 100 feet in length separating the travel lanes. A divided street may be a major collector, minor collector, industrial, commercial or residential street.
Driveway: A vehicular access corridor privately owned and maintained. Residential driveways shall not serve more than two single-family residential lots.
Private street: Private street means any parcel of land set aside to provide access to a development and which will not be dedicated or deeded to the city. These streets shall be constructed to standards adopted by the city.
Public street: Public street shall mean any right-of-way dedicated or deeded to an accepted by the city for purposes of public travel. Public streets shall be constructed to standards adopted by the city.

Subdivision shall include all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building site, or other divisions for the purposes, whether immediate or future, of sale, gift, or building development and includes all division or development of land involving a new street or a change in an existing street. It shall also include resubdivision, the process of subdividing and the land or area subdivided; provided, however, division of land into parcels of five acres or more where no new street is involved are not included in this definition.
Substantial improvement shall mean any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either:
Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.
Tree shall mean a woody plant which has a single or combined trunk with a caliper (diameter) of eight or more inches five feet above the ground, or any flowering ornamental woody plant having a caliper of two or more inches five feet above the ground.
