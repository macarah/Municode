(Ord. of 7-1-2002, § 1003)
Sec. 40-194. - Drainage.
(a)
Policies. It is hereby declared to be public policy to:
(1)
Recognize the necessity of joint action where feasible by the city and the development industry in resolution of existing drainage problems and prevention of their worsening or recurrence;
(2)
Work in cooperative relationship with the development industry to accomplish the above-state objective by encouraging through this chapter and other public actions the development of fewer but larger major retention facilities and the incremental resolution of existing drainage problems on a priority basis in concert with private development activities;
(3)
Maintain where feasible, the natural environment of city streams through reduction of flow quantities resulting from new development, and where feasible, restore the flood plain to its natural functional purpose to resolve existing flooding problems, but recognize the necessity of using urban streams for stormwater runoff in those situations where maintenance of the natural stream environment would result in continuation or worsening of flooding conditions;
(4)
Incrementally assume maintenance responsibility for the public drainage system on lands accepted by the city;
(5)
Require of the development industry the responsibility to maintain the functioning of the storm drainage system during the development process;
(6)
Encourage the construction of joint retention ponds serving several residential properties, which can be accepted for maintenance by the city upon completion of project development. The city encourages (where engineering judgment so warrants) the location of these retention facilities off the site of the property under development and may participate where it is in the general public's best interest in the construction of major retention facilities which would serve not only the needs of the property under development, but would assist in resolving existing flooding problems;
(7)
Encourage innovative design solutions to the effective retention of runoff;
(8)
Encourage accommodating runoff from residential properties or between individual single-family lots through underground piping rather than open surface drainage swells and minimize cross drains from streets to natural drainage ways by longitudinal piping or by retaining within the streets, for as long as reach as commonly accepted standards or engineering judgment permit, runoff to a point of discharge not directly individual single-family lots.
(b)
Standards.
(1)
All engineering design items for storm drainage and erosion control and sedimentation control and delineation of the intermediate regional flood plains shall meet the applicable minimum requirements of published design standards of the city, available from the city engineer. Rainfall intensities used in hydrologic computations shall not be less than shown by applicable rainfall curves published by the natural weather service for the affected area.
(2)
A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all development and construction which will increase the peak rate of runoff from the site by more than one cubic foot per second for a ten-year frequency storm and shall not apply to individual single-family lots of less than two acres which are not a part of a platted subdivision.
(3)
The release rate of stormwater from all developments where retention is required shall not exceed 90 percent of the peak stormwater runoff rate from the area in its existing state for all intensities up to and including the 100-year frequency for all duration's of rainfall.
(4)
The drainage system being developed shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of 100-year design frequency based on the existing land use plan.
(5)
The live retention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the basis of the 100-year frequency rainfall as published by the national weather service for the affected areas. The retention system required shall be that necessary to handle the runoff of a 100-year rainfall, for any and all duration's from the proposed development, with a release rate that does not exceed the approved release rate during the same duration storm. Retention control structures and other drainage improvements shall be located and designed to prevent erosion damage to adjacent property owners.
(6)
When the developer requests and the city engineer agrees that development and construction of nonresidential projects are too small, or that engineering and economic factors make combines retention or other drainage facilities more practical, the city may authorize the joint construction of these facilities to serve two or more properties by two or more developers. Where joint retention facilities service two or more properties are approved for construction, no use of land or occupancy of buildings within the properties served by these facilities shall be permitted until completion of the retention facility, and the owner(s) of the joint retention facility have submitted a written agreement to the city showing who is responsible for the maintenance of that facility.
(7)
The following requirements shall apply to the installation, development and maintenance of all retention and sedimentation control facilities designed for temporary storage of stormwater runoff:
a.
These facilities shall be located on tracts of land, designated for this use on the recorded plat, with sufficient area around the perimeter to provide access for maintenance purposes and shall be immediately adjacent to or be provided with an access easement to a public street. The access easement shall provide at least 20 feet of width outside of aboveground obstructions including trees, headwalls, weirs, settling basins or other drainage structures.
b.
Perforated standpipes or a french drain, or other methods which will achieve equal performance to prevent standing of water and inadequate shall be installed within all these facilities.
c.
Except as provided in (7)d., the property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of the retention facilities during grading, construction, and following final approval or the completed project. This maintenance shall be binding on future owners, successors and assigns of the property.
d.
In the case of platted residential subdivisions, the city shall assume maintenance responsibility after the release of the maintenance agreement for subdivision streets. Upon completion of developer maintenance all retention ponds shall have a positive slope to the outlet in order to facilitate complete drainage.
(8)
Special drainage system maintenance requirements.
a.
No impoundment of water which retains in excess of one-half acre of runoff shall be altered without first obtaining a development permit, which shall only be issued after competent engineering studies provided by the developer show that this removal will not adversely affect downstream properties.
b.
Trash, garbage, construction materials, construction by-products or other debris shall not be deposited in any part of the drainage system.
c.
No restrictions or barriers, including fences, may be placed in the drainage systems without first obtaining a development permit.
(9)
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
(Ord. of 7-1-2002, § 1004)
Sec. 40-195. - Flood control.
(a)
Policies. It is hereby declared to be public policy to:
(1)
Minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions;
(2)
Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(b)
Standards.
(1)
In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
a.
All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
b.
All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
c.
All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
d.
All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems;
e.
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designated to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters;
f.
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
g.
Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure, which is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter.
(2)
Land uses within the intermediate regional flood plain shall not diminish or restrict the capacity of the channels or flood plains of the stream, its tributaries, drainage ditches or any other drainage facilities or systems and shall not increase the IRF elevation or velocity or concentration of flow in downstream areas. If the required hydrologic studies reveal that a request for filling or grading within the intermediate flood plain would overload the capacity of the channel downstream or increase flood stages upstream, the development permit shall be denied unless equivalent flow and storage capacity is replaced and maintained by the owner within the intermediate regional flood plain. Altered sections of the intermediate regional flood plain shall have a positive slope so as to provide positive drainage back to the stream flow line and this section must be maintained by the owners in perpetuity so as to prevent or remove silt build-up.
(3)
In residential districts, not less than 70 percent of the minimum lot area, as established by applicable zoning district development standards, shall be above the intermediate regional flood elevation contours.
(4)
All new buildings permitted after the effective date of this chapter and located on property contiguous to the intermediate regional flood plain shall be constructed so that all portions of the structure, including the basement floor or crawl areas, shall be not less than three feet above the intermediate regional flood elevations. No new development will be allowed in the intermediate regional flood plain. Any substantial improvement to an existing structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated not less than six inches above the intermediate regional flood elevation.
(5)
The profile elevation of the centerline of all public streets shall be constructed a minimum of one foot above the intermediate regional flood elevation contours. Exceptions to this provision may be granted by the city engineer in cases where the construction of the street elevation below the intermediate regional flood elevation contours would improve drainage or reduce the effects of flooding.
(6)
When on or off-site debris has accumulated within an immediate regional flood plain in such a manner as to interfere with the flow of water so as to increase the risk of hazardous inundation of upstream properties adjacent to the intermediate regional flood plain, the city shall require the owner of the property where this debris was generated, if its source can be identified, to clear and remove the debris so as to permit the free flow of water.
(7)
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
(8)
Flood ways. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as flood ways. Since the flood way is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments are prohibited unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge;
b.
All new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions (see subsection (b)(1) above).
(9)
"As-built" elevation certifications must be obtained for all future developments if land is to be removed from the hazard area. A certification from a registered professional engineer or land surveyor certifying as to the actual elevations of the development or structures must be obtained after the changes occur.
(10)
Any relocation or realignment of river and stream channels shall be prohibited if it would reduce the capacity with respect to the base flood elevation or less, significantly alter water flow characteristics or create a flood hazard. Provisions must be incorporated in the proposal to ensure that adequate maintenance will be provided for the altered watercourse. Adjacent communities and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources must be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse if it is determined that an adjacent community could be affected, and evidence of such notification submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(11)
When base flood elevation data or flood way data have been provided by the flood hazard boundary map, then the city engineer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and flood way data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this section.
(12)
All wastewater treatment plants shall be located a minimum of three feet vertically and 200 feet horizontally from the boundary of the intermediate regional flood elevation.
