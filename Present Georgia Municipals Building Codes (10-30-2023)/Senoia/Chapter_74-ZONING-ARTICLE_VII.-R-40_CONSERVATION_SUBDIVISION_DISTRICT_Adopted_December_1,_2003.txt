Preserve unique and sensitive landscapes and site features by locating new building lots outside of such areas;
(f)
Foster clustering of dwellings and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils to reduce the amount of paved surfaces and utilities;
(g)
Minimize erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation;
(h)
Preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
(i)
Conserve scenic vistas from encroachment by development;
(j)
Reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of dwelling with direct access to and views of greenspace;
(k)
Retain and protect greenspace within residential developments for aesthetic, watershed protection and nonstructural stormwater management purposes;
(l)

Sec. 74-115. - Greenspace protection standards.
modified
In utilizing the R-40 conservation subdivision district, the proposed design shall limit disturbance of all greenspace identified in the required conservation plan submitted in accordance with section 74-118(a) of this article.
(a)
Applicant shall demonstrate maximum conservation of scenic views from public roads and neighboring residential properties, utilizing existing vegetation, structures or topography or providing landscaping to screen the proposed development from view. At its sole discretion, mayor and council may reduce screening requirements where applicant submits individual building plans with sufficient detail to demonstrate, in terms of how buildings may be viewed from public roads or neighboring residential properties, reasonable maintenance of the tract's traditional rural character. Distance from public roads or neighboring residential properties may also be considered as a mitigating factor in review of building plans.
(b)
Applicant shall demonstrate compliance with all applicable state and/or federal regulation of streams and wetlands. Copies of all documentation concerning any proposed activity requiring submission of a wetlands delineation report, stream or wetland encroachment permit, or mitigation plan to the Georgia Department of Environmental Protection and/or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shall be submitted to the City of Senoia at the time of submission to the agency or agencies having jurisdiction. Receipt of such documentation shall not be a prerequisite for plan approval; however, approval shall be conditioned upon ultimate demonstration of compliance with all applicable regulation(s).
(c)
Existing stands of trees and individual trees having a DBH of eight inches (8") or greater and other significant natural features, including streams, ridge lines, steep slopes, peaks and rock outcroppings, shall be inventoried. Such features shall be preserved to the greatest feasible degree. Removal or disturbance of such landscape features shall not occur on more than 25 percent of the total area they occupy, except where mayor and council are satisfied that overall community planning and greenspace protection objectives are best served through allowance of additional disturbance. For the purposes for this section, the extent of area occupied by any tree or tree mass shall be measured from the outermost drip line of such tree or stands of trees.
(d)
Inappropriate alteration of the natural terrain shall be prohibited. Developers of conservation subdivisions shall achieve a lot and street layout and grading plan that minimizes such alteration.

Sec. 74-118. - Greenspace management provisions.
(a)
Greenspace management plan. Any application for rezoning to the R-40 conservation subdivision district shall include a long term plan for management of the greenspace that is to be created as part of the development. Such plan shall include maintenance and management of any wastewater disposal, water supply, storm-water management or any other common facilities which may be located within or adjacent to greenspace. Such a plan shall also include a narrative describing:
(1)
The manner in which the greenspace and any facilities included therein will be owned and by whom the greenspace will be managed and maintained;
(2)
The conservation, land management and agricultural techniques and practices that will be used to conserve and perpetually protect the greenspace, including conservation plan(s) approved by mayor and council;
(3)
The professional and personnel resources that will be necessary to maintain and manage the property;
(4)
The planned nature of public or private access to the greenspace; and
(5)
The funding source that will be available for such perpetual management, preservation and maintenance.
The greenspace management plan shall be recorded in Office of the Clerk of Superior Court of Coweta County together with the final subdivision plat. The applicant shall provide a draft of the greenspace management plan with sufficient detail to demonstrate feasible compliance with the provisions of this article with the filing of the preliminary plat submission. Mayor and council may require that appropriate management contracts be established as evidence of the ability to adhere to the provisions of the approved management plan as a condition of approval. The greenspace management plan shall contain a provision that prohibits any amendment without written application to, and approval of, mayor and council to allow for changing circumstances inherent to the perpetual management of land. Approval of such application by mayor and council shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided the proposed amendment is feasible and consistent with the purposes of preservation of greenspace as set forth in this article and provided further that the plan for such amendment avoids the likelihood that the obligation for management and maintenance of the land may become a responsibility of the city without the consent of mayor and council.
(b)
Provisions for maintenance of greenspace upon default.
(1)
In the event the legal entity holding title to greenspace shall, at any time after establishment of a development containing designated greenspace, fail to maintain such land in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the greenspace management plan, the city may serve written notice upon the owner of record, setting forth the manner in which the owner of record has failed to maintain the greenspace land in reasonable condition.
(2)
Failure to adequately maintain the greenspace in accordance with the approved greenspace management plan constitutes a violation of this zoning ordinance. The zoning administrator is hereby authorized to give notice, by personal service or by United States mail, to the owner or occupant of any violation, directing the owner to remedy the same within 20 calendar days.
(3)
Upon default by any entity responsible for maintenance of greenspace and/or associated facilities, where such maintenance is required under the terms of an approved greenspace management plan, any subdivision and/or land development plan for the property, zoning approval for the property, or under any applicable requirement of any city ordinances, permits, approvals or where such maintenance is otherwise necessary to abate a nuisance, emergency, hazard or other condition threatening persons, property, public health, safety or welfare, the city may, but shall not be obligated to, upon 20 calendar days (or lesser time period in instances of emergency) written notice to the entity responsible to perform the necessary maintenance and otherwise remedy the condition set forth in the city's notice, enter upon the greenspace, accessing the same through any other lands of such entity as may be necessary to correct the condition provided in the city's notice. Within 30 calendar days, the responsible entity shall pay any and all costs incurred by the city in connection with such action upon written demand by the city. Upon failure of the responsible entity to pay such costs by the time required, there shall be added interest at the rate of 18 percent per annum as well as costs incurred by the city in collection of same. The city may also lien other property of the entity, if any, for the full amount due, plus interest, and foreclose such lien in the same manner as liens for taxes, or make demand upon any bond or letter of credit held in favor of the city.
