Sec. 30-26. - Purpose and intent; definition; sound measurement standard.
(a)
Purpose and intent. This article is enacted to protect, preserve and promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Senoia, Georgia, through the control of noise, a recognized form of environmental pollution. It is the intent of this article to establish objective standards that will reduce excessive community noises, which are harmful and otherwise detrimental to individuals and to the community in the enjoyment of life and property and in the conduct of business. It is not the intent of this article to regulate noise based upon its source, but based upon objective volume limitations at objective distances from the source, which for purposes of this article intentionally vary based upon the time of day and reasonable expectations of persons occupying the area during the relevant time period. It is not the intent of this article to regulate speech, under either the Federal or Georgia Constitutions. This article has been narrowly tailored as a content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation to serve a significant governmental interest while leaving open ample opportunity for communication.
(b)
Definition of "noise". For purposes of this article, "noise" means a sound or sounds of any kind, that is repetitive or continuous, and of sufficient duration, that a person of reasonable auditory sensitivity would consider loud, unpleasant, unexpected, or undesirable.
(c)
Sound measurement standards. For the purposes of this article, "plainly audible" shall mean any sound emanating from a specific sound-producing source which can be heard from the distances set forth below, using the following sound measurement standards: Measurement shall be by the auditory senses of a person standing at a distance no less than the required minimum distance from the source of the sound. Inasmuch as the limitation on noise is neutral as to the content of the message, if any, generated or conveyed by its source, words and phrases need not be discernable. For music and other noise, bass reverberations are included.

Tree save areas according to city ordinances, conditions of zoning, use permit or variance approval, and/or this article.
Re-vegetation means the replacement of trees and landscape plant materials to satisfy the minimum tree density and landscape requirements, as determined by the city ordinances, condition of zoning, use permit or variance approval, or this article.
Roots means:
(1)
Feeder roots. A complex system of small annual roots growing outward and predominantly upward from the system of "transport roots." These roots branch four or more times to form fans or mats of thousands of fine, short, non-woody tips. Many of these small roots and their multiple tips are two-tenths to one-millimeter or less in diameter and less than one to two millimeters long. These roots constitute the major fraction of a tree's root system surface area and are the primary sites of absorption of water and nutrients
(2)
Major woody roots. First order of tree roots originating at the "root collar" and growing horizontally in the soil to a distance of between three and 15 feet from the tree's trunk. These roots branch and decrease in diameter to give rise to "rope roots." The primary functions of major woody roots include anchorage, structural support, the storage of food reserves, and the transport of minerals and nutrients.
(3)
Rope roots. An extensive network of woody second order roots arising from major woody roots, occurring within the surface 12 to 18 inches of local soils, and with an average size ranging from one-quarter to one-inch in diameter. The primary function of rope roots is the transport of water and nutrients and the storage of food reserves.
(4)
Transport roots. The system or framework of tree roots comprised of major woody roots and rope roots.
Root collar means the point of attachment of major woody roots to the tree trunk, usually at or near the ground line and associated with a marked swelling of the tree trunk.
Root respiration means an active process occurring throughout the feeder root system of trees and involving the consumption of oxygen and sugars with the release of energy and carbon dioxide. Root respiration facilitates the uptake and transport of minerals and nutrients essential for tree survival.
Setback means a space between a property line and the line to which a building or specified structure may be constructed.
Soil compaction means a change in soil physical properties, which includes an increase in soil weight per unit volume and a decrease in soil pore space. Soil compaction is caused by repeated vibrations, frequent traffic and weight. As related to tree roots, compacted soil can cause physical root damage, a decrease in soil oxygen levels with an increase in toxic gasses, and can be impervious to new root development.
State waters means any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells, and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of the state which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation.
Thinning means selective cutting or removal of timber. A minimum of 80 D.B.H. per acre must remain.
Timber harvesting means the felling of timber products (pulp wood, etc.). The term "timber harvesting" may include both clear cutting and thinning of timber.
Tree means:
Tree. Any self-supporting woody perennial plant, which has a trunk diameter of two inches or more measured at a point six inches above the ground level and which normally obtains a height of at least ten feet at maturity, usually with one main stem or trunk and many branches.
Heritage tree. A tree, which is designated upon approval by the tree committee or authorized agent(s) to be of notable historical value or interest because of its age, size, or historical association.
Specimen tree. Any tree, which has been determined by the city arborist to be of high value because of its type, size, age, or other professional criteria, and has been so designated according to administrative standards established by the city council.
Stand of specimen trees. A contiguous grouping of trees which has been determined to be of value by the city arborist or authorized designee(s).
(1)
A relatively mature even-aged stand.
(2)
A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature.
(3)
A stand of historical significance.
(4)
A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality.
Tree preservation ordinance means the ordinance from which this article is derived, approved and adopted by the city council to provide standards for the protection, preservation and replacement of trees regulated and enforced by the city arborist in conjunction with the planning and zoning committee or designated agent(s) through development and construction permits and processes.
Tree protection plan or TPP means a plan to be submitted as part of the land disturbance process. This plan will include tree protection details, spatial limits, and implementation schedule as outlined in section 30-102 and appendices.
Tree save area means all areas designated for the purpose of meeting tree density requirements, saving specimen trees, and/or preserving natural buffers.
Tributary means any perennial stream (or portion thereof) within the affected area that is portrayed as a solid blue line on the United States Geological Survey 7.5 Quadrangle Maps, 1968 edition, or other perennial streams as identified by the city.
Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.
Zoning regulations means the zoning resolution of the city as amended or such regulations subsequently adopted by the city council inclusive of conditions of zoning, use permit or variance approval established pursuant thereto.
All other terms. All other words or phrases as appropriate to the context of their uses shall be interpreted as defined in the zoning regulations.

Permit procedures.
(1)
All applications for a land disturbance permit shall provide a tree protection plan and other documentation as required and as applicable for all areas of the tract of land within a protected zone. All applications and required supplemental information shall be submitted to city hall. [The tree protection plan may be separate from or included with the landscape plan.]
(2)
All tree protection plans (TPP) and related documentation shall be reviewed by the city arborist for conformance to the provisions of these regulations and either approved, returned, for revisions, or denied within 30 days of receipt. If denied or returned for revisions the reasons for denial or revision shall be annotated on the TPP or stated in writing.
(3)
Issuance of a valid land disturbance permit shall constitute an approval of the required tree protection plan and shall indicate conformance to the provisions of these regulations.

The application shall be subject to the approval of the city arborist or designated agent before any trees are to be removed from the site. Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to allow the removal of vegetation in a natural, undisturbed buffer required by the zoning regulations.
(2)
When no trees are present in the protected zone or when disturbance of any portion of the protected zone is approved, it shall be the responsibility of the owner/developer to re-vegetate said areas (in which improvements are not constructed) with trees or other plant materials subject to zoning regulations or, in lieu thereof, administrative standards.
(3)
Not withstanding any of the other requirements of these regulations, it shall be unlawful to remove a specimen tree without the express written consent of the city arborist or authorized agent(s). Administrative standards have been established for the identification, preservation and protection of specimen trees.

The city arborist or designated agent shall approve an application for the removal of a protected or specimen tree provided at least one of the following conditions are met:
• The location of the tree prevents the opening of reasonable and necessary vehicular traffic lanes;
• The location of the tree prevents the construction of utility lines or drainage facilities, which may not be feasibly relocated;
• The location of the tree prevents reasonable access to the property, if no alternative access exists;
• Allowing the tree to remain would impose an economic burden upon the owner of the property entirely out of proportion to with the benefit gained by retaining the tree;
• The tree is diseased, dead or dying to the point that repair or restoration is not practical or the disease may be transmitted to other trees;
• There is no reasonable assurance that if the tree is saved with proper construction precautions, it will continue to live as an asset to the site.

The city administrator or designated agent(s) is the issuing authority and shall have the power to withhold all permits, including, but not limited to, final certificates of occupancy, building permits and all permits on the subject site until it is determined by the issuing authority that the site complies with this article and the provisions of the formal plan approved by the county.
(i)
Inspections. The city arborist is the issuing authority and may cause inspection of compliance to be made periodically by it's designated agent(s) during the course of the project and shall make a final inspection following the completion of the work. Applicants shall cooperate with the issuing authority in conducting such inspections.
The city arborist shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this article, including but not limited to the power to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land disturbing or tree removal activities.
The city administrator is authorized to design and implement an inspection program involving private inspectors acceptable to the department.
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent who requests entry for the purpose of inspection and who presents appropriate identification, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
(j)
Notice of violation. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person, firm, or corporation has:
(1)
Engaged in land disturbing or other activities, which have resulted in the removal of trees; or
(2)
Failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a validly issued permit, then a written notice of violation shall be served upon the property owner or the agent of record.
Where a person, firm, or corporation has engaged in land disturbing or tree removal activities without having first secured a permit therefore in violation of this article, notices under the provisions of this article may be served upon the person in charge or any person representing the person in charge on the site. All construction and land disturbance activity shall be discontinued until the necessary measures to achieve compliance have been fulfilled.
The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the permit and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed
If the person, firm, or corporation engaged in land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he/she shall be subject to citation for violation of this article.

(m)
Bonding. The city will evaluate all development projects (excluding timber harvesting) requesting property clear cutting. If upon completion of the site evaluation, the city arborist deems it appropriate to allow property clear cutting activities; a bond will be required. The bond will be required by the city as a mechanism to cover any potential cost associated with re-vegetation of the clear-cut property in the event of property abandonment.
The required bond amount will be 100 percent of the total cost for replanting trees to satisfy the density standards for the project site. A tree replacement cost obtained from a plant nursery will be provided to the city with the clear-cut request and the bond amount will be based on the tree replacement cost, the city reserves the right to request additional replacement cost if deemed appropriate. The city will hold the bond until the project activity, including tree replacement to satisfy the site density requirements, is completed. If upon issuing the land disturbance permit, the property is clear-cut and there are no construction or development activities conducted within six months, the city will attempt to contact the property owner (via certified mail) for a project update. Should the property owner not respond within 30 days of receipt of the status request, the bond will be used to re-vegetate the project site.
(n)

• A lesser size tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a project or landscape.
Specimen tree stands. A contiguous grouping of trees which has been determined to be of value by the city's authorized agent(s). Determination is based upon one of the following criteria:
• A mature even-aged stand.
• A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature.
• A stand of historical significance.
• A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality.
(b)
Methods of tree protection.
(1)
Planning consideration. Tree space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the development process. The root system of trees can easily go beyond the dripline of the tree canopy. The root system within the dripline region is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Disturbance within this zone can directly affect a tree's chances for survival. To protect these critical root zones the following standards shall apply:
• The protective zone of specimen trees, heritage trees, stands of trees or otherwise designated tree save areas shall include no less that the total area beneath the tree(s) canopy as defined by the farthest canopy of the tree(s) plus a minimum of three additional feet. In some instances, the city arborist or authorized agent(s) may require a protective zone up to ten feet outside the dripline area. (See appendix A—Typical critical root zone.)
• Layout of the project site utility and grading plans must accommodate the required tree protective zones. Utilities must be placed along corridors between protective zones.
• Construction site activities such as parking, material storage, bury pits, concrete washout, burn hole placement, etc., shall not be allowed within tree protection zones.
• No disturbance shall occur within the protective zone of tree save areas.
(2)
Protective barriers. Protective tree fencing shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely surrounding the critical root zones, plus a minimum of three additional feet of all specimen trees, heritage trees, stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones, prior to any land disturbance. Acceptable tree fencing procedures:
• A minimum of four feet high, constructed in a post and rail configuration. A two-inch by four-inch post and a double one-inch by four-inch rail is recommended.
• Four-foot orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing.
• Any deviation from the requirements listed above must be authorized by the city arborist or designated agent(s).
• All tree protection fences must be accompanied by "keep out" or "tree save" signage.
• All tree protection zones shall be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted visibly on exterior sides of the fenced in area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. Signs requiring subcontractor compliance with tree protection standards are required at all site entrances.
• A stop work order or notice of violation will issued if project is found to be out of compliance with the tree protection/landscape plan. A copy of the approved tree protection/landscape plan shall be attached to all building permits to be checked by each inspector (building, electrical, plumbing, etc.)
• All specimen trees, heritage trees, stands of trees or otherwise designated tree protection zones must be protected from silt.
Silt fencing reinforced with wire mesh fencing must be placed along the outer uphill edge of tree protective zones at the land disturbance interface.
Silt fencing should be backed by 12 gauge, two-inch by four-inch wire mesh fencing in areas of steep slope. (Steep slopes are defined at greater than 3H:IV).
All erosion control measures must comply with city standards.
• All tree fencing and erosion control barriers must be installed prior to and maintained throughout the land disturbance process and building construction and may not be removed until certificate of occupancy is issued, and approved by the city administrator or designated agent(s).
(3)
Re-vegetation—Tree replacement.
a.
The replacement of trees to satisfy the conditions of zoning, or this article, shall occur under the following conditions:
• To establish the minimum tree density requirements for the site.
• Where grading occurs outside the buildable portion of the lot.
• If the lot's buildable area leaves no protected zone.
• If no trees are present within an existing zone.
• Where specimen trees or stands of trees within the buildable portion of the lot are to be removed.
• Where specimen trees or stands of trees and trees within otherwise designated protective zones have been irreparably damaged or removed through land disturbance or construction activities.
b.
The spacing of replacement trees must be compatible with special limitations and with responsible consideration towards potential species size. The following criteria shall be used to determine which trees are to be retained, removed and where trees are to be located for replacement:
POSITIVE CRITERIA:
• A species that is long-lived;
• A species that is native to the area;
• The hardiness of the tree;
• A low incidence of exfoliating bark, branch drop, and pruning;
• The protection of buildings from wind, sun, and other climatic considerations. The encouragement of wildlife residence;
• The suitability of size and maturity to the tree's function;
• The ability to retain soil and erosion;
• The ability to reduce noise;
• Draught resistant.
NEGATIVE CRITERIA:
• Susceptibility to insect and disease attack and to air and water pollution;
• Existence of disease, rot, or other damage to the individual tree.
c.
Where the city arborist or designated agent has determined that site spatial constraints result in the inability to provide tree density, as many trees as possible must be planted on site. The remaining balance of trees must be allocated to the tree replacement fund.
(4)
Tree replacement fund. Arrangements will be made through the city arborist. The following criteria apply:
• Tree replacement cost obtained from three plant nurseries must be provided for approval and the tree replacement cost will be based on the average of these estimates.
• The required replacement fee will be 100 percent of the total cost to replant the balance of trees that were unable to be planted to satisfy the site density requirements.
( Ord. No. 01-08, 12-6-2001 )
ARTICLE V—APPENDICES
BUFFER STANDARDS FOR MAJOR THOROUGHFARES
In order to maintain and enhance aesthetic standards in the city, the city has determined that buffer standards need to be adopted and enforced along its community collector roads. These roads are Rockaway Road, Highway 16, Highway 85, Stallings Road from city line to Matthews Street, Pylant Road from city line to Clarke's Street, Rockhouse Road, and Luther Bailey Road.
Other benefits associated with these regulations are:
• Enhanced property values.
• Reduced soil erosion, storm-water management costs and flooding potential.
• Moderation of microclimates.
• Improved air and water quality.
• Mitigation of noise and glare.
• Energy conservation through reduced heating and cooling.
The following buffer standards shall apply to all residential and nonresidential development along these highways:
(A)
Residential buffers. A continuous 60-foot-wide (minimum) greenbelt buffer shall be preserved or established for any residential development adjacent to a collector road. The natural tree/landscape is to be preserved wherever possible.
(B)
Nonresidential buffers. A continuous 50-foot-wide tree-save/landscape buffer shall be preserved or established for any nonresidential development adjacent to an arterial highway. The natural vegetation is to be preserved wherever possible.
(C)
Special conditions and exceptions.
(1)
The required tree-save/landscape buffer for any nonresidential property may be reduced as follows, subject to the approval of the city landscape architect and the planning commission:
A.
A buffer may be reduced from ten feet, provided the developer installs additional landscaping that amounts to at least ten-percent of the caliper inches of the trees required for the entire site by the landscape ordinance.
B.
A buffer may be reduced from 15 feet, provided the developer installs additional landscaping that, amounts to at lease 15 percent of the caliper inches of the trees required for the entire site by the landscape ordinance.
(2)
The buffer requirements for subsections (a) and (b) above shall not apply to any existing lot adjacent to a community collector road unless the zoning of the property is changed or there is a major change in the intensity of the existing use.
(3)
The buffer requirements for subsections (a) and (b) above shall not apply to any existing lot adjacent to an arterial highway if that lot is less than one-acre in area or has an average depth of 200 feet or less (measured from the right-of-way of the adjacent arterial highway). For these lots, the minimum buffer shall be not less than 20 feet wide.
(4)
For any existing lot which is adjacent to a community collector road and which has an average depth of between 200 feet and 220 feet (measured from the right-of-way line of the adjacent a community collector road), the required buffer width may be established at 20 feet plus the number of feet the average depth of the lot exceeds 200 feet.
(5)
For lots that front more than one community collector road, the buffer standards shall apply for each front.

  APPENDIX G. TREE AND SITE RELATED DISTURBANCES
Tree protection zones, specimen trees or stands of trees designated to be saved must be protected from the following damages which may occur during all phases of land disturbance and construction processes, Methods of tree protection and disturbance prevention are provided in section 30-101(b)(2).
• Direct physical root damage.
• Indirect root damage.
• Trunk and crown disturbances.
A.
Direct physical root damage most frequently occurs during site clearing and grading operations, where transport or feeder roots are cut, torn, or removed.
1.
Transport and feeder roots tend to tangle and fuse among the roots of adjacent trees. The removal of trees with heavy machinery along the outer periphery of a tree save area can result in considerable damage within the tree save area.
2.
The most substantial form of root damage for all root types occurs in the form of cut roots. Roots are cut in grade reduction or from trenching for underground utilities, sanitary sewer, or storm sewer lines.
3.
A more subtle form of root damage is the loss of feeder roots. Feeder roots normally occur within the organic layer and the surface four inches of topsoil, subsequently, these roots can be easily damaged by the track action from a single bulldozer pass. The stripping of topsoil within a tree's critical root zone can totally eliminate its feeder root system.
B.
Indirect root damage through site modification can result from positive grade changes, temporary storage of fill material, sedimentation of erosion materials, soil compaction, and soil chemical changes.
• Positive grade changes from fill and sedimentation causes a decrease in soil oxygen levels. An increase in soil carbon dioxide and other toxic gases can also occur, leading to large areas of anaerobic soil conditions and causing a decrease in the root respiration process, which is essential for the uptake and transport of mineral and nutrients.
• Anaerobic soil conditions are also produced by soil compaction, the increase in soil bulk density with a decrease in soil pore space. Compacted soil is also impervious to root penetration, and thus inhibits root development. Soil compaction is generally caused by the weight and vibrations of heavy machinery, vehicle parking, and the storage of fill and/or construction material within the critical root zones of trees.
• Changes in soil chemistry will adversely affect tree survival. The most frequent occurrence is the change (decrease) in soil acidity by concrete washout. Most trees native to the county area prefer slightly acid soils; concrete residues are highly basic. The leakage or spillage of toxic material such as fuels or paints can be fatal for trees.
C.
Trunk and crown disturbance are generally mechanical in nature and are either caused directly by clearing and grading machinery, or indirectly by debris being cleared and falling into trees marked for protection.
• Common forms of damage include stripped bark and cambium, split trunks, and broken limbs.
• Damage also occurs for the posting of signs such as building permits or survey markers on trees.
• Indirect damage can be caused by the placement of burn holes of debris fires too close to trees. The possible range of damage includes scorched trunks with some cambial dieback, the loss of foliage due to evaporative heat stress (leaf desiccation), and completely burned trunk and crowns.

APPENDIX K. PROTECTIVE FENCING
OPEN SPACE DESIGN GUIDELINES
While ordinances provide basic development standards, details of aesthetic and other criteria of appropriateness often become the responsibility of planning commissions or zoning boards.
The following "considerations for open space guidelines" are proposed to enable local planning commissions and zoning boards to develop and adopt their own design guidelines. Each community is unique, and there is no set of one-size-fits-all guidelines.
Map A represents an aerial view of a 75-acre site with property lines indicated and will serve as a base map for examples in "considerations." The tract would yield a maximum of 15 lots upon conventional subdivision in an agricultural zone with a minimum lot size of five acres. Map B shows a stereotypical build out plan. Geographical constraints and the developer's desire for one super lot, yield a total of 13 lots.
The open space option, in contrast, would allow a developer to take advantage of a density bonus to achieve a total of 30 units, as seen in Map C.
These "considerations" are offered in hopes of drawing attention to basic open space design issues that must be addressed in our region. The accompanying illustrations are provided only to reduce the abstract quality of the text and to stimulate the imagination. The tract depicted does
BASIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR OPEN SPACE DESIGN GUIDELINES
1.
Set aside ridgelines, steep slopes, flood prone areas, wetlands, significant natural features, and historic and archaeological resources as a core for open space. Take care to ensure that the resulting configuration is coherent and reasonably contiguous. Whenever possible, arrange open space to abut existing or potential open space on adjoining properties. Map D displays topographical features that should be conserved, while Map E shows cultural, historic, and archaeological resources.
2.
Site buildings in harmony with landforms. Locate new buildings and structures where neither construction nor access causes substantial alteration to topography or natural resources.
3.
Take advantage of existing topography to preserve the lay of the land. Fit buildings and other amenities in to the site. Use slopes advantageously to accommodate multilevel structures with entrances on more than one level (e.g. walk out basements, garages under houses). Reserve flatter areas for septic fields and parking. Use natural landforms to screen structures from public roads. Map F illustrates how a natural feature such as a hill can protect a viewshed by screening new construction from view of a country road.
4.
Do not make large cuts in hillsides or grade large areas flat. Both practices can cause erosion and disrupt natural drainage patterns in addition to being ugly. Site buildings to avoid substantial modification to natural landforms.
5.
Situate new construction to minimize disruption of traditional viewsheds. Loss of traditional viewscapes results in erosion of local sense of place. Progressive destruction of community character will result in the loss of any sense that one place is distinct from another place.
6.
Set buildings back into or against tree lines to lessen the impact to the viewshed. New construction isolated in a field can destroy traditional atmosphere. Tree lines and other vegetative backdrops have a certain ability to absorb disruptive impacts on the landscape. Map G shows some house sites set back into the woods to prevent their intrusion into the viewshed.
7.
Do not site buildings in open fields. If greater constraints apply to the rest of the parcel, locate buildings at the farthest edges of the fields, as seen from public roads. Map H shows two illustrations of this principle.
8.
Take advantage of open fields as sites for septic tanks and fields. These uses are non-disruptive of traditional appearance.
9.
Maintain existing tree lines and field edges, including irregular configurations. These features define outdoor space in traditional ways, and add variety and interest to viewsheds. Map I points out the kind of edges that should be conserved.
10.
Use existing vegetation and topography to buffer and screen new construction from public roads. Viewsheds are protected, and housing is shielded from read noise and the gaze of the curious.
11.
Plant traditional species and maintain traditional planting patterns. Communities that have developed over time generally have established planting practices. Ensure that new species harmonize with existing vegetation. Map J shows how new plantings of traditional species can lessen the impact of development on a viewshed by screening new construction from a country road.
12.
Use existing roads whenever possible to minimize clearing and landscape destruction. Map K points out old alignments that can serve new development.
13.
Widen existing roads as little as possible to take advantage of existing vegetation as a buffer. In addition, conventional wide, clear cut rights of way translate as super highway as opposed to rural.
14.
Construct new roads as narrow as possible to maintain a rural atmosphere and avoid a discordant expressway atmosphere.
15.
Do not run roads through the middle of open fields. Lessen the impact of a new road on a viewshed by placing it along tree lines or other landscape boundaries. Map L shows some applications of this principle.

Sec. 30-113. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The city may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 30-114(b)(2);
(15)
Except as provided in subsection (c)(16), there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1, et seq. shall prevent the city from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 30-114(b) and (c).
(e)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
( Ord. No. 14-01, § 1, 12-15-2014 )
Sec. 30-114. - Application/permit process.
(a)
General. The property owner, developer, and designated planners and engineers are encouraged to review all city development standards including, but not limited to, the zoning ordinance, the storm water management ordinance, the subdivision ordinance, the flood hazard mitigation ordinance, this article, and any other laws, rules, regulations, or permits which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. As required by EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10, the design professional shall make a site visit before submitting the general development plans.
(b)
Application and permits. Inasmuch as the city has elected not to become certified as a local issuing authority for land disturbance permits, the terms of the general state permit for construction activities shall apply, as administered and enforced by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, and no individual land-disturbing activity permit shall be required; provided, however, that notice of intent (NOI) shall be submitted to EPD prior to commencement of any land-disturbing activities within the city, and a copy of the NOI shall simultaneously be filed with the city manager or his designee.
( Ord. No. 14-01, § 1, 12-15-2014 )
Sec. 30-115. - Inspection and enforcement.
(a)
In addition to inspection and enforcement by EPD under the general permit for construction activities, the city manager or his designee may periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with approved plans and if the measures required in the erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.
(b)
The city shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
(c)
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the city, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
( Ord. No. 14-01, § 1, 12-15-2014 )
Sec. 30-116. - Penalties and incentives.
(a)
Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity within the city without first complying with the state general permit, the person shall be immediately reported by the city manager to EPD and subject to suspension or revocation of any permit or other authorization issued by the city for the conduct of associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city.
(b)
Stop-work orders.
(1)
For the first and second violation of the provisions of this article, the city shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the city manager, in consultation with the division shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without first obtaining the necessary permit, the city manager shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning;
(2)
For a third and each subsequent violation, the city manager shall issue an immediate stop-work order and notify the director of EPD; and
(3)
All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred.
(4)
When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.
(c)
Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one. The director may call the bond, or any part thereof, to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
(d)
Monetary penalties.
(1)
Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article or O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 7, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided by law shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalties not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.
( Ord. No. 14-01, § 1, 12-15-2014 )
Sec. 30-117. - Administrative appeal.
The suspension, revocation, or modification of any permit issued by the city upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan; that the holder is in violation of state general permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any law, rule or regulation pertaining to land disturbance within the city; shall entitle the aggrieved person to a hearing before the mayor and council within 30 days after receipt by the city manager of a written notice of appeal. The appellant shall have the burden on appeal to show cause why the permit(s) should be reinstated in order to allow development to continue. The decision of the mayor and council shall be deemed final. Any person aggrieved by a final decision of the mayor and council shall have 30 days in which to file a petition for certiorari in the superior court of the county.
( Ord. No. 14-01, § 1, 12-15-2014 )
