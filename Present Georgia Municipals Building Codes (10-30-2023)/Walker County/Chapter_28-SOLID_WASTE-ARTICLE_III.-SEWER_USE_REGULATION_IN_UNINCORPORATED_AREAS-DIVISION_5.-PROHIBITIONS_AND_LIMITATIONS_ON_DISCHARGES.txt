DIVISION 5. - PROHIBITIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON DISCHARGES

Sec. 28-178. - Purpose and policy.
This section establishes limitations and prohibitions on the quantity and quality of wastewater which may be legally discharged into the POTW. Pretreatment of some wastewater discharges will be required to achieve the goals established by this division and the Clean Water Act. The specific limitations set forth in section 28-188, and other prohibitions and limitations of this division, are subject to change as necessary to enable the Authority to provide efficient wastewater treatment, to protect the public health and environment, and to enable the Authority to meet requirements contained in its NPDES permit. The Authority shall review said limitations from time to time to ensure that they are sufficient to protect the health and safety of sewer system personnel and the operation of the treatment works, to enable the facility to comply with its NPDES permit, to provide for a cost-effective means of operating the treatment works, and to protect the public health and the environment. The Authority shall recommend changes or modifications, as necessary.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-1)
Sec. 28-179. - Prohibited pollutants.
No person shall introduce into the POTW any pollutant which cause pass-through or interference. Additionally, the following specific prohibitions apply:
(1)
Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, pollutants with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Centigrade), as determined by a Pensky-Martens closed-cup tester, using the test method specified in the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D-93-79 or D-93-80k, or a Setaflash closed-cup tester, using the test method specified in ASTM D-3278-78, or pollutants which cause an exceedance of 10 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) at any point within the POTW.
(2)
Pollutants which cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW, but in no case discharges with a pH lower than 5.5 or higher than 10.0, except as provided in section 28-187.
(3)
Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts which cause obstruction to the flow of the sewers or other interference with the operation of or which cause injury to the POTW, including waxy or other materials which tend to coat and clog a sewer line or other appurtenances thereto.
(4)
Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released in a discharge (slug) of such volume or strength as to cause interference in the POTW or individual unit operations or cause adverse effects on its workers or the environment.
(5)
Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at the treatment works influent exceeds 40 degrees Centigrade (104 degrees Fahrenheit). Unless a higher temperature is allowed in the user's wastewater discharge permit, no user shall discharge into any sewer line or other appurtenance of the POTW wastewater with a temperature exceeding 63.5 degrees Centigrade (150 degrees Fahrenheit).
(6)
Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker's health and safety problems.
(7)
Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the POTW.
(8)
Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that cause interference or pass-through.
(9)
Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance, a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
(10)
Any wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating the Authority's NPDES permit.
(11)
Any sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes.
(12)
Any wastewater causing the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test.
(13)
Any wastes containing detergents, surface active agents, or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-2)
Sec. 28-180. - Affirmative defenses.
(a)
Upset.
(1)
For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(2)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(3) of this section are met.
(3)
An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
a.
An upset occurred, and the industrial user can identify the cause of the upset.
b.
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures.
c.
The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within 5 days):
1.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance.
2.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue.
3.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4)
In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5)
Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(6)
The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(b)
An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in division 5 of this article if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either:
(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or
(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the Authority was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-3)
Sec. 28-181. - Wastewater constituent evaluation.
(a)
The wastewater of every industrial user shall be evaluated using the following criteria:
(1)
Wastewater containing any element or compound which is known to be an environmental hazard, and which is not adequately removed by the treatment works.
(2)
Wastewater causing a pass-through, discoloration, foam, floating oil and grease, or any other condition in the quality of the Authority's treatment work effluent such that receiving water quality requirements established by law cannot be met.
(3)
Wastewater causing conditions at or near the Authority's treatment works which violate any statute, rule, or regulation of any public agency of Georgia or the United States.
(4)
Wastewater containing any element or compound known to act as a lacrimator, known to cause nausea, or known to cause odors constituting a public nuisance.
(5)
Wastewater causing interference with the effluent or any other product of the treatment process, residues, sludges, or scums causing them to be unsuitable for reclamation, reuse, causing interference with the reclamation process, or causing them to be unsuitable for disposal.
(6)
Wastewater discharged at a point in the collection system that is upstream of any overflow, bypass, or combined sewer overflow and which may thereby cause special environmental problems or specific discharge limitations.
(7)
Wastewater having constituents and concentrations in excess of those listed in section 28-188 or cause a violation of the limits in section 28-189.
(8)
The capacity of existing sewer lines to carry the anticipated wastewater flow, particularly with respect to any problems, overflows, or overloads caused by heavy rain infiltration.
(b)
The Authority shall establish reasonable limitations, prohibitions, or monitoring requirements in addition to the limits established pursuant to sections 28-179 and section 28-188 in the wastewater discharge permit of any industrial user that discharges wastewater violating any of the above criteria or that has processes that generate wastewater that could violate any of the above criteria prior to pretreatment as shall be reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose and policy of this division.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-4)
Sec. 28-182. - National pretreatment standards.
(a)
Certain industrial users are now or hereafter shall become subject to national pretreatment standards promulgated by the EPA specifying quantities or concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be discharged into the POTW. All industrial users subject to such a standard shall comply with all requirements and with any additional or more stringent limitations contained in this division. Compliance with national pretreatment standards for existing sources subject to such standards or for existing sources which hereafter become subject to such standards shall be achieved within 3 years following promulgation of the standards unless a shorter compliance time is specified. Compliance for new sources shall be required upon promulgation. New sources shall have in operating condition and shall start up all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards.
(b)
The industrial user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from EPA. Such a request will be approved only if the industrial user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard. An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-5)
Sec. 28-183. - Dilution.
Except where expressly authorized by an applicable national pretreatment standard, no industrial user shall increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitution for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with such standard. The Authority may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-6)
Sec. 28-184. - Limitation on radioactive waste.
No person shall discharge or permit to be discharged any radioactive waste into a community sewer, except as follows:
(1)
When the person is authorized to use radioactive materials by the EPD or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
(2)
When the waste is discharged in strict conformity with applicable laws and regulations of the agencies having jurisdiction.
(3)
When a copy of permits received from said regulatory agencies has been filed with the Authority.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-7)
Sec. 28-185. - Limitation on pH excursions.
(a)
Where an industrial user continuously measures wastewater pH, the user shall maintain the pH of such wastewater within the range set forth in this sewer use article, except excursions from the range are permitted subject to the following limitations:
(1)
The total time during which the pH values are outside the required range of pH values shall not exceed 7 hours and 26 minutes in any calendar month.
(2)
No individual excursion from the range of pH values shall exceed 60 minutes duration.
(3)
No individual excursion shall fall below a pH of 5.0.
(b)
An excursion is an unintentional and temporary incident in which the pH value of discharge wastewater falls outside the range of pH values set forth by this article. This provision for temporary pH excursions shall only apply to permitted industrial users in the Chickamauga Sewer Service Area.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-8)
Sec. 28-186. - Septic tank pumping, hauling, and discharge.
No person shall discharge septage from vacuum or cesspool pump trucks or other liquid waste transport trucks directly or indirectly into the POTW, unless that person first receives from the Authority a septic tank discharge permit. All applicants for a septic tank discharge permit shall complete the forms required by the Authority, pay appropriate fees, and agree in writing to abide by the provisions of this division and any special conditions or regulations established by the Authority.
(1)
Septic tank discharge permits are not automatically renewed and are valid only on the day of issuance. Application for renewal must be made to the Authority for each discharge.
(2)
Persons shall be subject to debarment from further permits by the Authority for violation of any provisions of this Code, regulations as established by the Authority, or other applicable laws and regulations. Such debarment shall be for a period not to exceed 3 years and shall bind the permittee, any member of the immediate family of the permittee, or any person who has purchased the business or a substantial amount of the assets of the permittee who paid less than fair market value for such business or assets. Users found operating in violation of a permit issued under this subsection and who are debarred from further permits by the Authority shall be notified of the violation by certified mail or by a notice personally delivered to the user.
(3)
Such permits shall be limited to the discharge of domestic sewage waste containing no industrial waste and no grease trap pumpage. All other hauled wastes shall be governed by section 28-187. Any user transporting, collecting, or discharging nondomestic industrial process wastewaters or a mixture of such wastewaters with domestic wastewater shall obtain a holding tank discharge permit in accordance with section 28-187.
(4)
The Authority shall designate the locations and times where such trucks may be discharged and may refuse to accept any truckload of waste at its absolute discretion where it appears that the waste could interfere with the effective operation of the treatment works or any sewer line or appurtenance thereto, or where it appears that a truckload of waste contains industrial process waste or a mixture of domestic sewage and industrial process waste.
(5)
The Authority shall have authority to investigate the source of any hauled waste and to require testing of the waste at the expense of the discharger prior to discharge.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-9)
Sec. 28-187. - Other holding tank waste.
No user shall discharge any other holding tank wastes, including hauled industrial waste, into the POTW unless he has been issued a holding tank discharge permit by the Authority. Unless otherwise allowed under the terms and conditions of the permit, a separate permit must be secured for each separate discharge. All applicants for a holding tank discharge permit shall complete forms required by the Authority, pay appropriate fees, and agree in writing to abide by the provisions of this division and any special conditions or regulations established by the Authority. All such dischargers and transporters must show that they have complied with Federal manifests and other regulations under RCRA. The permit shall state the specific location of the discharge, the time of day the discharge is to occur, the volume of the discharge, and the source and character of the waste, and shall limit the wastewater constituents and characteristics of the discharge. The user shall pay any applicable charges or fees and shall comply with the conditions of the permit. However, the Authority may waive at its discretion the application and the fees for discharge of domestic waste from a recreational vehicle holding tank.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-10)
Sec. 28-188. - Limitations on wastewater strength (local limits).
(a)
No user shall discharge wastewater with pollutant concentrations in excess of the concentration set forth in tables 28-189.1, 2, or 3 (as applicable) unless:
(1)
An exception has been granted the user under the provisions of section 28-229; or
(2)
The user's wastewater discharge permit provides a special permit condition temporarily allowing a higher interim concentration level in conjunction with a requirement that the user construct a pretreatment facility or institute changes in operation and maintenance procedures to reduce the concentration of pollutants to levels not exceeding the standards set forth in the table within a fixed period of time.
(b)
Concentrations apply at the point where the industrial waste is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. At his discretion, the Authority Manager may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration-based limitations above.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-11)
Sec. 28-189. - Criteria to protect the treatment plant influent.
The Authority shall monitor the treatment works influent for the Chickamauga Sewer Service Area for each pollutant in table 22-189.4. Industrial users shall be subject to the reporting and monitoring requirements set forth in division 5 of this article as to these pollutants. In the event that the influent at the treatment works reaches or exceeds the established levels, the Authority shall initiate technical studies to determine the cause of the influent violation and shall recommend remedial measures as necessary, including, but not limited to, the establishment of new or revised pretreatment levels for these pollutants. The Authority shall also recommend changes to any of these criteria in the event the POTW effluent standards or applicable laws or regulations are changed, or when changes are necessary for a more effective operation.

Sec. 28-190. - Storm drainage, groundwater, unpolluted water, and contaminated stormwater.
(a)
No stormwater, groundwater, rainwater, street drainage, rooftop drainage, basement drainage, subsurface drainage, foundation drainage, yard drainage, swimming pool drainage, process water drainage, cooling water, or other unpolluted or minimally polluted water shall be discharged into the Authority's sewer unless no other reasonable alternative is available, except with permission from the Authority. Reasonable conditions shall be prescribed, and a sewer service charge will be issued based upon the quantity of water discharged as measured by a flowmeter or a reasonable estimate accepted by the Authority. All users shall be required to maintain their private sewer lines so as to prevent infiltration of ground or stormwater as a condition of use of the system and shall immediately repair or replace any leaking or damaged lines.
(b)
The Authority will accept the discharge of contaminated stormwater if the following criteria are met:
(1)
All known and available technology will not prevent contamination or treat contaminated water to meet State standards for discharge to receiving waters or will cause unreasonable financial burden;
(2)
The contaminated stormwater meets the Authority's discharge limits and all State and Federal pretreatment requirements; and
(3)
The volume of the discharge will not exceed the hydraulic loading in the collection system or the treatment plant.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-13)
Sec. 28-191. - Limitations on the use of garbage grinders.
No waste from commercial or institutional garbage grinders shall be discharged into the Authority's sewers except from private garbage grinders used in an individual residence or upon approval of the Authority for preparation of food consumed on premises, and then only where applicable fees are paid. Installation of any garbage grinder equipped with a ¾ horsepower (or greater) motor shall require approval. The Authority may grant approval when there is inadequate space on the user's premises to properly store food preparation waste between regularly scheduled garbage pickup, by a service with an equal or greater frequency of collection; provided, further, that such grinders shall shred the waste sufficiently that it can be carried freely under normal flow conditions prevailing in the Authority's sewer lines. It shall be unlawful for any person to use a garbage grinder connected to the sewer system for the purpose of grinding and discharging plastic, paper products, inert materials, or anything other than the waste products from normal food preparation and consumption.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-14)
Sec. 28-192. - Hospital or medical waste.
It shall be unlawful for any person to dispose of medical waste, surgical operating room waste, or delivery room waste into the Authority's sewer.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-15)
Sec. 28-193. - Obstruction of or damage to sewer lines.
It shall be unlawful for any person to deposit or cause to be deposited any waste which may obstruct or damage storm or sanitary sewer lines or which may inhibit, disrupt, or damage either system, including the sewer treatment process and operations. This prohibition includes all substances, whether liquid, solid, gaseous, or radioactive and whether associated with human habitation, of human or animal origin, or from any producing, manufacturing, or processing. It shall be unlawful to block or obstruct any catch basin, sewer line, or other appurtenance; or to break, injure, or remove any portion from any part of a sewer, drain, or catch basin, including plates covering manholes.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-16)
Sec. 28-194. - Tenant responsibility.
Where an owner of property leases premises to any other person as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if either the owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or both may be held responsible for compliance with the provisions of this division.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-17)
Sec. 28-195. - Mass and concentration limits.
(a)
When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for the purpose of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. In calculating equivalent mass per day limitations, the mass limits in the standard shall be multiplied by the user's average rate of production. The average rate of production shall not be based on the design production capacity, but rather upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user's actual long-term daily production. For new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected production. In calculating equivalent concentration limitations, the mass limits in the standard shall be divided by the average daily flow rate of the industrial user's regulated process wastewater. The average daily flow rate shall be based on a reasonable measure of the user's actual long-term average flow rate. Any day in which the facility does not have a discharge should not be included in the calculation of average flow.
(b)
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Authority shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with section 28-199.
(c)
Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with sections 28-196 through 28-199 are deemed pretreatment standards under Federal and State law. The Authority must document how the equivalent limits were derived from concentration to mass limits, or vice versa, and make this information available to the public. Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
(d)
Any industrial user operating under a control mechanism incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the Authority within 2 business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Authority of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its original control mechanism that were based on the original estimate of the long-term production rate.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-18)
Sec. 28-196. - Net/gross calculation.
Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the Authority. Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the following criteria are met:
(1)
Either:
a.
The applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they will be applied on a net basis; or
b.
The industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
(2)
Credit for generic pollutants such as BOD, TSS, and oil and grease will not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents measured in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents in the intake water, or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on the process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
(3)
Credit will be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards, up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section.
(4)
Credit will be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW discharges. The Authority may waive this requirement if he finds that no environmental degradation will result.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-19)
Sec. 28-197. - Equivalent mass units.
When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, the industrial user may request that the Superintendent convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration to mass limits is within the discretion of the Authority. The Authority may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the following conditions of subsection (1)a through e of this section:
(1)
To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must:
a.
Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its control mechanism;
b.
Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
c.
Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions;
d.
Not have any flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and
e.
Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits.
(2)
An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
a.
Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with equivalent mass limits;
b.
Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
c.
Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the Authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from the baseline production rates determined in subsection (1)c of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Authority must reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
d.
Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection (1)a of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
(3)
If the Authority chooses to establish equivalent mass limits, it:
a.
Must calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average limits of the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor;
b.
Upon notification of a revised production rate, must reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
c.
May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent control mechanism terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based upon the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment. The user must also be in compliance with section 28-227 regarding prohibition of bypasses.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-20)
Sec. 28-198. - Equivalent concentration limits.
The Authority may convert the mass limits of categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Authority. When converting such limits to concentration limits, the Authority may use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 CFR 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by section 28-183.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 6-21)
Sec. 28-199. - Combined waste stream formula.
Where process effluent is mixed prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived by the Authority, or by the industrial user with the consent of the Authority. The alternative limits shall be applied to the mixed effluent. When deriving alternative categorical limits, the Authority or industrial user shall calculate both an alternative daily maximum value using the maximum value specified in the appropriate categorical pretreatment standard and an alternative consecutive sampling day average value using the monthly average value specified in the appropriate categorical pretreatment standard. The industrial user shall comply with the alternative daily maximum and monthly average limits fixed by the Authority until the Authority modifies the limits or approves an industrial user's modification request. Modification is authorized whenever there is a material or significant change in the values used in the calculation to fix alternative limits for the regulated pollutant. An industrial user must immediately report any such material or significant change to the Authority.
(1)
Alternative limit calculation. Alternative limits shall be calculated using the formula and instructions in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(2)
Alternative limits below detection limit. An alternative pretreatment limit may not be used if the alternative limit is below the analytical detection limit of any regulated pollutants.
(3)
Choice of monitoring location. Where a regulated process waste stream is combined prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process, the industrial user may monitor either the segregated process waste stream or the combined waste stream for the purpose of determining compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards. If the industrial user chooses to monitor the segregated process waste stream, it shall apply the applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If the user chooses to monitor the combined waste stream, it shall apply the alternative discharge limit calculated using the combined waste stream formula as described in this section. The industrial user may change monitoring locations only after receiving prior approval from the Authority. The industrial user may not use dilution as a substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with applicable standards.
