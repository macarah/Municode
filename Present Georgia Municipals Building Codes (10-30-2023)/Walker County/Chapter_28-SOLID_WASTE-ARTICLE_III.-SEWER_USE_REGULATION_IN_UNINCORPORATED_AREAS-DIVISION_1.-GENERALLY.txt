DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 28-58. - Purpose and policy.
The purpose of this article is to set uniform requirements for users of the Authority's wastewater collection system and treatment works to enable the Authority to comply with the provisions of the Clean Water Act and other applicable Federal and State law and regulations, and to provide for the public health and welfare by regulating the quality of wastewater discharged into the Authority's wastewater collection system and treatment works. This article establishes conditions for connection to the sanitary sewer system and requires a permit. Certain acts which may be detrimental to the sewer system are prohibited. This article provides a means for determining wastewater volumes, constituents, and characteristics; the setting of charges and fees; and the issuance of permits to certain users. This article establishes effluent limitations and other discharge criteria and provides that certain users shall pretreat waste to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) which may interfere with the operation of the POTW, cause environmental damage, or interfere with the use or disposal of sewage sludge. Pretreatment may also be required to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the treatment works into the receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the treatment works and to improve the opportunities to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and the sludges resulting from wastewater treatment. This article provides measures for the enforcement of its provisions and abatement of violations thereof.

New source means:
(1)
Any building, structure, facility, or installation from which there is or may be a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which commenced after the publication of proposed pretreatment standards under section 307(c) of the. Act which will be applicable to such source if such standards are thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section, provided that 1 of the following criteria is applicable:
a.
The building, structure, facility, or installation is constructed at a site at which no other source is located.
b.
The building, structure, facility, or installation totally replaces the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at an existing source.
c.
The production or wastewater-generating processes of the building, structure, facility, or installation are substantially independent of an existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant and the extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source should be considered.
(2)
Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the criteria of subsection (1)b or c of this definition but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to existing process or production equipment.

Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or modified without substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering, and design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation under this subsection.

Pass-through means a discharge which exits the POTW into waters of the United States in the quantities or concentrations which, alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources, is a cause of a violation of any requirement of the POTW's NPDES permit (including an increase in the magnitude or duration of a violation). In the case of a POTW receiving discharges from CWTs as defined above, the term "pass-through" also means the failure of the CWT and the POTW to reduce pollutant discharges from the POTW to the degree required under section 301(b)(2) of the CWA if the CWT discharged directly to surface waters.

The reduction or alteration may be obtained by physical, chemical, or biological processes; process changes or by other means, except as prohibited by 40 CFR 403.6(d). Appropriate pretreatment technology includes control equipment, such as equalization tanks or facilities, for protection against surges or slug loadings that might interfere with or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW. However, where wastewater from a regulated process is mixed in an equalization facility with unregulated wastewater or with wastewater from another regulated process, the effluent from the equalization facility must meet an adjusted pretreatment limit calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
Pretreatment requirements means any substantive or procedural requirement related to pretreatment other than a national pretreatment standard imposed on an industrial user.
Pretreatment standards means prohibited discharge standards, categorical pretreatment standards, or local limits.
Publicly owned treatment works (POTW) means a treatment works as defined by section 212 of the Act (33 USC 1292). The term "publicly owned treatment works" includes any sewers that convey wastewater to such a treatment works and any devices and systems used in the storage, treatment, recycling, and reclamation of municipal sewage or liquid industrial waste, but does not include pipes, sewers, or other conveyances not connected to a facility providing treatment.

(3)
All non-categorical dischargers that, in the opinion of the Authority, have a reasonable potential to adversely affect the POTW's operation or violate any pretreatment standard or requirement. This shall include, but shall not be limited to, all centralized waste treatment discharges, all tank and drum cleaning facilities, and all paint manufacturing facilities.
(4)
All non-categorical discharges that contain more than 100 pounds per day of combined BOD and TSS load above that level found in normal wastewater, or that contain more than 1,000 pounds in a month of combined BOD and TSS load above that level found in normal wastewater.
(5)
Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in subsections (2) and (3) of this definition has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement, the Authority may at any time on its own initiative or in response to a petition received from an industrial user, and in accordance with procedures in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6), determine that such user should not be considered a significant industrial user.

(3)
Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (instantaneous, daily maximum or longer-term average, or narrative standard) that the Authority determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through (including endangering the health of Authority personnel or the general public).
