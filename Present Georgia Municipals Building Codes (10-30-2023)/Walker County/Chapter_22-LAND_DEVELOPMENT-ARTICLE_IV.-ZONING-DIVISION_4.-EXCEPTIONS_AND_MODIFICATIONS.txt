DIVISION 4. - EXCEPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS

Sec. 22-223. - Lots of record.
(a)
Single lots. Where the owner of a lot at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived or his successor in title thereto does not own sufficient land to enable him to conform to the dimensional requirements of this article, such lot may be used as a building site for a single-family residence in a district where residences are permitted, provided that the development of the lot is in compliance with the subdivision regulations and restrictions applicable thereto.
(b)
Adjoining lots. If 2 or more adjoining lots with continuous frontage are in a single ownership at any time after the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived and such lots individually are too small to meet the requirements of the district in which they are located, such groups of lots shall be considered as a single lot or several lots of minimum permitted size and the lot in 1 ownership shall be subject to the requirements of this article.
(Code 2005, § 34-291; Ord. of 7-20-1994, § 5.00)
Sec. 22-224. - Height limitation exceptions.
The height limitations of this article shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes not intended for human occupancy, monuments, water towers, observation towers, transmission towers, chimneys, smokestacks, conveyors, flag poles, radio towers, television towers, masts, aerials, and similar structures.
(Code 2005, § 34-292; Ord. of 7-20-1994, § 5.01)
Sec. 22-225. - Temporary placement of manufactured homes—Permit.
(a)
The owner of a lot upon which a residential dwelling is being constructed may, upon first obtaining a temporary permit from the Planning Director, temporarily place a manufactured home on said lot for use as a temporary dwelling for a period of 6 months or until construction of the dwelling is completed, whichever shall first occur. The temporary permit may be renewed for 1 additional period of 6 months, subject to skirting, underpinning and tiedown requirements of this article, unless an extension is granted by the Planning Commission for good cause shown.
(b)
The application for a temporary permit shall have attached thereto a separate statement of the applicant that he acknowledges and agrees that the permit, if granted, is valid only for the time specified and that, upon completion of the dwelling or the expiration of the permit, as the case may be, he shall cause the removal of said manufactured home and his failure to do so grants to the County the right to remove the same from the lot at the applicant's expense.
(Code 2005, § 34-293; Ord. of 7-20-1994, § 5.02)
Sec. 22-226. - Temporary placement of manufactured homes—Residential zones.
(a)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this article, a manufactured home may be temporarily placed in residential zones established by this article, upon the following conditions:
(1)
An application for a temporary permit is accompanied by an affidavit from a health care official unrelated to the applicant certifying that an exemption and temporary permit is appropriate.
(2)
The temporary permit is needed for the health care of a member of the applicant's immediate family.
(3)
The application for the temporary permit has attached thereto a separate statement of the applicant that he acknowledges and agrees that the permit is valid only for as long as the conditions of the permit are met, and that, upon the termination of any of the conditions, the applicant shall cause the removal of the manufactured home at his own expense and his failure to do so grants to the County the right to remove the same from the premises at the applicant's expense.
(b)
The temporary permit shall be valid as long as all of the conditions referred to in subsection (a) of this section continue to be met; provided, however, that the applicant shall renew the same annually by certifying to the Planning Director that each of the conditions continue to exist.
(Code 2005, § 34-294; Ord. of 7-20-1994, § 5.03)
Sec. 22-227. - Continuation of non-conforming uses.
(a)
The lawful use of any building, structure or land existing at the time of the enactment of or subsequent amendment to the ordinance from which this section is derived may be continued subject to the restrictions contained in this article, even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this article, except that:
(1)
A non-conforming use or structure shall not be changed to another non-conforming use;
(2)
A non-conforming use or structure shall not be extended or enlarged, except in conformity with this article; or
(3)
A non-conforming use of a structure shall not be reestablished after discontinuance by abandonment of such use for 1 year.
(b)
The lawful use (i.e., a use which complies with all Federal, State and County laws, ordinances, regulations and statutes as interpreted by the appellate courts) of any building, structure or land existing at the time of the enactment of the ordinance from which this section is derived may be continued, subject to the restrictions contained in this article, even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this article, provided that:
(1)
A non-conforming use or structure shall not be changed to another non-conforming use; provided, however, that a structure that is being leased which loses its tenant may alter that use to a use that is allowed under the same zoning classification as the previous tenant had used it (e.g., a building that is being leased for an industrial use may continue to lease to an industrial tenant), subject to the buffer/screening requirements that may be required in section 22-184.
(2)
A non-conforming use shall be allowed to continue within the confines of any structure in which it may be operating. That is, the use may continue and the volume or intensity of such non-conforming use or activity may increase within the confines of the structure wherein such non-conforming activity is occurring at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived. Additionally, the size of the structure housing such non-conforming use may be enlarged no more than 25 percent of its size (in terms of square feet of floor area) as long as the enlargement does not create new non-conformities (or increase the extent of an existing non-conformity) with respect to setback or buffer requirements. However, a non-conforming use outside of the confines of any structure shall not be extended or enlarged to increase areas of land used for the non-conforming use beyond the area actually occupied by improvements utilizing such use at the time of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived.
(3)
The erection of a new building or structure for utilization of the non-conforming use, by replacement; provided, however, a temporary non-conforming structure (i.e., a manufactured home/mobile home that has been utilized in the operation of the non-conforming use) in existence on the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived may be replaced by a permanent structure upon obtaining a variance for good cause shown (e.g., replacement of a manufactured home with a house).
(c)
Notwithstanding any provision of this article that may be to the contrary, a non-conforming use or structure that is destroyed by fire or other natural disaster may be rebuilt, altered or repaired only as provided herein:
(1)
If the structure is altered or repaired, said alterations or repairs shall be in conformity with the building codes in force at the time of said alteration or repair; provided, however, that said alteration or repair shall not extend or enlarge the structure being altered or repaired by no more than 25 percent, but must meet all setback requirements;
(2)
If the structure is totally rebuilt, the replacement structure shall conform with all the requirements of this article, except as to the district; however, it may be rebuilt on the original footprint.
(d)
Existing industries at the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived are exempt.
(Code 2005, § 34-295; Ord. of 7-20-1994, § 5.04; Ord. of 1-29-2009(1))
Sec. 22-228. - Grandfathered uses.
(a)
A grandfathered use cannot be moved from 1 non-conforming location to another non-conforming location.
(b)
Structures under physical construction on the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall be allowed to be completed regardless of whether the use to be made in such structure would be in a non-conforming zone. However, any applicable buffer and screening provisions shall apply to the structure and may be required unless it is completely constructed in its entirety and the intended use is ongoing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "physical construction" means the completion of the digging of and laying of the entire masonry or other foundation for a structure.
(c)
Once a building/development permit has been issued by the Planning and Enforcement Office, a landowner has a right to develop the property pursuant to that permit during the term of such permit as specified in this article (but not thereafter), notwithstanding a zoning change subsequent to the issuance of the building/development permit.
(d)
Once a special use permit has been issued by the zoning entity, a landowner has a right to develop the property pursuant to that permit during the term of such permit as specified in this article (but not thereafter), notwithstanding a zoning change subsequent to the issuance of the building/development permit.
(e)
Where a landowner makes a substantial change in position by expenditures in reasonable reliance upon the existing ordinance and upon the written assurance of zoning officials (having the authority to make such assurance) that a building/development permit will probably be issued, such landowner acquires vested rights and is entitled to have the permit issued despite a change in the article which would otherwise preclude the issuance of such permit; provided, however, that neither the purchase of property for the purpose of a potential development site, nor the incurring of sums for site preparation and/or partial foundation construction (which are deemed insubstantial expenditures in terms of the interpretation of this article) shall constitute substantial expenditures entitling the landowner/occupier to any vested or grandfathered right to a particular use or to the unrestricted use of his property so purchased or partially developed, unless such property owner purchased the property or began construction after receiving a specific written assurance from such zoning official that the use would positively or probably be allowed for a specific length of time under this article.
(Code 2005, § 34-296; Ord. of 7-20-1994, § 5.05)

Residential, agricultural and planned unit development standards. Within all residential (R-1, R-2 and R-3), agricultural (A-1) or planned unit development (PUD) zones, such towers shall be set back at least the height of the tower, plus 10 feet from any single-family, duplex or multifamily dwelling located on the same lot or tract as the tower and the same distance (the height of the tower, plus 10 feet) from all lot lines for adjacent residential, agricultural or PUD zoned property not in the same ownership or not assembled for use as the tower site.
(c)
Power and structural integrity. Antennas and towers shall meet or exceed all Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and American National Standard Institute (ANSI)/Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards for power density levels and structural integrity, and it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to so certify in documents submitted in support of a permit. Preexisting installations shall comply whenever addition of a new or additional antenna or other modification necessitates a change in electrical service.
(d)
Permit applications. The following information shall be provided at the time of application for a permit:
(1)
A scaled site plan, a landscape plan and a scaled elevation view of the type of facility to be placed on the site. The site plan shall depict where the tower is to be located on the site and where additional collocated communication equipment, shelters or vaults can be placed.

(8)
Names, addresses and tax/parcel numbers of all property owners within 300 feet of the site existing at the time of application.
(9)
An erosion/sedimentation plan if anticipated earth disturbance equals or exceeds State requirements for such activity.
(e)
Collocation design. In addition to all applicable building and safety codes, all towers, except amateur radio towers, shall be designed to accommodate the collocation of other telecommunications antennas in accordance with the following:
(1)
For towers up to 150 feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least 2 providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology, whichever is greater;
(2)
For towers greater than 150 feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least 3 providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology, whichever is greater.
(f)
New towers. No new tower, except amateur radio towers, shall be permitted unless the applicant submits evidence to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the permitting office and the County Board of Commissioners that no existing tower or existing alterative tower structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna.
(g)
Aesthetics and landscaping. The guidelines set forth in this subsection shall govern the design and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennas governed by this section, and shall be approved by the Planning Director:
(1)
Towers and/or antennas shall either maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish or, subject to any applicable standard of the Federal Aviation Administration, be painted a neutral color to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2)
At all tower sites, the design of all buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and building environment. Any equipment or cabinet that supports telecommunication facilities must be concealed from public view and made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(3)
For antennas installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical ground equipment shall be of a neutral color to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive.
(4)
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the County Board of Commissioners may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. The lighting shall be dimmed or changed to red lights from sunset to sunrise.
(5)
No signage or other identifying markings of a commercial nature shall be permitted upon any tower or alterative tower structure within the County.
(6)
To the extent practical, towers or other telecommunication facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors designated by the County Board of Commissioners or by any State or Federal law or agency.
(7)
Access to the tower site shall be restricted to minimize visibility of the access. Where possible, existing roads shall be used. Where no roads exist, access shall follow the existing contours of the land.
(8)
Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screen the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of 10 feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound.
(9)
Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that which was lost.
(10)
Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the Planning Director to ensure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this section.
(11)
Such other additional requirements may be imposed, as the Planning Director shall reasonably require, to minimize the visual impact of the site on the surrounding area.
(h)
Amateur radios, receive-only antennas, emergency and government-related antennas and supporting towers. This section shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna that is under 150 feet in height and is owned and operated by a Federally licensed amateur radio station operator or is used for noncommercial receive-only antennas or is used for emergency or government-related communications. Any provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, all towers shall be constructed in substantial compliance with the manufacturer's recommendations and shall be no closer to adjacent residential structures than the height of the tower, plus 10 feet, but with structures located on the host property not considered for purposes of height and setback calculation, except that no such tower shall be located within a required front yard setback area.
(i)
Concealed antennas/locations on existing structures. An antenna may be permitted to be placed on or within an existing structure without additional restrictions. For purposes of this regulation, towers and antennas are permitted to be located on steeples, silos, spires, utility water tanks or towers, athletic field lighting poles, utility poles and similar structures. Towers, antennas and associated equipment which are totally concealed within a building or structure so that they are architecturally indiscernible shall not be considered towers or antennas for transmitting and receiving electronic signals and may be permitted in all zoning districts, subject to normal procedures for electrical connections.
(j)
Federal standards and regulations. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the Federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the permittee or the lessee of the tower and antenna governed by this section shall bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within 6 months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling Federal agency. Failure to bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall be deemed to be a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's, permittee's or lessee's expense.
(k)
Abandonment. The owner or lessee of a tower or antenna shall promptly notify the County Board of Commissioners of its intent to abandon or of the abandonment of any tower or antenna. Any tower or antenna that is not operated for a continuous period exceeding 12 months shall be considered abandoned and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove the structure within 90 days of such abandonment. If said tower or antenna is not removed within said 90 days, the County Board of Commissioners may take such action as may be deemed necessary to remove or cause to be removed such antenna or tower at the owner's expense.
(l)
Permit application procedures and fees. All applications for permits for the location and construction of towers, antennas and telecommunication facilities shall be submitted to the County Department of Planning and Development. The application shall be in a form and format to be determined by the Department, and necessary supporting information, including certifications by licensed engineers or other qualified technicians, may be required as needed to ensure that the proposed structure and use is in keeping with the terms and spirit of this section. Further, fees may be charged as needed to administer these regulations pursuant to a schedule to be determined and established separately by the County Board of Commissioners.
