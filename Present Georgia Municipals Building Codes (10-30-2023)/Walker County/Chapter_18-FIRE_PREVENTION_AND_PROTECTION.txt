Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to regulate responsibilities of those persons who purchase, rent, or use alarm systems, devices, or services.

This section specifically encompasses fire alarms, burglar alarms, robbery alarms, hold-up alarms, medical alarms, and panic alarms, both audible and inaudible (silent). The provisions of this section shall not apply to alarm systems which are owned or maintained by Walker County, with exception of those alarms which are installed by a tenant on premises in which the County merely has a property interest as a landlord.

(2)
By a private alarm service company relayed to the County Communications Center telephone;
(3)
By an automated telephone alarm system, playing a recorded message when received on the County Communications Center telephone; or
(4)
