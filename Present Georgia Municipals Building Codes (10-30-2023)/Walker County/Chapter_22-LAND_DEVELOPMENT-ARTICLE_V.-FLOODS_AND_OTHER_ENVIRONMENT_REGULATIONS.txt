Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives.
(1)
Authorization. Article IX, section II of the Georgia Constitution and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Governing Authority of Walker County, Georgia, does ordain as follows:
(2)
Findings of fact.
a.
The flood hazard areas of Walker County, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
b.
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(3)
Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
a.
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
b.
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
c.
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
d.
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
e.
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(4)
Objectives. The objectives of this section are to:
a.
Protect human life and health;
b.
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
c.
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
d.
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
e.
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
f.
Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
g.
Ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

(iii)
Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (d)(2)c of this section.
d.
Floodway. Located within Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in subsection (b)(2) of this section are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
1.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
2.
Only if subsection (d)(2)d.1 of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this subsection (d).
(3)
Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones). Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in subsection (b)(2) of this section, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply:
a.
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with subsection (b)(2) of this section, then the Planning Director shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this subsection (d). Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions in subsections (d)(3)b and c of this section shall apply:
b.
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a 1 foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
c.
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than 3 feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated 1 foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A zone areas where a Limited Detail Study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (d)(1)d of this section, elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than 3 feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. The Planning Director or his designee shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in subsection (b)(2) of this section may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of 1 foot to 3 feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply:
a.
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least 3 feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (d)(1)d of this section, elevated buildings. The Planning Director or his designee shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
b.
New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus 1 foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections (c)(2)a.3 and (c)(2)b of this section.
c.
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(5)
Standards for subdivisions.

Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) or Conditional Letter of Map Amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the as-built data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.
(6)
Standards for critical facilities.
a.
Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain.
b.
All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation.
(e)
Variance procedures.
(1)
The Planning Commission as established by Walker County shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this section.
(2)
The Board of Commissioners shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Planning Director in the enforcement or administration of this section.
(3)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Planning Commission may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Walker County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(4)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of Historic Structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an Historic Structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(5)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this subsection (e) are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(6)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(7)
In reviewing such requests, the Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other subsections of this section.
(8)
Conditions for variances.
a.
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
1.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
2.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
3.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
b.
The provisions of this section are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an Historic Structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
c.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
d.
The Planning Director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(9)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this section, the Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this section.

Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building.
Historic structure means any structure that is:
(1)
Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register:
(2)
Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district:

Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or
(4)
Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either:
a.
By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or
b.
Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code.
Manufactured home means a building, transportable in 1 or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property.
Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this definition, the term "mean sea level" is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD).
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the start of construction commenced on or after September 28, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure (i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for community participation in the NFIP).
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after September 28, 1979 (i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community).
North American Vertical Datum (NAVD), as corrected in 1988, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is:

(4)
Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on 2 separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damaged occurred.
Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be:
(1)
The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or
(2)
In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures, which have occurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include:
a.
Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or
b.
Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this section, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this section.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the Elevation Certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this section is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a building, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this section, shall be undertaken only if said non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
(b)
Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been provided, the following provisions are required:
(1)
Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than 1 foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards set forth in this section.
(2)
Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or non-residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than 1 foot above the level of the base flood elevation. Structures located in all A zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied.
(3)
Elevated buildings.
a.
New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
b.
Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect, or meet the following minimum criteria:
1.
Provide a minimum of 2 openings having a total net area of not less than 1 square inch for every foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
2.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above grade; and
3.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
c.
Electrical, plumbing and other utility connections are prohibited below the base flood elevation.
d.
Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
e.
The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
(4)
Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments shall be prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other land-disturbing activity, unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
b.
If the requirement of subsection (b)(4)a of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.
c.
The placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes) shall be prohibited, except in an existing manufactured home (mobile home) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the anchoring standards and elevation standards of this section are met.
(5)
Manufactured home and recreational vehicle standards.
a.
All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on individual lots or parcels, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions or in substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring.
b.
All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
1.
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than 1 foot above the level of the base flood elevation.
2.
The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
3.
The manufactured home must be securely anchored to the adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
c.
In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, any manufactured home placed or substantially improved must meet the standards of subsections (b)(5)b.1 and 3 of this section.
d.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
1.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use.
2.
Meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (b)(5)a or (b)(5)b.1 and 3 of this section.
e.
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it:
1.
Is on its wheels or jacking system;
2.
Is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices; and
3.
Has no permanently attached structures.
(c)
Standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection (b) of this section, where small streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where no floodways have been provided, the following provisions apply:
(1)
No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to 3 times the width of the stream at the top of the bank or 20 feet each side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2)
New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with this section.
(d)
Subdivision proposal standards.
(1)
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
(2)
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
(3)
All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
(4)
Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) which are greater than the lesser of 50 lots or 5 acres.
(e)
Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection (b) of this section are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least 2 feet above the highest adjacent grade.
(2)
All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall:
a.
Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least 2 feet above the highest adjacent grade; or
b.
Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
(Code 2005, § 34-437; Ord. of 7-20-1994, § 8.06)

(a)
The Planning Commission shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of these regulations.
(b)
The County Board of Commissioners shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, recommendation, or determination made by the Planning Commission in the enforcement or administration of the flood damage regulations.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the County or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the superior court, as provided by law.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section, and provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration will not result in the structure losing its historical designation.
(e)
In passing upon such applications, the Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this article, and:
(1)
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
(2)
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3)
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4)
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
(5)
The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility;
(6)
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
(7)
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(8)
The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
(9)
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(10)
The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
(11)
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges.
(f)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purpose of this article, the Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.
(g)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(h)
Conditions for variances include the following:
(1)
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief, and in the instance of an historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(2)
Variances shall only be issued upon:
a.
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height, additional threat to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, or create a nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The Planning Commission shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variance to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, upon request.
