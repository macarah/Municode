ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 26-1. - Regional transportation plan adopted.

(Code 1983, § 13-1; Code 2005, § 46-1)
Sec. 26-2. - Construction of roads for County maintenance.
(a)
Road construction specifications. The following specifications have been adopted by Walker County, Georgia, and will be required for the building of roads that are to be considered for placement on County maintenance.
(1)
Minimum pavement width. The minimum right-of-way will be 50 feet wide. The paved width shall be governed by the Walker County Planning Commission due to the 4 classes of road.
(2)
County-required inspections. Inspection by a County official shall be required during construction at every stage of construction, including, but not limited to, after the following: clearing, grubbing, the stripping of topsoil, subbase compaction, base layer, binder layer and topping layer. At each inspection, proper drainage, pipe size and class will be approved. Grading for the roadbed must be done by proper grading methods. During or upon completion of the roadway bed, on-site inspection will be required to determine if material is suitable for subbase. Should this subbase be in question, then the County Inspector will have the State Highway Department test the material. If the material is not approved, a minimum of one-foot of Class A or B chert shall be applied to the roadbed and rolled, or the subbase must pass a County-approved compaction test showing at least 95 percent compaction. The base material must be a minimum of 6-inch graded aggregate base (GAB) rolled meeting current minimum GDOT specifications. The base binder must be a minimum thickness of 2 inches when compacted. The topping must be a minimum of two-inches thickness when compacted. The Public Works Director or a designee will inspect each stage for compliance.
(3)
Paving methods. Paving may be done by 2 methods:
a.
Option number 1. Base to be primed with 0.30 gallons cutback asphalt primed per square yard and allowed to cure for sufficient time. A bituminous surface treatment consisting of 0.40 to 0.45 gallons asphalt per square yard with 50 pounds No. M-5 stone per square yard and sealed with bituminous seal consisting of .30 gallons of asphalt per square yard covered with 22 to 24 pounds of stone, size number 7. The additional paving to consist of 1½ inches of asphaltic concrete plant mix hot E topping, to meet the specifications of the Georgia Highway Department standards. (The developer may delay the finish topping until after the subdivision has been completed and heaving truck hauling into subdivision has been finished, provided a sufficient bond has been received by the Board of Commissioners, guarantee that the final paving will be done.)
b.
Option number 2. Base to be primed with 1/2.30 gallons cutback asphalt prime per square yard, allowed to cure sufficient time. A surface treatment of 2 inches of asphaltic concrete plant mix to meet the specifications of the Georgia Highway Department standards.
