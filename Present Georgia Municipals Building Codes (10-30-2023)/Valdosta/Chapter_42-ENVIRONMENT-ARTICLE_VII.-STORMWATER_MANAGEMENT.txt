ARTICLE VII. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

Sec. 42-401. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes, standards and criteria surrounding land development activities that protect public safety, infrastructure and the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources and the environment.
(2)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint source pollution, increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats.
(3)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality.
(4)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards.
(5)
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of green space and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include green space, with the city's green space protection plan.
(6)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety.
(7)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.
(b)
Applicability.

Sec. 42-403. - Stormwater management.
(a)
Stormwater management report requirements.
(1)
Every non-exempt project shall provide a stormwater management site plan prepared by a professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia. The purpose of this report shall be to formulate a plan to manage stormwater runoff so that stormwater runoff hazards are not created and existing runoff-related problems are not exacerbated, either upstream or downstream from or within the boundaries of the property being developed. The engineer shall be responsible for obtaining all information necessary for the report. Hydrologic analysis and detention pond hydraulics pipe and open channel hydraulics, culvert hydraulics and water quality best management practices shall be certified by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia. Flood studies for any floodplain or flood-prone areas, and hydrologic and hydraulic analysis and design calculations which are performed for the design of a dam shall be certified by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia. Projects that include the design of a dam or levee shall be certified by a professional engineer registered with the safe dam program from the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD).

The stormwater management site plan shall follow the technical guidance provided by the GSWMM, which provides details, examples and references to determine the following:
a.
Selection of hydrologic and hydraulic methods and models shall be made in accordance with the GSWMM Volume 2, Section 1.
b.
All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized based on all on-site upstream areas being developed per the development plans and the off-site upstream areas being fully developed with no detention. Upstream detention may be included when determining flows, provided the engineer calculates the reduced flows by routing the developed flows through any stormwater facility included in the analysis rather than assuming the reduction will occur. The engineer shall show that detention facilities used in the analysis will remain, be properly maintained and the storage volume and outlet structure is based on current conditions.
c.
Detention facilities shall be designed using pre-development flows based on existing conditions for all upstream areas including existing on-site lakes and detention. Post-development flows, except the 100-year flow, shall be based on on-site upstream areas being developed per the development plans and existing conditions for off-site upstream areas. The 100-year flow shall be based on on-site upstream areas being developed per the development plans and the off-site upstream areas being developed with no detention. Upstream detention may be included if it meets the conditions as described for culverts and pipe systems. Existing conditions shall be defined as the conditions of the site at the time of application for a land disturbance permit. The existing condition includes on-site lakes and ponds. Pre-development flows shall be determined by routing the pre-development flows through these stormwater facilities. Flows used to size the outlet structures for detention facilities that exceed the 25-year design flow, shall be sized as described for culverts and pipe systems.
d.
When more than 50 percent of the property of a developed project site is disturbed for either redevelopment or improvement, the stormwater management report shall be prepared for the entire site. When 50 percent or less of the property is disturbed, detention shall be provided as required by these regulations for the disturbed area and existing impervious areas which are disturbed.
e.
The report shall contain drainage area delineation maps and other exhibits at satisfactory scale and sufficient in quantity and scope to define the boundaries of the site and off-site areas relative to the watercourses, drainage divide, drainage structures and other pertinent features. The Southern Georgia Regional Commission (SGRC) VALOR GIS mapping shall be used where appropriate.
(3)
For the purposes of these regulations, the words "downstream" and "analysis" shall have the following meanings. The analysis of downstream conditions in the site plan shall address each and every point or area along the project site's boundaries at which runoff will exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion of the drainage way "immediately" downstream from the project. The city engineer provides guidance to applicants on how to apply the GSWMM criteria in the City of Valdosta, and the conditions requiring watershed evaluations beyond the site being developed. Hydrographs shall be analyzed as follows:
a.
The study will compare pre-developed hydrographs with post-developed hydrographs; and
b.
Comparison of peak flows shall include the timing of the hydrographs; and
c.
Hydrographs shall be based on a 24-hour storm.
(4)
The following elements shall be evaluated by the engineer preparing the stormwater management site plan and in determining whether or not detention should be required for any portion of a site:
a.
Existing land uses downstream;
b.
Anticipated future land uses downstream;
c.
Magnitude of increase in peak flows due to development;
d.
Presence of existing drainage problems;
e.
Capacity of existing and anticipated drainage systems;
f.
Creation of concentrated flows where none had occurred previously;
g.
Availability of feasible locations for detention facilities;
h.
Existing flows generated off-site which pass through the project site; and
i.
The nature of the receiving watercourse.
The city engineer provides additional guidance on the items above in the site development permit document.
(5)
Where detention for a proposed project is provided in a regional detention facility that was previously permitted, the developer shall provide a copy of the original study that met the regulations at the time the facility was permitted. If the approved study cannot be found, then the engineer shall. prepare a new site development study for the entire regional facility. The project shall be exempt from restudy and any modifications required to meet regulations, provided the proposed project is in keeping with the intent of the original detention study and the detention facility is maintained in agreement with the design and maintenance criteria set in subsections (f)(1)—(4) and (g)(1)—(7) of this section and sections 310.51(A)—(D) and 310-54(A) and (B) of the city's land development regulations.
(6)
When a development uses an existing facility where the last approved certification and record drawing of the facility was over 36 months prior to the new development's submittal, the engineer shall provide one of the following:
a.
A new survey, drawing and certification showing that the outlet structure is constructed as approved and the flood storage and water quality volume of the facility is equal to or greater than the volume required when the facility was approved.
b.
Construction plans and calculations showing that the outlet structure will function as designed and the flood storage and water quality volume of the facility will be equal to or greater than the volume required when the facility was approved once the proposed maintenance has been performed.

Stormwater detention required.
(1)
Whenever a site development plan indicates that an adverse impact from stormwater runoff related impact is expected to result from the development of a property, that project shall be required to provide stormwater detention facilities. The meaning of "adverse impact" shall apply when pre-developed flows did not cause difficulties and post-development flows do. Difficulties shall include, but not be limited to, situations where 25-year velocities exceed the non-erosive velocity of the stream, habitable structures are shown to be subject to increased depth of flooding for any frequency up to and including the regulatory flood and stormwater facilities that cannot carry the design storm in accordance with these regulations.
(2)
Should the professional engineer conclude that stormwater detention might not be necessary rigid compliance with all of the following criteria is mandatory:
a.
A site development plan shall always be required whether or not stormwater detention is required.
b.
If the applicant proposes to show that the detention requirement may be eliminated for all or a portion of a project, then a pre-submittal conference with the city engineer is required prior to preparation and submittal of construction plans for the project.

(3)
All stormwater detention facilities shall be designed to detain the one-year storm runoff, for the area draining to the pond, for 24 hours. For the project, this volume called the channel protection volume, shall be equal to or greater than the one-year storm runoff volume from the project. In addition, these facilities shall control the peak flow rates associated with storms having two-year, five-year, ten-year, and 25-year return frequencies so that flows from the developed site do not exceed those associated with pre-development conditions at the project boundary, nor increase the peak flows downstream from the project to the point in the drainage basin where the project area is ten percent of the total basins. Where adverse impacts, as defined in subsection (b)(1) above, occur during the 100-year storm, the 100-year storm shall also be regulated.
(4)
A variety of methods of achieving stormwater management goals shall be acceptable in providing detention facilities. The type of facility provided shall be based on the following criteria:

The maximum size of the orifice to detain the one-year storm for the facility shall be computed using the following orifice equation with a 24 hour draw-down time from the elevation of the total channel protection volume (CPV) and an orifice coefficient of 0.60. The minimum elevation of the two-year control shall be at the maximum routed pool elevation of the one-year storm.
h = Head measured in feet from the elevation needed to store the total one-year runoff volume (CPV) to the centroid of the orifice
Qa = Average CPV outflow rate in cfs
Qa = CPV/3600 x 24
A = Required orifice area in square feet
A = Qa/(0.6 x (64.4 x h/2) 0.5 )

The concept plan will be reviewed and agreed upon between the city engineer or his designee and the design engineer, and will form the basis for the final stormwater facility design.
(12)
In residential subdivisions, no more than 50 percent of the detention facility perimeter may be a wall of any type (unless approved by city engineer).
(d)
Detention facility location criteria.

Detention facility maintenance.
(1)
The detention storage capacity or function of any detention basin, pond or other impoundment, whether natural or manmade, shall not be removed or diminished without the express approval of the city engineer.
(2)
In a residential subdivision, it shall be the responsibility of the mandatory property owners' association to maintain the operational characteristics of any facility constructed on their property for stormwater detention pursuant to city requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of excessive vegetation, overgrowth, trees, obstructions, silt or debris.
(3)

If the developer desires to place a fence around a detention facility, it shall be a minimum four-foot high fence of durable material, with a 12-foot wide access gate. The fence shall be contained within an easement at least 20 feet wide, shall not encroach upon the detention facility (although their easements may overlap by up to ten feet), and shall comply with the locational requirements of title 2 of the city's land development regulations (LDR).
(5)
The side slope in graded areas is to be 3H:1V or flatter. The normal pool ponding surface elevation shall be defined as the elevation when the volume contained in the facility equals the runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event. When the depth to the normal ponding surface is greater than four feet and the side slope is steeper than 4H:1V, a bench shall be provided. The bench shall be at least ten feet in width and is recommended to be 15 feet in width. The slope of the bench shall be 10H:1V.

The fence shall be contained within an easement at least 20 feet wide, shall not encroach upon the detention facility (although their easements may overlap by up to ten feet), and shall comply with the locational requirements of title 2 of the city's LDR. This fencing shall be designed, installed, and maintained to allow the free flow of runoff and sediment into the facility. Gate latches shall be locked with a key, a copy of which must be supplied to the city. The fence shall include a 12-foot gate to permit entrance of equipment necessary to allow periodic maintenance activities. Fencing may be waived by the city engineer or his designee in nonresidential areas when the pond is more than 500 feet from a residential district and in residential districts when retention is provided in natural areas such as stream channels and fencing, when in the opinion of the engineer or his designee, it would damage the environment or affect stream flow.
(h)
Detention facility engineer's certification and record drawings.
(1)
When a new facility is constructed in a development, a certified record survey of each detention facility shall be prepared by a land surveyor currently registered in the State of Georgia. A certified record drawing of the facility shall be prepared based upon this survey. Based on the actual parameters established on the record drawing, an addendum to the stormwater report shall be prepared which demonstrates that the facility, as constructed, complies with the requirements of these regulations. The amended stormwater report shall be certified by a professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia. The survey shall be performed after substantial completion and stabilization of the project has occurred. The record drawing and addendum to the stormwater management report shall be submitted to the city at least one week prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval (as appropriate to the project).
(2)

Sec. 42-408. - Extended detention.
(a)
Extended detention facility design requirements. Wet detention facilities shall be designed and constructed to meet the following requirements:
(1)
Storage volume of permanent pool: The permanent pool storage (Vb) shall be at least 50 percent of the Water Quality Volume (WQV). The part of the WQV (50 percent or less) not used in the permanent pool shall be detained for 24 hours and the storage volume may be used as part of the detention requirements. The WQV to be stored shall be based upon the project area. The project area compensated for in a pond shall not exceed the total drainage area draining to the pond. Off-site areas that do not drain through other water quality BMP's may be used to compensate for areas that by-pass the pond. By-passed areas shall be minimized as much as practical. Off-site areas exceeding the project site area may by-pass the pond.
(2)
Depth of permanent pool:
a.
Mean depth: The mean depth (Z) of the permanent pool shall be between three feet and seven feet and is calculated by dividing the permanent pool storage volume (Vb) by the surface area (As) [(Vb)/(As) = Z].
b.
Maximum depth: The maximum depth of the permanent pool shall be no greater than 13 feet unless a modification is approved. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that the depth of the facility is not out of proportion with the surface area of the facility. Granting of a modification will not nullify these regulations when the depth and surface area of the facility is based on existing natural topography.
(3)
Minimum surface area of permanent pool: The minimum surface area (As) of the permanent pool shall be 0.25 acres. The minimum ratio of surface area to drainage area used to calculate the permanent pool (Aw) in residential watersheds shall be one percent unless a modification is approved. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that the depth is minimized to increase removal efficiencies. Granting of a modification will not nullify these regulations when the depth and surface area of the facility is based on existing natural topography. As/Aw ratios in excess of three percent are desirable for nonresidential watersheds with relatively high levels of imperviousness.
(4)
Side slopes along the shoreline:
a.
The side slope in graded areas is recommended to be 3H:1V or flatter. When the depth of the permanent pool is greater than four feet and the slope is steeper than 4H:1V, a bench shall be provided. The bench shall be ten feet in width and is recommended to be 15 feet in width. The bench shall have a slope of 10H:1V. The bench shall be located so that the permanent pool elevation is between the top and bottom edge of the bench.
b.
Side slopes shall be top soiled, nurtured or planted from two feet below to one foot above the permanent pool control elevation to promote wetland vegetative growth. Below the safety ledge, the pond side shall be sloped to meet topographic or volumetric constraints.
(5)
Length to width ratio of permanent pool: The minimum length: width ratio of the permanent pool shall be 2:1. The length shall be measured at the shortest flow path from the inlet to the outlet. The width shall be calculated as the surface of the pond divided by the length. In addition, the location of the outlet structure within the basin shall maximize travel time from the inlet to the outlet. Baffles or islands may be installed within the permanent pool to increase the flow path length and to minimize short-circuiting.
(6)
Soil permeability: In some cases where relatively permeable soils are encountered, water drawdown rates shall be minimized by either compacting the permanent pool soils during construction, incorporating clay into the soil or by installing an artificial liner.
(7)
Spillway and dam design: The principal spillway, emergency spillway and dam shall be designed in accordance with these regulations.
(8)
Forebay:
a.
To facilitate major cleanout activities, a sediment forebay shall be constructed near the inlet to the permanent pool to trap coarse sediment particles. The forebay volume may be included in the permanent pool volume requirements. The forebay storage capacity shall be ten percent of the runoff from 1.2 inches of rainfall draining to the facility to accommodate sediment accumulations. The forebay should not exceed ten percent of the permanent pool. The volume shall be calculated as:
FBV = (0.1) 1.2 (Rv) A S /12 (ft 3 )
Where Rv = 0.05 +I(0.009)
I = Percent impervious as a whole number
A S = Total on-site area draining to facility (ft 2 )
