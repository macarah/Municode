Sec. 78-64. - Employee personal use of social media.
City of Valdosta employees should be aware of the impact that their personal social media interactions may have on the city's image, as the information posted to social media accounts may be public information for an infinite amount of time. The same standards of conduct, principles and guidelines that apply to City of Valdosta employees in the performance of their assigned duties apply to employee personal social media use. Keep in mind that any activity on social media sites is a reflection on the individual and, because of your public employment, may be a reflection on the City of Valdosta. As with any written, personal communication, you should be discrete, respectful and responsible. Sharing work-related information through personal social media sites is not encouraged, and in some cases may violate city policies, standards, or values. Employees should not represent or give the impression that they are representing the city in an official capacity when communicating on personal social media sites. Do not assume that maintaining "privacy" controls means that the content is completely private. Once information is posted on the Internet it is available and accessible by a variety of people who may share your posts without your knowledge or permission. You are accountable for your on-line activities. Conduct that violates city policies, rules, codes of conduct or guidelines, or that is inconsistent with the city's mission statement or statement of values may result in discipline up to and including termination, particularly but not exclusively where your on-line activity identifies you as a city employee.
(1)
Personal social media activities must not interfere with work duties and responsibilities.
(2)
City employees should be aware that actions captured via images, posts, and/or comments can impact the public's perception and can impact the ability of employees to effectively carry out the business of the city. Material that is inappropriate or harmful to the city or its employees will not be tolerated and should not be posted.
(3)
Some specific examples of prohibited social media conduct include posting commentary, content, or images that are defamatory, pornographic, obscene, proprietary, harassing, libelous, reckless, discriminatory, irresponsible, or that can create a hostile work environment. Engaging in prohibited speech is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment.
(4)
City employees should not publish, post or release any information that is considered confidential or not public.
(5)
Department personnel may not divulge information gained by reason of their authority, make any statements, speeches, appearances, endorsements or publish materials that could reasonably be considered to represent the views or positions of the city without authorization from an appropriate department head.
(6)
Postings and user profiles on personal social media accounts must not state or imply that the views, conclusions, statements or other social media content are an official city policy, statement, position, or communication, or represent the views of the city or any city officer or employee, unless the department director, city manager, or designee have granted right to do so. The use of social media to express disapproval or disagreement with elected officials or city policy/procedures will not be tolerated.
(7)
City employees should not reference or mention city officials, citizens, vendors, customers, or partners without their expressed written consent. At no time, may the City of Valdosta seal, logo or other trademarked images be used for personal use or without permission.
(8)
City employees have no right to privacy with respect to their use of social media or personal social media accounts accessed by means of city equipment or information systems and should not expect or assume privacy or confidentiality with respect to any such social media use or social media content. City employees should expect that any information created, transmitted, downloaded, exchanged, or discussed in a public online forum may be accessed by the city management without prior notice.
(9)
Department personnel should be aware that privacy settings and social media accounts are constantly in flux, and they should never assume that personal information posted on such sites is protected.
(10)
Any employee becoming aware of or having knowledge of any violation to this social media policy should notify his or her supervisor immediately.
