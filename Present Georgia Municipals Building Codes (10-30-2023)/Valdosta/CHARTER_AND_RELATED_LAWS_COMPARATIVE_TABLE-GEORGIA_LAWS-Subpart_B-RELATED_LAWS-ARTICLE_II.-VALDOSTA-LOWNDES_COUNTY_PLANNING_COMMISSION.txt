The board of appeals shall adopt rules in accordance with the provisions of any ordinance adopted pursuant to this act. Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may determine. The chairman, or in his absence the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record.
Appeals to the board of appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the municipality or county affected by any decision of the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the board of appeals a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of appeals after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in a certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril of life and property.

The board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matter referred to it, and give public notice, thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
The board of appeals shall have the following powers:
(1)
To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of any ordinance adopted pursuant to this act.
(2)
To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance upon which such board is required to pass under such ordinance.
(3)
To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board of appeals that:
a.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography, and
b.
The application of the ordinance to this particular piece of property would create practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, and
c.
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved, and
d.
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of the ordinance; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by the ordinance.
In exercising the above powers, the board of appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this act, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit.

Section 13. - Zoning: Conflict with other laws.
Whenever the regulations made under authority of this act require a greater width or size of yards, courts, or require a lower height of buildings or smaller number of stories, or require a greater percentage of lot to be left unoccupied, or impose other more restrictive standards than are required in or under any other statute, the regulations made under authority of this act shall govern.

The ground of disapproval of any plat shall be stated upon the records of the planning commission. Any plat submitted to the planning commission shall contain the name and address of a person to whom notice of hearing may be sent; and no plat shall be acted upon by the planning commission without affording a hearing thereon, notice of the time and place of which shall be sent by mail to said address not less than five days before the date fixed therefor.

From and after the time when the platting jurisdiction of the planning commission shall have attached by virtue of adoption by the planning commission of a major street plan and the adoption by the city council and the county commission of a set of land subdivision regulations recommended to them by the planning commission, no building permit shall be issued for and no building shall be erected on any lot within the municipality or county unless the street giving access to the lot upon which said building is proposed to be placed shall be accepted or opened as, or shall have otherwise received the legal status of a public street prior to that time, or unless such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by said planning commission or on a street plat made and adopted by said planning commission or with a street located and accepted by the city council or county commission. Any building erected in violation of this section shall be deemed an unlawful structure, and the building inspector or attorney or other official designated by the city council or county commission may bring action to enjoin such erection or cause it to be vacated or removed.

The making or certifying of a plat by the planning commission shall not in and of itself constitute or be deemed to constitute the opening or establishment of any street or public building site or public park or playground or the taking or acceptance of any land for such purposes.

For the purpose of preserving the integrity of the official map, the city council or county commission may provide by ordinance or resolution, respectively, that no permit shall be issued for any building or structure or part thereof on any land located between the mapped lines of any street or public building site as shown on the official map. Any such ordinance shall provide that the zoning board of appeals, if the municipality or county has such a board or if not, a board of appeals created for the purpose in such ordinance, shall have the power, upon an appeal filed with it by the owner of any such land, to authorize the granting of a permit for a building or structure or part thereof within any such mapped lines in any case in which such board finds, upon the evidence and arguments presented to it upon such appeal: (a) that the property of the appellant of which such mapped street, or public building site forms a part will not yield a reasonable return to the owner unless such permit be granted; or (b) that balancing the interest of the municipality or county in preserving the integrity of the official map and the interest of the owner in the use and benefits of his property, the granting of such permit is required by considerations of justice and equity. Before taking any such action, the board of appeals shall hold a hearing thereon, at least thirty days' notice of the time and place of which shall be given to the appellant by mail at the address specified by the appellant in his appeal petition. In the event that the board of appeals decides to authorize a building permit, it shall have the power to specify the exact location, ground area, height, materials of construction, and other details and conditions of extent and character, and also the duration of the building, structure, or part thereof to be permitted.
