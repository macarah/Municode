b.
Investing operating funds primarily in shorter-term securities, money market mutual funds or similar investment pools.

Liquidity. The city's investment portfolio must be structured in a manner so as to provide sufficient liquidity to meet all operating requirements which might be reasonably anticipated.
(5)
Return on investments. The city's investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, commensurate with the city's cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.

(c)
Yield. The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described in section 2-576.

DIVISION 5. - DEBT MANAGEMENT POLICY

Sec. 2-611. - Purpose.
The city recognizes the foundation of any well managed debt program is a comprehensive debt policy. A debt policy sets forth the parameters for issuing debt and managing outstanding debt, and provides guidance to decision makers regarding the timing and purposes for which debt may be issued, types and amounts of permissible debt, method of sale that may be used and structural features that may be incorporated. The debt policy should recognize a binding commitment to full and timely repayment of all debt as an intrinsic requirement for entry into the capital markets. Adherence to a debt policy helps to ensure that a government maintains a sound debt position and that credit quality is protected. Advantages of a debt policy are that it:
(1)
Enhances the quality of decisions by imposing order and discipline, and promoting consistency and continuity in decision making;
(2)
Rationalizes the decision making process;
(3)
Identifies objectives for staff to implement;
(4)
Demonstrates a commitment to longterm financial planning objectives; and
(5)
Is regarded positively by the rating agencies in reviewing credit quality.
(Ord. No. 2000-64, § I, 9-7-2000)
Sec. 2-612. - Adoption.
The city's debt policy shall be adopted by resolution of the city's mayor and council. The policy shall be reviewed annually by the finance director, external auditor and the assistant finance director, and any modifications made to the policy must be approved by the city manager, mayor and council.
(Ord. No. 2000-64, § XIV, 9-7-2000)
Sec. 2-613. - Responsibility for developing financing recommendations.
(a)
The primary responsibility for developing financing recommendations rests with the finance director. In developing such recommendations, the finance director shall be assisted by the assistant finance director, budget director and accounting manager, the four of whom shall comprise a debt management committee. The responsibilities of the debt management committee shall be to:
(1)
Meet no less than quarterly to consider the need for financing and assess progress on the capital improvement program;
(2)
Meet, as necessary, in preparation for a financing, review changes in state and federal legislation;
(3)
Annually review the provisions of ordinances authorizing issuance of obligations; and
(4)
Annually review services provided by the financial advisor, bond counsel, paying agent and other service providers to evaluate the extent and effectiveness of services being provided.
(b)
Prior to the quarterly meeting, the assistant finance director and budget director shall jointly prepare a written report on the status of capital improvement program financing. The report shall be based in part on information collected from the primary capital improvement project managers in the city, and shall include a projection of near term financing needs compared to available resources, an analysis of the impact of contemplated financings on the property tax rate and user charges, and a financing recommendation.
(c)
In developing financing recommendations, the debt management committee shall consider:
(1)
The time proceeds of obligation are expected to remain on hand and the related carrying cost;
(2)
The options for interim financing, including shortterm and interfund borrowing, taking into consideration federal and state reimbursement regulations;
(3)
The effect of proposed action on the tax rate and user charges;
(4)
Trends in interest rates;
(5)
Other factors, as appropriate.
(Ord. No. 2000-64, § II, 9-7-2000)
Sec. 2-614. - Bond counsel involvement.
The bond counsel will issue an opinion as to the legality and tax exempt status of any obligations. The city will also seek the advice of bond counsel on all other types of financings, and on any other questions involving federal tax or arbitrage law. The bond counsel is also responsible for the preparation of the ordinance authorizing issuance of obligations and all of the closing documents to complete their sale and will perform other services as defined by contract approved by the city council.
(Ord. No. 2000-64, § II, 9-7-2000)
Sec. 2-615. - Financial advisor involvement.
When necessary, the city will seek the advice of the financial advisor. The financial advisor will advise the city on the structuring of obligations to be issued, inform the city of various options, advise the city as to how choices will impact the marketability of city obligations and provide other services as defined by contract approved by the city council. To ensure independence, the financial advisor will not bid on nor underwrite any city debt issues. The financial advisor will inform the city manager of significant issues.
(Ord. No. 2000-64, § II, 9-7-2000)
Sec. 2-616. - Limitations on indebtedness.
(a)
Established. The city will keep outstanding debt within the limits prescribed by state statute and at levels consistent with its creditworthiness objectives. The city will annually identify intermediate-range to long-range capital spending and debt conditions that would impact city residents' property taxes, and fit proposed spending to the city's debt management goals. The city will exchange information and expertise with each jurisdiction of the county during each jurisdiction's capital improvement budgeting process so that the jurisdictions can eliminate duplication, share facilities, where appropriate, and provide the taxpayers with the greatest return for the jurisdictions' capital improvement.
(b)
Target limitations on nonself-supporting tax general obligation indebtedness; full faith and credit lease-purchase obligations.
(1)
As a matter of policy, the city shall conduct its finances so that the amount of direct, nonself-supporting tax general obligation debt and full faith and credit lease-purchase obligations outstanding at any time does not exceed one percent of the city's taxable assessed valuation. Furthermore, the city shall strive to limit annual debt service requirements on such obligations to an amount that is not greater than ten percent of annual general fund revenues.
(2)
Such limitations shall apply to debt obligations secured by a pledge of the city's full faith and credit obligations which are not self-supporting, or which are paid from the general fund revenues.
(c)
Target limitations on lease-purchase financing of equipment and furnishings. The city may enter into shortterm lease-purchase obligations to finance the acquisition capital equipment and furnishings with estimated lives of less than ten years. Outstanding lease-purchase obligations issued to finance capital equipment and furnishings shall not exceed 0.125 percent of the city's taxable assessed valuation. Repayment of such lease-purchase obligations shall occur over a period not to exceed the useful life of the underlying asset or in any case no longer than five years from the date of such obligations. The debt management committee shall be responsible for developing procedures for use by city departments interested in participating in the lease-purchase program, and for setting repayment terms and amortization schedules, in consultation with participating departments.
(d)
Limitations on general fund loan guarantees and credit support.
(1)
As part of the city's financing activities, general fund resources may be used to provide credit support or loan guarantees for public and private developments that meet high priority city needs. Before such general fund commitments are made, specific policy goals and objectives that determine the nature and type of projects qualifying for support, and specific limitations to be placed on the maximum amount of general fund resources pledged to such projects shall be developed. The department of finance shall be responsible for coordinating the development of such policies and goals, which shall not take effect until approved by the city council. General fund loan guarantees shall be subject to the overall debt limitations set forth in subsection (b) of this section.
(2)
Recognizing the limited capacity of the city's general fund to support both ongoing operating programs and secure longterm debt obligations, use of the general fund to secure such obligations must first be approved by the debt management committee. Key factors that will be considered in determining whether or not the general fund should be used to secure a particular debt obligation will include the following:
a.
Demonstration of underlying self-support, thus limiting potential general fund financial exposure.
b.
Use of general fund support as a transition to a fully stand alone credit structure, where interim use of general fund credit support reduces borrowing costs and provides a credit history for new or hard to establish credits.
c.
General fund support is determined by the city council to be in the city's overall best interest.
(e)
Target limitations on the issuance of revenue-secured debt obligations. The city shall seek to finance the capital needs of its revenue producing enterprise activities through the issuance of revenue-secured debt obligations. Prior to issuing revenue-secured debt obligations, city departments, in consultation with the finance director, will develop financial plans and projections showing the feasibility of the planned financing, required rates and charges needed to support the planned financing, and the impact of the planned financing on ratepayers, property owners, city departments and other affected parties. The amount of revenue-secured debt obligations issued by a city department will be limited by the feasibility of the overall financing plan as determined by the debt management committee. Revenue-secured debt obligations must first be reviewed and approved by the debt management committee before being issued.
(Ord. No. 2000-64, § III, 9-7-2000)
Sec. 2-617. - Structure and term of indebtedness.
(a)
Rapidity of debt repayment. Generally, borrowing of the city should be of a duration that does not exceed the economic life of the improvement that such borrowing finances and, where feasible, should be shorter than the projected economic life. Moreover, to the extent possible, the city should design the repayment of debt so as to rapidly recapture its credit capacity for future use. The city shall strive to repay the principal amount of its longterm general obligation debt by at least 20 percent in five years and 40 percent in ten years. The city may choose to structure debt repayment so as to wraparound existing obligations or achieve other financing planning goals. Such alternative structures shall be subject to the approval of the debt policy committee, in consultation with the involved city departments, before being recommended to the city manager and city council.
(b)
Use of variable rate securities. When appropriate, the city may choose to issue securities that pay a rate of interest that varies according to a predetermined formula or results from a periodic remarketing of the securities. The decision to issue such securities must be reviewed and approved by the debt management committee and city manager before the council is requested to approve the issuance of such securities.
(c)
Pledge of restricted funds to secure debt. The city has the power to make an irrevocable pledge of a security interest in an account created exclusively for the security holders of the city obligations. Before such funds are used to secure a prospective financing, policies regarding the use of such restricted funds shall be developed by the debt management committee to ensure that each use of such funds to secure bonds does not violate restrictions on such funds and that the underlying program commitments can be maintained in addition to meeting debt service obligations on debt secured by the restricted funds. Such policies shall be presented as recommendations to the city manager, then to the council prior to or at the time issuance of the secured debt is to be authorized.
(d)
Use of subordinate lien obligations. Creation of a subordinate lien financing structure, if appropriate, shall be based on the overall financing needs of a particular department, expected credit ratings, relative cost of subordinate lien structure and impacts on the city as determined by the debt management committee, in consultation with the involved department. The results of such review shall be presented in the form of recommendations to the city manager, then to the mayor and council for consideration prior to or at the time such bonds are being authorized.
(Ord. No. 2000-64, § IV, 9-7-2000)
Sec. 2-618. - Creditworthiness objectives.
Considering other components of the guidelines set forth in this division, the city's primary objective is to minimize debt service costs. To measure and compare the cost of alternatives, the city will use net present value and internal rate-of-return analysis. Such objective will be achieved through the following:
(1)
Credit ratings. The city seeks to maintain the highest possible credit ratings for all categories of shortterm and longterm general obligation and revenue debt that can be achieved without compromising delivery of basic city services and achievement of adopted city policy objectives. The city recognizes that external economic, natural or other events may from time to time affect the creditworthiness of the city's debt. Nevertheless, the executive and legislative departments are committed to ensuring that actions within their control are prudent.
(2)
Rating agency relationships. The debt management committee shall be responsible for maintaining relationships with the rating agencies that currently assign ratings to the city's various debt obligations. Such effort shall include providing periodic updates on the city's general financial condition along with coordinating meetings and presentations in conjunction with a new debt issuance.
(3)
Use of rating agencies. The debt management committee shall be responsible for determining whether or not a rating shall be requested on a particular financing, and which of the major rating agencies shall be asked to provide such rating.
(4)
Minimum longterm rating requirements. The city's minimum rating requirement for its direct, longterm debt obligations is a rating of "A" or higher. If such a longterm debt obligation cannot meet such requirement based on its underlying credit strength, then credit enhancement shall be sought to ensure that the minimum rating is achieved. If credit enhancement is unavailable, or is determined by the debt management committee to be uneconomic, then the obligations may be issued without a rating. A lower rating standard may be accepted for indirect or conduit obligations, subject to the approval of the debt management committee.
(5)
Financial disclosure.
a.
The city is committed to full and complete financial disclosure, and to fully cooperating with rating agencies, institutional and individual investors, city departments and agencies, other levels of government and the general public to share clear, comprehensible and accurate financial information. The city is committed to meeting secondary disclosure requirements on a timely and comprehensive basis.
b.
Official statements accompanying debt issues, comprehensive annual financial reports and continuous disclosure statements will meet, at a minimum, the standards articulated by the Municipal Standards Rulemaking Board (MSBR), the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB), the National Federation of Municipal Analysts, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The department of finance shall be responsible for ongoing disclosures to establish national information repositories and for maintaining compliance with disclosure standards promulgated by state and national regulatory bodies.
(6)
Credit enhancements. Credit enhancements (letters of credit, bond insurance, etc.), may be used, but only when net debt service on the bonds is reduced by more than the costs of the enhancements. Selection of credit enhancement providers shall be subject to a competitive bid process developed by the debt management committee.
(7)
Capital planning. To enhance creditworthiness and prudent financial management, the city is committed to systematic capital planning, intergovernmental cooperation and coordination, and longterm financial planning. Evidence of such commitment to systematic capital planning will be demonstrated through adoption of the annual capital improvement plans (CIP).
(Ord. No. 2000-64, § V, 9-7-2000)
Sec. 2-619. - Method of sale.
(a)
Determination of best sale method. In connection with the issuance of each debt obligation, the city shall determine the best sale method, giving consideration to:
(1)
Financial market conditions;
(2)
Issue-specific conditions, such as the type and life of the financed projects and issue size;
(3)
The costs and risks associated with alternative debt structures; and
(4)
City-related conditions, including its credit rating, general financial condition and staff capability to administer the financing.
In all instances, the city shall promote competition in issuing debt. Such promotion will be implemented in the selection of professionals and other service providers, giving consideration to the experience and quality of service, as well as cost. In determining whether to sell the debt on a negotiated or competitive basis, the factors outlined in the Government Finance Officers Association's recommended practice on selecting and managing the method of sale will be followed.
(b)
Competitive sale. As a matter of policy, the city shall seek to issue its debt obligations in a competitive sale unless it is determined by the debt management committee that such a sale method will not produce the best results for the city. In such instances where the city, in a competitive bidding for its debt securities (whether general obligation or nongeneral obligation debt), deems the bids received as unsatisfactory or does not receive bids, it may enter into negotiation for the sale of securities.
(c)
Negotiated sale. When determined appropriate and approved by the debt management committee, the city may elect to sell its debt obligations through a negotiated sale. Such determination may be made on an issue-by-issue basis for a series of issues or for part or all of a specific financing program. Selection of the underwriting team shall be made pursuant to selection procedures set forth in this division, consistent with this Code.
(d)
Private placement. When determined and approved by the debt management committee, the city may select to sell its debt obligations through a private placement or limited public offering. Selection of a placement agent shall be made pursuant to selection procedures developed by the debt management committee, consistent with this Code.
(e)
Official bid form. The city shall design an official bid form to be made a part of each official notice of sale published in conjunction with the sale of debt securities in a competitive sale by the city.
(Ord. No. 2000-64, § VI, 9-7-2000)
Sec. 2-620. - Shortterm debt and interim financing.
(a)
Lines of credit. Where their use is judged by the debt management committee to be prudent and advantageous to the city, the city has the power to enter into agreements with commercial banks or other financial entities for the purpose of acquiring lines or letters of credit that shall provide the city with access to credit under the terms and conditions as specified in such agreements.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2015-20, § 1, adopted Sept. 24, 2015, set out provisions intended for use as § 2-52. For purposes of classification and clarity, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as §§ 2-701—2-710.

Sec. 2-701. - Overview.
The Georgia General Assembly established guidelines and penalties into the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated ("O.C.G.A.") which provides that no municipal corporation shall issue governmental purchasing cards or government credit cards to elected officials on or after January 1, 2016, until the governing authority of the municipal corporation, by public vote, has authorized the issuance and has promulgated specific policies regarding the use of such government purchasing cards or government credit cards for elected officials of such municipal corporation.
(Ord. No. 2015-20, § 1, 9-24-2015)
Sec. 2-702. - Purpose.
The purpose of this policy is to set requirements and standards for the City of Valdosta Purchasing Card Program. The policy is not intended to replace current State of Georgia Statutes, but is intended to comply with such state laws and establish more efficient guidelines for elected officials using such purchasing cards. At no time should a city-issued purchasing card be used for personal purchases regardless of circumstances. Utilizing the purchasing card or credit card for personal use or for any item or service not directly related to such official's public duty may result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to, felony criminal prosecution. All purchases utilizing a City of Valdosta purchasing card must be in accordance with these guidelines and with state law.
(Ord. No. 2015-20, § 1, 9-24-2015)

This purchasing card policy, as required by state law under O.C.G.A. § 36-80-24(c), applies to the use of City of Valdosta purchasing cards by elected officials authorized to be issued such purchasing cards. The Mayor and Council of the City of Valdosta have been authorized by the governing authority of the city to use purchasing cards and must abide by all of the applicable state laws and this purchasing card policy.

Sec. 2-705. - Transaction limits.
Transaction limits are hereby established to insure compliance with state purchasing laws, maintain proper budgetary controls, and to minimize excessive use of any individual credit line. Individual monthly card limits cannot exceed those established by the mayor and council. The established single transaction limit for each card issued to an elected official must be no more than $6,000.00 in the case of the mayor or $3,000.00 in all other cases. The established monthly card limit is based upon the city's budgetary constraints and is no more than $12,000.00 per month for a card issued to the mayor and $6,000.00 for cards issued to other elected officials.
