(Ord. No. 2009-40, 9-24-2009)
Sec. 37-33. - Criteria for certification.
Certification will be granted only in those areas for which the owner has the ability and expertise to manage and control the firm's operations and work.
(1)
To be certified as a VSEB, an individual owner must meet the following criteria:
a.
Reside in one of the counties in the Valdosta Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) for a minimum of one year at the time the application is submitted; or have an established business headquartered for a minimum of three years in Valdosta, and reside in one of the surrounding counties;
b.
Have a personal net worth less than $750,000.00, excluding personal residence, including but not limited to, business value and assets (measured as book value), ownership in other businesses and all other assets personally owned, held in trust for the individual owner's benefit, or held by a spouse. Provided, however, that the following caps apply:
1.
For capital improvement, $3,000,000.00 in annual gross receipts on average, over the immediately preceding three-year period;
2.
For suppliers, $2,000,000.00 in annual gross receipts on average, over the immediately preceding three-year period;
3.
For professional services, $2,000,000.00 in annual gross receipts on average, over the immediately preceding three-year period; and
4.
For contractual services, $1,000,000.00 in annual gross receipts on average, over the immediately preceding three-year period.
These amounts shall be subject to annual analysis by the DCMA or his designee who, should the annual gross receipts in any category change by five percent, will recommend to the mayor and council amounts that may be more appropriate.
c.
Have not been in the program for a total of more than eight years; provided, however, that participation may be increased by two, one-year periods for good cause;
d.
Own and control more than 51 percent of the business entity being certified;
e.
Own any license required by local, state or federal law;
f.
Have expertise normally required by the industry for the field for which certification is sought;
g.
Be a for-profit small business concern;
h.
Not be a front, a broker or a pass-through;
i.
Perform a commercially useful function typical of the field for which certification is granted;
j.
Not be controlled or operate as front by non-VSEB family, former or present employers. Familial relationships where capital is provided for the business will be subject to scrutiny and possible rejection;
k.
The VSEB owner(s) contributions of capital or expertise to acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantial; and
l.
Be a business, including a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or any other business or professional entity:
1.
Which is at least 51 percent owned by one or more of the individuals identified in this section, the ownership of any such business that has been in existence for a year or over must have maintained such 51 percent ownership for at least one year; and
2.
In the case of a publicly owned business, at least 51 percent of all classes of the stock of which is owned by one or more of such persons each of whom meets the personal net worth criteria set forth above; and
3.
Be a citizen or lawfully admitted permanent resident of the United States and be compliant with the residency requirements of the VSEB program.
(2)
Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a VSEB may be certified under the VSEB program. The VSEB owner(s) must actually exercise control over the firm's operations, work, management and policy. Evidence of such controls is as follows:
a.
A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary discretion of such owner. There can be no restrictions through corporate charter provisions, bylaw provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices that prevent the VSEB owner, without the cooperation or vote of a nonqualifying person or entity from making any business decision of the firm.
b.
The VSEB owner may delegate various areas of the management or daily operations of the firm to persons who would not qualify to be VSEBs only if such delegation is typical in the industry for such businesses. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the VSEB must retain the power to hire and fire any such person. The VSEB owner must have an overall understanding of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and expertise, directly related to the firm's operations and work.
c.
The VSEB owner cannot engage in outside employment or other business interests that conflicts with the management of the firm or prevents the owner from devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to manage and control its activities unless such activities would be appropriate with commensurate businesses, in order to avoid sham or fraudulent certifications.
(3)
Only an independent firm may be certified as a VSEB. An independent firm is one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm. Recognition of an applicant as a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is independent. In determining whether an applicant is an independent business, the VSEB program coordinator will:
a.
Scrutinize relationships with non-VSEBs in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
b.
Consider whether present or recent family, or employer/employee relationships between the applicant compromises the applicant's independence.
c.
Examine the applicant's relationships with non-VSEB prime contractors to determine whether a pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with a prime contractor compromises the applicant's independence.
d.
Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-VSEBs with normal industry practices.
e.
An owner shall be certified only for specific types of work for which the owner(s) has the ability and expertise to manage and control the firm's operations and work.
(Ord. No. 2009-40, 9-24-2009)
Sec. 37-34. - Program administration guidelines.
(a)
Valdosta Small Emerging Business Program.
(1)
The city shall identify at least a cumulative total of ten percent of its work in its CIP program during the annual budget submission which shall be accomplished with VSEBs, using sheltered opportunities, prime contracting opportunities and subcontracting goals. The city, through each department head shall commit in its budget to award at least ten percent of its contracts for services, and nonconstruction contracts to VSEBs; provided, however, that such awards shall comply with local, state and federal law and that there exist certified VSEBs to perform the work. These goals are established for the first year of the VSEB program and will be revised based on measurable results after year one.
(2)
In implementing the program, the VSEB program coordinator shall first provide opportunities for direct or prime contracting. Such opportunities should be created by breaking procurement/contracting opportunities packages into smaller components, and separating work that requires licenses from that which does not in separate bid or proposal requests where feasible.
(3)
Subcontracting opportunities should be provided within vertical construction projects, with horizontal construction project opportunities being provided to the maximum extent possible, by prime or direct contracting. Nevertheless, the subcontracting opportunities shall be provided to those trades typically established as subcontractors.
(4)
The city may issue joint checks upon the request of the VSEB in order to facilitate bonding, financing, or other requirements of contracting with the city.
(b)
VSEB program administration. The deputy city manager for administration or designee shall manage and direct the program through supervision of the VSEB program coordinator.
(c)
Access to capital. An access to capital program may be established by the city in conjunction with lending institutions to assist VSEBs with obtaining essential access to capital. Refer to subsection 37-37(d).
(d)
Numerical goals. The percentages set forth below for VSEBs are annual goals and are considered to be targets, not quotas, set to achieve participation levels commensurate with available businesses. The following goals shall pertain to all of the following subsections as applicable: Construction (ten percent); construction-related professional services (ten percent); contractual services (ten percent); and commodities contracts (ten percent).
(1)
Review provision. The goals outlined in subsection (d) above, shall be reviewed on an annual basis and any changes recommended to the DCMA to legislation to modify the goals as applicable.
(e)
Valdosta Small Emerging Business goals. The following goals are for VSEBs in the program:
(1)
The overall small business goal is at least ten percent of the total dollar amount of all eligible contracts on a project by project basis, such that the city may award at least ten percent of total city contracts to VSEBs; provided that such awards do not violate state or federal law and provided further that there are certified VSEBs to perform the work.
(f)
Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(1)
For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a schedule of participation detailing all VSEB and non-VSEB subcontractors from which the bidder/proposer solicited bids or quotations. The entities comprising the VSEB goal of at least ten percent goals as set forth supra shall be identified, or the basis for a waiver for good faith efforts shall be provided with the bid or proposal. The list of VSEBs posted on the city's website establishes the group from which a bidder/proposer must solicit subcontractors under this program. The VSEBs participation shall be due at the time established in the solicitation documents.
(2)
Any agreement between a bidder/proposer that prevents a VSEB from providing quotations to other bidders/proposers is prohibited.
(3)
Joint ventures shall only be allowed under this program in cases that demonstrate legitimate, detailed VSEB partnerships with non-VSEBs, proof of which shall be provided to and approved by the coordinator.
(4)
Where the bidder/proposer cannot achieve the project specific goal(s), the coordinator and DCMA will determine whether good faith efforts have been made. In making this determination, the staff will consider, at a minimum, a matrix to determine the bidder/proposer's efforts to:
a.
Solicit certified subcontractors in the scopes of work of the contract. The bidder/proposer shall provide interested VSEBs with timely, adequate information about the plans, specifications and other such requirements of the contract to facilitate their quotation. The bidder/proposer must follow up initial solicitations with interested VSEBs.
b.
Identify a portion of the work available to VSEBs consistent with their availability.
c.
Negotiate in good faith with interested VSEBs. Price sharing is prohibited in negotiations. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses and telephone numbers of VSEBs that were contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached with them. The ability or desire of a bidder/proposer to perform the work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make good faith efforts on all scopes of work subject to subcontracting.
d.
Facilitate the leasing of equipment supplies or equipment when they are of such a specialized nature that the VSEB could not readily and economically obtain them in the marketplace, where feasible.
(g)
Good faith efforts in lieu of meeting program goals. For a contract with VSEB subcontracting goals, a contractor must comply by either meeting the goal or demonstrating good faith efforts to achieve it that are consistent with the requirements set forth in this chapter. In determining whether a bidder/proposer has made good faith efforts, in lieu of achieving the stated goals, the coordinator, in conjunction with the DCMA, shall consider all relevant factors, which include:
(1)
The ability of other bidders/proposers in meeting the project specific goal(s) may be considered.
a.
A contact log showing the name, address and contact number (phone or fax) used to contact the proposed certified subcontractors, nature of work requested for quote, date of contact, person making the effort;
b.
The description of work for which a quote was requested;
c.
The amount of the quote given, if one was obtained;
d.
The list of departments of work not subcontracted and an explanation why not; and
e.
Subcontractor information as requested by forms developed by the purchasing department.
(2)
For contracts other than for construction related professional services, a signed letter of intent from all listed VSEBs describing the work, materials, equipment or services to be performed or provided by the VSEBs and the agreed upon dollar value shall be due with the bid documents but in no event before the expiration of 48 hours after the submission of the bid.
(3)
For construction related professional services contracts, the highest ranked proposer must deliver at the time of fee and contract negotiations signed letters of intent between itself and the VSEBs to be utilized. If the purchasing agent finds that a bidder/proposer did not make sufficient good faith efforts, the purchasing agent shall communicate this finding to the user department and recommend that the bid/proposal be rejected. A bidder/proposer may protest this determination pursuant to the city's bid protest procedures.
(h)
Continuing obligations of VSEBs and graduation. The certification status of all VSEBs shall be reviewed annually by the program coordinator through recertification application. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation with the program coordinator within 60 days from the date of receipt of written notification from program coordinator may result in being removed from the list of certified VSEBs.
(1)
It is the responsibility of the VSEB to notify the finance department of any change in its circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the program. Failure to do so may result in the firm's decertification and preclusion from future participation.
(2)
The VSEB that no longer meets certification may be decertified at any time.
(3)
A firm, or qualifying individuals, who have participated in the VSEB program for a total of eight years shall graduate from the program.
(i)
Contract performance compliance procedures.
(1)
Upon award of a contract by the city that includes project specific goal(s), the prompt pay obligations in the city's contract with the prime contractor, and the contract between the prime contractor and the subcontractors and subconsultants named in response to this act become covenants of performance by the contractor in favor of the city.
(2)
The contractor shall provide a listing of all VSEBs and any other subcontractors to be used in the performance of the contract, and subcontractor payment information to the city with each request for payment submitted to the city. The coordinator and the user department shall monitor subcontractor participation during the course of the contract and shall have reasonable access to all contract-related documentation held by the contractor.
(3)
The contractor cannot make changes to the schedule of participation or substitute subcontractors named in the schedule of participation without the prior written approval of the DCMA or designee upon recommendation of the coordinator or designated staff person. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this chapter, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause termination of the executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the contractor to contract penalties or other sanctions.
a.
All requests for changes or substitutions of the subcontractors named in the schedule of participation shall be made to the coordinator or designated staff person with a copy to the DCMA in writing, and shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A contractor shall not substitute a subcontractor or perform the work designated for a subcontractor with its own forces unless and until the DCMA or designated staff person approves such substitution in writing. A contractor shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin work until both the DCMA and the user department have approved the substitution.
b.
The facts supporting the request must not have been known, nor reasonably should have been known by either party prior to the submission of the schedule of participation. Bid shopping is prohibited. The contractor must bring this dispute to the coordinator or designated staff person for resolution.
c.
The DCMA's final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis therefore, will be communicated to the parties in writing by the program coordinator.
d.
If the city requires the substitution of a subcontractor listed in the schedule of participation, the contractor shall undertake good faith efforts to fulfill the schedule of participation if the project specific goals would not otherwise be met. If the goal(s) cannot be reached and good faith efforts have been made, the contractor may substitute with non-VSEBs.
(4)
If a contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously disclosed in the schedule of participation, the contractor shall obtain the approval of the DCMA or designee to modify the schedule of participation and must make good faith efforts to ensure that VSEBs have a fair opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(5)
Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the user department at the time they arise, to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the project specific goal(s).
(j)
VSEB and program eligibility.
(1)
Only businesses that meet the criteria of VSEBs may be certified for participation in the program. The applicant has the burden of persuasion.
(2)
Only an independent firm may be certified as a VSEB. An independent business is one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm. Recognition of an applicant as a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is independent. The coordinator must determine that an owner has an independent business in order to certify the business as a VSEB. In doing so, the coordinator will take into account all reasonable criteria for reviewing control of a business.
(3)
The certification status of all VSEBs shall be reviewed annually by the program coordinator. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation with the division within 60 days from the date of receipt of written notification from the finance department may result in decertification.
(4)
It is the responsibility of the VSEBs to notify the finance department of any change in its circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the program. Failure to do so may result in the firm's decertification.
(5)
The DCMA shall decertify a firm that does not meet the eligibility criteria.
(6)
A VSEB may receive no more than five prime contracts per year or an aggregate total value of prime contracts per year in the amount of $4,000,000.00, whichever is greater.
(7)
Joint ventures between VSEBs and non-VSEBs are not eligible for the program, unless they provide structured, detailed, mentoring opportunities, proof of which shall be provided to the coordinator.
(Ord. No. 2009-40, 9-24-2009)
Sec. 37-35. - Counting subcontracting participation of VSEBs.
(a)
The entire amount of that portion of a construction subcontract that is performed by the VSEBs own forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the VSEBs for the work of the subcontract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the VSEBs, excluding supplies and equipment purchased or leased by the VSEBs from the prime contractor or its affiliate, which shall not count as VSEB participation.
(b)
The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by VSEBs for providing a bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract shall be counted, provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c)
If a firm ceases to be a certified VSEB during a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted in the city's internal accounting. No contractor shall be penalized in any way as a result of the failure of a project to achieve its project specific goals because of the operation of this section.
(d)
In determining achievement of a subcontracting participation goal, the participation of a VSEB shall not be counted until the amount being counted has been paid to that entity.
(e)
Achievement of project specific goal(s) shall be evaluated following the completion of the project.
