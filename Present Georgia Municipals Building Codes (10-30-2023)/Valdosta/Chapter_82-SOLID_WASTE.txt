(2)
Method of computing charges. The number of pickups per week, multiplied by the charge per pickup multiplied by 4 1/3 equals monthly charge per container. The size of the dumpster in cubic yards dictates the "charge per pickup."
(3)
Container size defined. The size of each container in cubic yards shall be determined by the director of public works by actual measurement of each container, and this determination shall be final. (Example: (1) containers with a capacity of 3.5 to 4.499 cubic yards shall be considered a four-cubic yard container; (2) containers with a capacity of 4.5 to 5.499 cubic yards shall be considered a five-cubic yard container, etc.).

"Container in use" defined. "Container in use" for the purposes of this section shall mean a container of any size which has, or which is subject to have, any amount of solid waste deposited therein by a business or businesses during any calendar month.
(5)
Minimum fee for container collection. The minimum fee for collection of dumpster shall be determined by the size of the container. The minimum fee charged shall be for one collection per week for each container in use by the customer. The minimum fee shall be imposed for each container in use, regardless of whether or not the solid waste generated each week is less than the capacity of the container.
(6)
Shared containers. When more than one business shares in the use of a dumpster, the total monthly fee shall be divided by the total number of users and each user billed an equal share of the total fee.
(7)
Determination of minimum pickups per week. Unless additional pickups are desired and requested by the users of a container or containers, the minimum number of pickups required by a business shall be determined by the director of public works, using the following procedures:
a.
During one or more weekly periods selected by the director of public works, the cubic yards of solid waste generated by a business or businesses shall be measured and recorded.
b.
Each container of the entire system will be considered separately as to volume and pickups required.
c.
The weekly cubic yard total for each separate container in use shall then be divided by its individual cubic yard capacity to determine the minimum pickups for each container, with any fraction remaining constituting an additional pickup.
d.
When more than one container is required by a business or businesses, the individual charge for each container shall be added to comprise the final charge.
(8)
Container overflow. Should a container or containers in use by a business or businesses become overflowed twice in any given month because of excessive quantities being generated by the user, a charge for an additional pickup shall be imposed by the director of public works, on the user or users of such container.
(9)
Limit on the size of dumpsters. Any container hereafter added into the collection system shall not exceed an eight-cubic yard capacity.
(10)
Weight limit of dumpsters. Limits on the weight of a dumpster served by the city, when filled, shall not exceed 3,000 pounds gross weight.
(11)

For slaughterhouses, chemical businesses, fish houses, or any other commercial or residential establishments which require special handling of solid waste generated by such establishments, the rate shall be computed by the director of public works on the actual cost of handling. The fee shall include collecting, transporting, disposal and all associated overhead costs in each individual case, provided that the sanitation fee imposed and collected with respect to any such place of business shall not be less than the minimum commercial fee, and in respect to any residence shall not be less than the minimum residential fee.
