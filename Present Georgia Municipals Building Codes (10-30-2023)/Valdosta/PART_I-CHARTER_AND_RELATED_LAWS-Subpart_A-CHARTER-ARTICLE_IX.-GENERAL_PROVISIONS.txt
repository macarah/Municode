ARTICLE IX. - GENERAL PROVISIONS
CHAPTER 1. - REGULATION OF CONDUCT

Section 9.1. - Participation in elections.
(a)
No appointed officer or employee of the city shall in any manner contribute to, participate in, or take part in any election, primary, or any political contests, other than by exercising his or her right to vote; provided, the foregoing prohibition shall apply only to those elections, primaries, or political contests for offices of the city. Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be punishable as for violation of a city ordinance.
(b)
The mayor or any councilmember during the current term of office of such person, in order to qualify to run for election to an elective municipal office other than that currently held by such person, must first have resigned from the elective office held by such person at least five days prior to the opening of qualification for such election.
CHAPTER 2. - SALE AND DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY

Section 9.11. - Methods of sale.
The city may dispose of any real or personal property belonging to the city by:
(1)
Private negotiation and sale;
(2)
Advertisement for sealed bids;
(3)
Public outcry; or
(4)
Exchange of property.
Section 9.12. - Private sale.
When the mayor and council propose to dispose of real property by private sale, it shall at a regular council meeting adopt a resolution or order authorizing an appropriate city official to dispose of the property by private sale at a negotiated price. The resolution or order shall identify the real property to be sold and may, but need not, specify a minimum price. The resolution or order shall be published once after its adoption, and no sale shall be consummated thereunder until ten days after its publication.
Section 9.13. - Advertisement for sealed bids.
The sale of property by advertisement for sealed bids shall be done in the manner prescribed by ordinance of the mayor and council; except that, in the case of real property, the advertisement for bids shall begin not less than 30 days before the date fixed for opening bids.
Section 9.14. - Public outcry.
The city may sell real or personal property by public outcry. The mayor and council shall first adopt a resolution authorizing the sale of real property, describing the property to be sold; specifying the date, time, place, and terms of sale; and stating that any offer or bid must be accepted and confirmed by the mayor and council before the sale will be effective. The resolution may, but need not, require that the highest bidder at the sale make a bid deposit in an amount specified in the resolution. The mayor and council shall then publish a notice of the sale once, 15 days before the sale. The notice shall contain a general description of the land sufficient to identify it, the terms of the sale, and a reference to the authorizing resolution. After bids have been received, the highest bid shall be reported to the mayor and council, and the mayor and council shall accept or reject it within 30 days thereafter. If the bid is rejected, the mayor and council may readvertise the real property for sale.
Section 9.15. - Exchange of property.
The city may exchange personal property. The city may exchange any real property belonging to the city for other real property by private negotiation if the city receives a full and fair consideration in exchange for its property. Real property shall be exchanged only pursuant to a resolution authorizing the exchange adopted at a regular meeting of the mayor and council upon ten days' public notice. Notice shall be given by publication describing the properties to be exchanged, stating the value of the properties and other consideration changing hands, and announcing the mayor and council's intent to authorize the exchange at its next regular meeting.
