ARTICLE VII. - COMBINED PUBLIC UTILITIES SYSTEM

Sec. 98-771. - Combined public utilities system; departments created.
The City of Valdosta owns a water distribution system, sewer collection system, stormwater management system and solid waste disposal and garbage pick-up services to users within and beyond the territorial limits of the city. Collectively, these systems shall be operated and maintained as a combined public utilities system. The city manager, or his designee, shall direct and control the operation of said combined system, but may operate such system through separate utility divisions, i.e., water, sewer, stormwater or in such combination as he deems most efficient.
(Ord. No. 2010-23, 6-10-2010)
Sec. 98-772. - Utilities system accounts; establishment of rates.
(a)
The city manager, or his designee, shall keep separate financial books and accounts for the various departments comprising the combined utilities system. It shall be the duty of the manager to place into effect, with approval of the Mayor and Council of the City of Valdosta, schedules of rates, fees and charges for the services, facilities and commodities furnished by the combined system and, as often as it may appear necessary, to revise and adjust such schedules to the extent necessary to produce funds sufficient to:
(1)
Pay the operating expenses of the combined system;
(2)
Pay the principal and interest when due on any revenue bonds and debt obligations of the combined system, including funding of any debt service reserves or credit reserves required thereby; and
(3)
Fund any minimum renewal and extension fund requirements as established by bond ordinance or other proper resolution of the Mayor and Council of the City of Valdosta at least equal to 120 percent of the amount required for the then current fiscal year or accounting period; provided, however, for each of the systems operated, a schedule of rates, tolls, fees and charges for the services, facilities and commodities furnished by each individual system shall be imposed so as to operate each individual system on a sound businesslike basis. For purposes of this section, a system will be deemed to have operated on a sound businesslike basis if net revenues of each individual system at least equal 100 percent of that portion of estimated operating expense, plus debt service, allocable to that system during the current budget period. Such rates, fees, tolls and charges will be classified in a reasonable manner to cover users of the services and facilities furnished by the combined system so that, as nearly as practicable, such rates, fees, tolls and charges will be uniform in application to all users falling within any reasonable class. No free service will at any time be furnished, including to any political subdivision or other public body. No customer will be connected to the combined system or any individual utility thereof without first having executed a service agreement in the form prescribed by the city manager, and paid the applicable connection fees and charges. Where applicable, a proper meter shall first be installed before services or commodities are delivered. To the extent authorized by law, it shall be the duty of the city manager to require the owners of all improved properties accessible to services of the combined system to connect thereto.
(b)
Nothing shall prevent the use of the existing rates now in place for the individual departments from continued applicability under the combined system as long as the revenues aggregately generated are sufficient to satisfy subsections (a)(1)—(3).
(Ord. No. 2010-23, 6-10-2010)
Sec. 98-773. - Audit of combined system.
As soon as practicable after the closing of each fiscal year, an audit will be made of all books and accounts pertaining to the combined system and each individual utility department by an independent certified public accountant or firm of suitable experience and responsibility. Copies of such audit shall be made available to the Mayor and Council of the City of Valdosta and to interested persons as a public record of the city.
(Ord. No. 2010-23, 6-10-2010)
Sec. 98-774. - Right to shut off utilities for repair; emergencies.
The city manager and his department managers shall have the right to shut off utilities for necessary repairs and work upon the system; provided, however, shut-offs shall be planned to the extent possible and reasonable notice given to users by the best available means; in any emergency situation, notice of a shut-off is not required. The city will exercise its best efforts to restore normal levels of service as soon as feasible, considering the nature of the situation and all circumstances. The city shall not be responsible for damages or rebate of fees, rates, tolls and charges for temporary outages or shut-offs, or for compensatory damages allegedly arising from loss of utility services.
(Ord. No. 2010-23, 6-10-2010)
Sec. 98-775. - Termination of services due to nonpayment or other cause.
(a)
In the absence of a written contract with the city creating a property interest or legitimate expectation of continued service, utility users may be terminated due to violation of published rules, regulations and procedures governing service delivery and billing practices of the combined system as promulgated by the city manager. If amounts owed for water, sewer, stormwater management, solid waste disposal and garbage pickup service are not timely paid, all such services shall be disconnected or discontinued. Payment of amounts owed for each utility is a condition of service as to the remaining utilities. Where customers are subject to termination of services due to nonpayment, it shall be the policy of the city to afford the customer a reasonable opportunity for a meeting with a responsible employee of the combined system's customer service division to resolve any dispute prior to the scheduled date of termination. Where notice cannot be given the customer, as shown on the combined system's billing records, or known users at the location where service is provided, after reasonable diligence by the city staff, the city shall retain the right to terminate service upon concluding the amount billed was justly due. Failure by a customer to receive a bill for the current period shall not constitute a defense for nonpayment when services are shown to have been accepted at the service address.
(b)
In the event that service has been cut off for nonpayment of any city utility bill or other action resulting in the unauthorized use of city services, service will not be restored until the unpaid bill and service fees set forth in the schedule established by the city manager and approved by the Mayor and Council of the City of Valdosta from time to time are satisfied. Before service is restored, services fees shall be paid by the user cumulatively for each of the following actions taken to prevent the unauthorized use of city services:
(1)
Turn on after delinquent unauthorized cut off;
(2)
Locking meter;
(3)
Removal of meter;
(4)
Removal of straight line;
(5)
Removal of unauthorized relocated meter; and
(6)
Cutting water off at main.
Payment of these fees shall not exempt any user from any civil or criminal action resulting from a violation of this chapter.
(c)
Pursuant to section 366 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. § 366), the combined utility may not alter, refuse or discontinue service for 20 days after receiving notice of entry of an order for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. Within 20 days after the date of entry of such order, the debtor or trustee acting on the debtor's behalf, shall furnish adequate assurance of payment, in the form of a deposit or other security, to maintain utility service after that date. The amount of such adequate assurance may vary based upon the circumstances of each case.
(Ord. No. 2010-23, 6-10-2010)

(1)
Intentionally and without authority to injure or destroy any meter, pipe, conduit, wire, line, post, lamp, or other apparatus belonging to the combined system;
(2)

(3)
In any way to interfere with the proper action of officers and employees of the combined system;

(c)
Where there is no evidence to the contrary, the person in lawful possession of the premises receiving the benefit of service without proper charge as a result of improper action shall be presumed to be responsible for the act of tampering or diversion.
(d)
Violations of this article shall be prosecuted before the Municipal Court of the City of Valdosta.
(e)
In addition to any fine or imprisonment authorized by this section, upon conviction, a violator may be ordered to pay restitution to the city in the amount found by the court for rates, fees or other charges avoided by the violator's action and for equipment or property of the city or its combined system damaged or destroyed by such action.
