Sec. 10-95. - Returns confidential.
Except in the case of judicial proceedings or other proceedings necessary to collect the occupation tax hereby levied, it shall be unlawful for any officer, employee, agent or city clerk or any other person to divulge or make known in any manner any particulars set forth or disclosed in any occupation tax return required under this article. All contents of said return shall be confidential and open only to the officials, employees, agents or clerks of the city using said returns for the purpose of this occupation tax levy and the collection of the tax. Independent auditors or bookkeepers employed by the city shall be classed as employees. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the publication by the city officials of statistics, so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and items thereof, or the inspection of the records by duly qualified employees of the tax department of the state or of the United States, and other local governments.

Sec. 10-96. - Inspections of books and records.
In any case the city clerk, through his officers, agents, employees or representatives, may inspect the books of the business or person for which the returns are made. The revenue collection officer shall have the right to inspect the books or records for the business of which the return was made in the city, and upon demand of the city clerk, such books or records shall be submitted for inspection by a representative of the city within 30 days. Failure of submission of such books or records within 30 days shall be grounds for revocation of the tax registration currently existing to do business in the city. Adequate records shall be kept in the city, for examination by the city clerk at his discretion. If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of under-reporting, a penalty of 125 percent of the prime interest rate times the amount deficient will be assessed for a period delinquent. For purposes of this section, the prime interest rate shall be that which is published by The Wall Street Journal on the first business day of the year in which the under-reporting is identified.

Sec. 10-97. - Tax registration to be revoked for failure to pay tax, file returns, permit inspection of books.
Upon the failure of any business to pay said occupation tax or any part thereof before it becomes delinquent, or upon failure of any business to permit inspection of its books as provided, any business tax registration granted by the city under this article permitting the owner of said business to do business in the city for the current year shall be, ipso facto, revoked. No new business tax registration shall be granted by the city for the operation of a business for which any occupation tax herein provided is at that time unpaid, or to an individual, firm or corporation who has failed to submit adequate records as requested by the city clerk. In the case of those practitioners where the local government cannot suspend the right of the practitioner to conduct its business, the imposition of civil penalties shall be permitted and pursued by the local government in the case of delinquent occupation tax.
(Ord. of 1-1-1996, § 3-3-24)
Sec. 10-98. - Effect of failure to comply with article provisions; continuing in business after tax registration revocation.
Any person, his managers, agents or employees, who does business in said city after the registration for said business has been revoked as above, and any person, his managers, agents or employees who refuses to permit an inspection of books in his charge when the officers, agents, employees or representatives of the city request such inspection, during business hours, for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the returns herein provided for, shall be subject to penalties provided herein. In the case of those practitioners where the local government cannot suspend the right of the practitioner to conduct its business, the imposition of civil penalties shall be permitted and pursued by the local government in the case of delinquent occupation tax.
(Ord. of 1-1-1996, § 3-3-25)
Sec. 10-99. - Execution of delinquent occupation tax.
In addition to the other remedies herein provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, the city clerk, upon any tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution of the correct amount of said tax against the person, partnership or corporation liable for said tax, which said execution shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property of the person, partnership or corporation liable for said tax, all as provided by the ordinances and Charter of said city and the laws of the state. The lien of said occupation tax shall become fixed on and dated from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the clerk of said city upon the property of the defendant located in said city, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said execution, with interests and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by ordinances and the Charter of said city and the laws of the state, and the defendant in said execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the Charter of said city and the laws of the state in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by the property authority upon an execution issued by the city clerk against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever, for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of the nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of taxes.
(Ord. of 1-1-1996, § 3-3-26)
Sec. 10-100. - Requirement of public hearing.
In any year when revenue from occupation taxes is greater than revenue from occupation taxes for the preceding year for the city, the mayor and council shall hold one or more public hearings as a part of the process of determining how to use the additional revenue.
