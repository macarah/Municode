  (b)

(Zoning Code 1997, §§ 11-4.1, 11-4.2)
Secs. 6-3—6-16. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - P-1 PROFESSIONAL DISTRICT

Sec. 6-17. - Purpose and permitted uses.
(a)
Purpose. This district is established to provide areas for the development of structures for professional services which complement the character of adjacent districts. This district is not intended to accommodate central business or general commercial uses or residential uses, but rather to serve as a transition between more intensely developed commercial areas and residential districts.
(b)
Permitted uses.
(1)
Physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, accountants and similar professional uses which may occupy an entire building or group of buildings.
(2)
Offices of services not involving resident human or animal patients, including medical, dental and other human health services, governmental, civic, social, welfare and charitable services.

Secs. 6-18—6-30. - Reserved.
DIVISION 3. - COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS (NC, C-1, AND C-2)

Sec. 6-31. - General purpose.
These districts are established to provide appropriate areas for the development of commercial and service activities consistent with the existing character of commercial development. Commercial districts should have access from major traffic arteries, however, it is the intent of this division to discourage the development of long, narrow strips of commercial development fronting on major arteries, often referred to as strip commercial areas. Such strip commercial development damages the traffic carrying capacity of streets, increases congestion, is often incompatible with adjacent residential areas, and creates disproportionate costs in the provision of government services. Extension of commercial zoning requiring amendments to this division should be made principally for the provision of planned, unified commercial areas, and not in such a way that strip commercial areas are encouraged. Extension of commercial zoning should only be made after careful consideration of compatibility with adjacent uses and whether or not other land is available which is already zoned for commercial use.
(Zoning Code 1997, § 9-1)
Sec. 6-32. - NC Neighborhood Commercial District.
(a)
Purpose. The NC - Neighborhood Commercial District is established to provide decentralized areas for the retail sales of goods and for personal services, recreational, and institutional establishments which provide the everyday necessities and conveniences of local residents. This district is intended to permit only those nonresidential commercial uses of land and structures which blend smoothly into the character of adjoining residential areas. It is further intended to exclude all activities which generate perceptible light or noise, or attract traffic from outside the immediate neighborhood.
(b)
Permitted uses. In the NC District, the following uses are permitted:
(1)
