Illumination levels.
(1)

The following table reflects said recommended practices of IESNA at the time of adoption of this article:
EXPAND
Maintained footcandles Uniformity ratio-avg: Min
Roadways, local residential 0.4 Avg. 6:1
Roadways, local commercial 0.9 Avg. 6:1
Parking, Residential:
Vehicular traffic 0.5 Avg. 4:1
Pedestrian safety, security and orientation 2 Avg. 4:1
Parking, Commercial:
Vehicular traffic, medium activity lots 2.0 Avg. 3:1
Vehicular traffic, high activity lots 4.0 Min. 3:1
Pedestrian Safety, Security Orientation:
Medium activity lots 0.6 Avg. 3:1
High activity lots 1.5 Avg. 3:1
Walkways and bikeways 0.5 Avg. 5:1
Building entrances 5.0 Avg. -
