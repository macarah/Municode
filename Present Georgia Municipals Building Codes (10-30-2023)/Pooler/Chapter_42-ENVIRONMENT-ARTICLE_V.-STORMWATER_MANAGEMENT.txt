DIVISION 1. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT: IN GENERAL

Sec. 42-151. - Findings.
It is found that:
(1)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage/discharge may have a significant, adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of the city and the quality of life of its citizens. Surface water runoff can carry pollutants and nutrients into receiving waters.
(2)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property and human life.
(3)
Altered land surfaces can change the rate and volume of runoff.
(4)
Adverse water quality and quantity consequences described in this section could result in substantial economic losses. Potential losses include, but are not limited to, increased water treatment costs as well as state and federal fines associated with water quality violations.
(5)
Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management.
(6)
Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the municipal/county separate storm sewer system.
(7)
Current and anticipated growth will contribute to and increase the need for improvement and maintenance of the municipal/county separate storm sewer system.
(Ord. of 12-18-1995, § II)
Sec. 42-152. - Objectives.
The objectives of this division include the following:
(1)

DIVISION 2. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

Sec. 42-180. - General provisions.
Sec. 42-180.1. - Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and increases flooding, channel erosion and pollutant transport and deposition in rivers and streams;
(2)
The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and alters water levels and fluctuations and increases pollutant transport and deposition in wetlands;
(3)
The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and alters salinity concentrations and fluctuations and increases primary productivity and pollutant transport and deposition in estuaries;
(4)
The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and increases bacteria transport and deposition in near coastal waters, which leads to beach contamination and poses a serious threat to human health;
(5)
The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and decreases the amount of rainfall that is available to recharge shallow groundwater aquifers;
(6)
The negative impacts of the land development process on local aquatic resources can adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of the general public;
(7)
The negative impacts of the land development process can be controlled and minimized through the management of stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads;
(8)
Communities located within Georgia's Coastal Nonpoint Source Management Area and Area of Special Interest are required to comply with a number of state and federal regulations that require the adverse impacts of the land development process to be controlled and minimized;
(9)
Therefore, the City of Pooler has determined that it is in the public interest to control and minimize the adverse impacts of the land development process and has established this set of local stormwater management regulations to control post-construction stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites.
(Ord. of 4-16-2012 , § III)
Sec. 42-180.2. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect and maintain the integrity of local aquatic resources and, consequently, the health, safety and welfare of the general public, by establishing local stormwater management regulations that control and minimize the adverse impacts of the land development process. The article seeks to achieve these goals by:
(1)
Establishing decision-making processes that can be applied during the site planning and design process to help protect the integrity of local aquatic resources;
(2)
Establishing post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria to help protect natural resources from the direct impacts of the land development process and preserve existing hydrologic conditions on development sites;
(3)
Establishing post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria to help reduce flooding, channel erosion and pollutant transport and deposition in local aquatic resources;
(4)
Establishing design guidelines for green infrastructure and stormwater management practices that can be used to meet the post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria;
(5)
Encouraging that green infrastructure practices, which include better site planning techniques, better site design techniques and low impact development practices, be used to the maximum extent practical on development sites;
(6)
Establishing provisions for the long-term inspection and maintenance of green infrastructure and stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed and pose no threat to public safety; and,
(7)
Establishing administrative procedures for the submittal, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved development projects.
