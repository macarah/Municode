Sec. 66-1. - Findings, purpose and intent.
(a)
Statement of legislative purpose.
(1)
The city council recognizes that signs provide an important medium through which individuals, businesses, and government may convey a variety of messages. However, left unregulated, signs can become a threat to the public health and safety as a traffic hazard, as a detriment to property values, and as an aesthetic nuisance affecting the overall economic growth of the city. Numerous professional studies have been prepared that examine and establish the effect of signs on traffic safety, aesthetics and economic prosperity, including the following:

(2)
Based on a review of the cited materials and the studies referenced therein as well as other related studies, the city council finds that unregulated signs:
a.
Can be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians;
b.
Can be a detriment to the public health;
c.
Can hamper economic growth;
d.
Can lower property values;
e.
Can adversely impact public investments;
f.
Can degrade the utility of public safety signs; and
g.
Can adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding environment.
(b)
Findings of fact. The city council finds that:
(1)
Signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. However, an improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public;
(2)
The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion and visual clutter caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrians and vehicular traffic;
(3)
Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to an attractive, orderly and safely designed business environment;
(4)
Through proper regulation of signs, the aesthetic attractiveness and economic well-being of the city will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business;
(5)
Concerns about aesthetic and safety issues as balanced with concerns about freedom of expression or speech are reasonably promoted in the city by the provisions of this chapter.
(c)
Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of these sign regulations are:
(1)
To aid in the identification of businesses and other commercial establishments in the city for police, fire and other emergency responses, and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies;
(2)
To protect the public health, morals and welfare from the display of obscene language, nudity and the advertisement of illegal activities, as defined in state law.
(3)
To promote the mental and physical health, safety and welfare of the public by providing for the orderly and harmonious display of signs within the community;
(4)
To maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment by minimizing visual clutter, encouraging a positive visual environment, and avoiding the erection of displays which could produce deleterious and injurious effects to adjacent properties and to the natural beauty of the environment;
(5)
To provide for the safety of the traveling public, both vehicular and pedestrian, by limiting distractions, hazards, and obstructions;
(6)
To promote the use of outdoor advertising adjacent to interstate highways within the jurisdictional limits of the city, consistent with the other purposes of this chapter;
(7)
To maintain the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth and to aid in the identification of properties and enterprises for the convenience of the public; and,
(8)
To encourage the effective use of signs as a means for communication in the city by allowing the maximum amount of expression or speech consistent with the compatibility of such expression or speech with other land uses and with the aesthetic and public health, safety and welfare concerns which the city is charged by law and the Georgia Constitution to preserve and protect.
(d)
Variances. It is further the intent of these sign regulations that variances from the provisions herein not be considered or approved except under extraordinary circumstances in accordance with the findings of fact enumerated under Sec. 66-11(b), as determined by the city council.

(b)
Computation of sign face area.
(1)
Generally.
a.
The area of a sign face or module shall be that of the smallest rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the portion of the sign structure on which is located the sign copy and the background upon which the sign copy is placed. The sign face area does not include any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall is clearly incidental to the display itself.
b.
If a sign face is composed of two or more sign modules separated one from another, the sign face area shall be the area of each module, measured in accordance with the preceding paragraph a, totaled together.
c.
The following are examples of how sign face area measurements are made; the signs shown are illustrative and only provided for clarity.
(2)
Area of multi-faced signs. The sign face area of a single sign structure with more than one side shall be computed as follows:
a.
Signs with three or more faces.
1.
For sign structures having only three sides and the interior angle formed between each of the sides is 60 degrees: while sign faces may be located on all sides, the sign face area shall be taken as the area of the largest sign face on the structure.
2.
For all other multi-faced signs with three or more sides, the sign face area shall be either the largest sign on the structure, or the largest total of all sign faces that are joined by an interior angle of more than 60 degrees.
b.
Double-faced signs. For double-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel (back-to-back), or where the smallest angle formed between the two faces is 60 degrees or less, the area of the sign face shall be taken as the area of the largest side. For double-faced signs where the interior angle formed by the faces is more than 60 degrees, the sign face area shall be the total area on both sides.
(3)
Area of free-form signs. For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes all of the sign's words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors or other design elements shall establish the area of the sign face.
(4)
Kiosks. For a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign face shall be the largest measurement achieved from any view of the sign structure. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on or bisecting the sign structure.
(c)
Height measurements.
(1)
For a freestanding sign structure located within 100 feet of an adjacent street right-of-way (as measured perpendicular to the street), the following applies:
a.
For a sign located on land at or above the crown of the roadway in the adjacent street, the height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the average grade at the base of the sign to the highest point of any portion of the sign. Any earthen berms or other site improvements that raise the sign above the pre-construction natural grade of the land upon which the sign is placed shall be included in the height measurement of the sign.
b.
For a sign located on land below the crown of the roadway in the adjacent street, the height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the crown of the roadway to the highest point of any portion of the sign. Any earthen berms, elevated foundations or other site improvements that raise the sign up to the level of the crown of the roadway shall not be included in the height measurement of the sign.
(2)
For a freestanding sign structure located 100 feet or more from an adjacent street right-of-way (as measured perpendicular to the street), the height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the average grade at the base of the sign to the highest point of any portion of the sign. Any earthen berms or other site improvements that raise the sign above the preconstruction natural grade of the land upon which the sign is placed shall be included in the height measurement of the sign.
(d)
Lighting restrictions. In addition to illuminated signs that are prohibited under subsection 66-3(c), the following applies to all illumination of signs:
(1)
Only permanent signs shall be illuminated, either internally or externally.
(2)
A permit will not be issued for an illuminated sign on a nonresidential property within 100 feet from any property line of a residentially zoned parcel.

(1)
An application for a sign variance shall include all required and pertinent information required in the zoning ordinance pertaining to applications in general and specifically to zoning variances under sections 4(A) and 4(D) of article V.
(2)
Public notice shall be given in the same manner and timing as for zoning actions under section 5 of article V of the zoning ordinance.
(3)
Public hearings shall be held by the planning commission and the city council as required in the zoning ordinance for a zoning decision under section 6 of article V.
(d)
Conditional approval. In granting any sign variance, the city council may impose appropriate conditions of approval which it deems necessary in order to make the requested action acceptable and consistent with the purposes of this chapter, to ameliorate negative issues identified through evaluation of the variance request, or to further the goals and objectives of any plans adopted by the city. Violation of such conditions of approval, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter subject to enforcement under the provisions of section 66-13.
(e)
Longevity. After a sign variance has been granted by the city council it shall be valid for a period of 12 months from the date of approval, within which time a complete and proper application for a sign permit must be received and accepted in accordance with subsection 66-10(c). The sign permit may only be granted for plans consistent with the variance approval and all other applicable requirements of this chapter. Any deviation from the variance as approved will require separate approval by the city council.
(f)
Waiting period if denied. No application for a sign variance that has been previously denied by the city council shall be accepted until the expiration of at least 12 months immediately following the denial by the city council of such sign variance request. However, if the sign variance request is for a lesser relaxation of the standards or for a different request, then an application may be submitted.
(g)
Withdrawal. Any appellant wishing to withdraw a sign variance application prior to final action on the application shall file a written request for withdrawal with the zoning administrator.
(1)
The withdrawal request must be in writing and signed by the owner, the appellant or the owner's authorized agent.
(2)
If the request for withdrawal is received prior to the publication of public notice for the first public hearing, the application shall be withdrawn administratively by the zoning administrator.
(3)
If a request for withdrawal of the application is received after public notice has been published (or irretrievably set for publication) for the first public hearing, the application may be withdrawn without prejudice at the public hearing with the consent of the planning commission and removed from further consideration. The application may be refiled without regard to the waiting period provisions in subsection 66-11(f).
(4)
If the planning commission does not consent to the withdrawal of the application, the city council may take such action as it deems appropriate, including approval, denial or withdrawal with prejudice. An application that is denied or withdrawn with prejudice shall comply with the waiting period provisions of subsection 66-11(f).

Sec. 66-12. - Nonconforming signs.
Any sign that was legally in existence on the effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto, and became nonconforming with respect to the requirements of this chapter or any amendments thereto, may continue in existence as long as the size of the sign is not increased beyond its existing size on the effective date of this chapter, and any change to the sign is made in conformance with this chapter.
(a)
Nonconforming signs—Burden of proof.
(1)
The burden of proof that an existing sign qualifies as a legal nonconforming sign lies with the owner of the sign. Lacking such proof, the sign may be determined to be an illegal nonconforming sign and its removal required.
(2)
Signs for which documentation exists that the sign was erected in conformance with the city's requirements and regulations are considered "legal" nonconforming signs.
(b)
Nonconforming signs; provisions.
(1)
A legal nonconforming sign shall not be replaced, enlarged, or structurally altered except in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(2)
The substitution or interchange of sign copy, poster panels or painted boards on legal nonconforming signs shall be allowed provided the size, shape or location of said sign does not change. The installation of a new or larger electronic changeable copy sign is considered a structural alteration and is not allowed.
(3)
Repair and maintenance of legal nonconforming signs may be performed as necessary unless more than 50 percent of the sign is repaired, altered, or replaced, as determined by the zoning administrator. If more than 50 percent of the sign is affected, then any legal nonconforming status is lost and the sign must be brought into compliance with the current sign regulations; provided that signs damaged by fire or act of God may be restored to their original condition.
(c)
Relocation of a nonconforming sign.
(1)
An existing sign that was legally erected and that becomes nonconforming as to the setback requirements of the city due to road widening may be moved to meet the setback requirements of this chapter. Such sign shall not be increased in size or changed in any manner except as to become conforming.
(2)
Any sign erected to replace a legal nonconforming sign must meet all requirements and provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. of 6-15-2015 , § II)
Sec. 66-13. - Administration, enforcement, and penalties.
(a)
Enforcement.
(1)
All of the provisions of this chapter shall be administered by the zoning administrator, including the rendering of interpretations as to the requirements of this chapter, and enforced by the building inspections department whose duties shall include: issuing sign and related building permits, inspecting signs, and enforcement of all provisions of this chapter.
(2)
All questions arising in connection with the administration and interpretation of this chapter shall be presented first to the zoning administrator and then to the city council on appeal of a decision from the zoning administrator.
(3)
A sign permit may be revoked by the building inspections department, if it is found not to be in compliance with this chapter due to intentional misinformation, misrepresentation, or significant error on the sign permit application.
(4)
Issuance of a sign permit in no way prevents the building inspections department from later declaring the sign to be nonconforming or unlawful if upon further review of available information the sign is found not to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
(b)
Inspections.
(1)
The building official shall inspect or cause to be inspected, by a duly authorized representative, every sign, after issuance of a sign permit, during or upon its installation in order to determine that each such sign meets the requirements set forth in this chapter. Inspections shall include but are not limited to, footings and electrical wiring.
(2)
It shall be the duty of the building official or a duly authorized representative to notify the sign contractor (if known) and the sign owner or property owner, of any discrepancies or violations found during the sign inspection. This notice shall be in writing and provide the specifics as to the discrepancies or violations found during the inspection and may be served in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested.
(3)
All deficiencies or violations shall be corrected, within 48 hours, following service of this notice by the building official or a duly authorized representative. The building official or a duly authorized representative may extend the time limit to correct the violation no more than seven days or reduce the limit no less than 24 hours.
(4)
The building official or a duly authorized representative is herein authorized to enter private property for the purpose of making an inspection to insure compliance with all provisions of this chapter.
(5)
The building official or a duly authorized representative shall have the authority to cause to be removed after due notice any sign which shows gross neglect or becomes dilapidated by giving the owner ten days written notice to correct the deficiencies or to remove the sign(s). If the owner refuses to comply, the building official or a duly authorized representative shall have the authority to have said sign(s) removed at the expense of the owner.
(c)
Abandoned signs.
(1)
If a building, structure or premise is vacated, any associated temporary signs shall be removed by the property owner or the sign owner within ten days, following service of notice by the building official or a duly authorized representative. If the property owner or sign owner fails to comply within ten days after written notification, the building official or a duly authorized representative may cause the removal of the sign at the property owner's or sign owner's expense.
(2)
If a nonconforming sign or sign structure has not been in use whereby the property has been vacated for a period of three months or longer and the sign has not been updated to convey a current message, any such sign on the property, building, or structure loses its legal nonconforming status and must be removed or brought into compliance with the current sign regulations.
(d)
Administrative fees, citations and penalties.
(1)
The city's code enforcement officer and any other sworn officer of the City of Pooler is hereby empowered to issue a citation for violation of this chapter in any case where it is found that a sign has been erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted or maintained in violation of any provision of this chapter. Temporary event signs still erected after the expiration date of the approved sign permit shall be removed by the owner/applicant or a citation will be issued for violation of this chapter.
(2)
Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in section 1-12 of the city's code of ordinances.
(Ord. of 6-15-2015 , § II)
Sec. 66-14. - Intent, interpretation and severability.
(a)
In interpreting the provisions of this chapter, nothing shall be construed as intent to regulate the content of the message displayed on any sign.
(b)
All signs may display a non-commercial message constituting personal speech in addition to or in lieu of any other message. It is the intent of this chapter to regulate only the number, type, size, height, timing, appearance and location of signs to accomplish the purposes set forth in section 66-1 of this chapter, except as otherwise provided herein.
(c)
In the event any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional including, but not limited to, a declaration or adjudication that such section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of the chapter relates to the content of any sign or in any way violates the constitutional provisions of free speech under the State of Georgia or United States Constitution, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the other sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases of this chapter, which shall remain in full force and effect as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase so declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part thereof. The city council hereby declares it would have adopted the remaining parts of the chapter if it had known that such part or parts thereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional. The provisions of this chapter are declared severable to the maximum extent allowed by law.
