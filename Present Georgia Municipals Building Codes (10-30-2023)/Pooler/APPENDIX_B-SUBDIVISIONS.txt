Sec. 702. - Preliminary plan.
An original and four prints of a preliminary plan, showing the proposed design of the subdivision, shall first be submitted to the planning commission for approval.
Until the preliminary plan of a proposed subdivision has been approved by the planning commission and the aldermanic board a developer shall not grade, scrape, or otherwise open or extend a street in the proposed subdivision, nor shall he in any manner cause construction to actually begin on a subdivision.

(b)
The location of any streams, natural drainageways, and other waterways which exist on the property.

(b)
Copies of any permit applications required by state or federal agencies must be attached at time of submittal of preliminary. Examples of applications are permit for wetland filling, extension of water and sewer lines, land disturbing activities (soil erosion and sedimentation) and curb cuts from DOT, DOT R-O-W encroachment, etc.
Failure to submit copies of state and federal permit applications with the preliminary plan submittal, when it was known or should have been known by the applicant or his agent, will cause the review process by the planning commission to stop, until such time as the proper submittals are received.
(c)
A statement from the subdivider shall be placed on the preliminary plan which shall describe the method by which storm sewers, sanitary sewers, and water facilities will be provided. If septic tanks or individual waste disposal systems are to be used in a subdivision, then percolation tests shall be made in accordance with county health department requirements and the results of such test, together with a contour map showing the site of each test hole, shall accompany the preliminary plan.
(d)
Grading and drainage plans shall be submitted with each subdivision application. If the required drainage plans reveal that a request for subdivision approval would overload the capacity of the channel downstream or increase flood stages upstream, the subdivision approval permit shall be denied, unless equivalent flow and storage capacity is replaced and maintained by the owners within the drainage basin affected.
(e)
When the preliminary plan includes only a part of the tract on which the subdivider has an interest, the developer shall submit a tentative street plan for all of said tract.
(f)
All exhibits accompanying the preliminary plan shall be prepared by a Georgia registered civil engineer and shall exhibit the seal of such engineer.
(702.02) Filing of preliminary plan. The preliminary plan shall be submitted to the building official to process and review prior to the submittal of the preliminary plan. If the building official determines the submitted preliminary plan does not contain all the required information, the building official shall return the preliminary plan to the applicant to complete. The preliminary plan shall be resubmitted to the planning commission not less than 30 days prior to the regular planning commission meeting at which it is to be considered.
(702.03) Process. Upon submittal of the preliminary plan, the building official will review the plan for noticeable discrepancies and determine if there is a need for additional information.

Once the comments from the review has been submitted to the building official, the plan shall be placed on the agenda of the next planning commission meeting. Until the applicant addresses all of the engineer's comments and the preliminary plan is satisfactory, the aldermanic board will not review the plan.
(702.04) Action on preliminary plan. If the planning commission finds that the proposed design of the subdivision shown on the preliminary plan complies with the design requirements of these regulations, it shall recommend approval of such preliminary plan to the aldermanic board.
If the planning commission finds that the proposed design of the subdivision shown on the preliminary plan does not comply with the design requirements of these regulations, then the planning commission shall either recommend disapproval of such plan or shall recommend approval of such plan on the condition that specified violations are corrected prior to the submittal of the final plan. When the planning commission recommends disapproval of a preliminary plan, it shall give the developer the reasons for such disapproval in writing.
Except where an extension of time is authorized by the applicant for preliminary plan review, the planning commission shall have 30 days from the date of the submission of a complete preliminary plan to act on such plan. Unless action is taken on an application for preliminary plan review within the 30-day period, a written recommendation of approval shall be issued by the planning commission on the demand of the applicant. The aldermanic board, upon receipt of a recommendation from the planning commission, within 30 days of planning commission action shall hold a public hearing thereon and shall notify in writing all abutting property owners and the developer of the subdivision of the time, date, and place of said hearing. The aldermanic board may either approve, disapprove, or require modifications to the subdivision plat.
Any substantial change or modification, which differs from sketch plan or changes lot layout, of the preliminary plan required by the aldermanic board must be reviewed by the planning commission for consistency with other regulations. The review must occur by the next official meeting of the aldermanic board.
(702.05) When preliminary plan approved, work may proceed. When a developer receives approval of the preliminary plan showing the design of his proposed subdivision, he may proceed with the construction of the subdivision. Such construction shall conform with the design submitted to and approved by the aldermanic board.
(702.06) The limit on preliminary approval. The aldermanic board's approval of a preliminary plan shall be valid for one year. If work has not started on a subdivision which has been granted preliminary plan approval on or before the end of this one-year period, then the plan of such subdivision shall be resubmitted for preliminary approval; provided, however, that this time may be extended unless changes have occurred in this ordinance, or in the character of the property surrounding the property of the proposed subdivision, which makes it necessary to revise the design of the proposed subdivision.
