Chapter 98 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

Sec. 98-1. - Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants, and stormwater runoff, soil erosion and non-point source pollution can be minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites.
(2)
The City of Waynesboro establishes this chapter for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and non-point source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety.
(Code 1995, § 51-1)
Sec. 98-2. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, environment and welfare of the public and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding, siltation and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
(2)
Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development, which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
(3)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, non-point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(4)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(5)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum stormwater management standards;
(6)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of stormwater control facilities and practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained and pose no threat to public safety; and
(7)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.
(Code 1995, § 51-2)
Sec. 98-3. - Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this chapter should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
(Code 1995, § 51-3)
Sec. 98-4. - Variances and waivers.
Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by this chapter unless they file a written request to waive the stormwater management plan requirements or allow a variance to a specific requirement of this chapter. A formal, written application shall be filed with the City of Waynesboro and shall include the specific variances sought and sufficient justification for granting the variance or waiver. Variances and waivers may only be granted if all of the following conditions apply:
(1)
Good and sufficient cause for the variance or waiver is shown by the applicant;
(2)
It is determined by the City of Waynesboro that the failure to grant the variance or waiver could result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
(3)
It is determined by the City of Waynesboro that the granting of a variance or waiver will not result in increased flood heights or additional threats to public health or safety, water resources and aquatic life, or public or private property; and
(4)
It is determined by the City of Waynesboro that the granting of a variance or waiver will not result in nuisances or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(Code 1995, § 51-5)
Sec. 98-5. - Development of a stormwater design manual.

Sec. 98-9. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria.
The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter:
(1)
Water quality. Reserved.
(2)
Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer;
b.
24-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event if required to protect downstream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation;
c.
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.
(3)
Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by limiting (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development peak discharge for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If extended detention of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (2)b of this section is not provided, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year, five-year, ten-year, and 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. Refer to section 98-8(b) for the required calculations to be submitted. For sites less than 2,000 acres, the SCS unit hydrograph method shall be used unless the city administrator provides prior approval of another method. The rational method may only be used for sites of less than 25 acres and may only be used to design storm sewer systems including gutter flow and inlets, storm drain pipes, culverts, and small ditches. In no case shall the rational method be used for designs involving the storage of stormwater runoff including detention ponds.
(4)
Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24 hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. The 100-year event must be routed through the site without overtopping any dam. Refer to section 98-8(b) for the required calculations to be submitted. For sites less than 2,000 acres, the SCS unit hydrograph method shall be used unless the city manager provides prior approval of another method. The rational method may only be used for sites of less than 25 acres and may only be used to design storm sewer systems including gutter flow and inlets, storm drain pipes, culverts, and small ditches. In no case shall the rational method be used for designs involving the storage of stormwater runoff including detention ponds.
(5)
Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using criteria accepted by the city manager. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city manager may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased non-point source pollution loads created on the site in question.
(6)
Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include, but are not limited to, culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following minimum requirements:
