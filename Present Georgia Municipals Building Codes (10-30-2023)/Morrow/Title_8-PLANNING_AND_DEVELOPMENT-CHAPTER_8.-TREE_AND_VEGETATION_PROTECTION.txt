--- (9) ---
Editor's note— Formerly, Art. A, §§ 8-8-1, 8-8-2, pertained to tree harvesting and was derived from Ord. No. 94-90, adopted Aug. 23, 1994. Such provisions were deleted by Ord. No. 98-15, § 1, adopted Nov. 24, 1998, and new provisions were enacted by such ordinance to read as set out in §§ 8-8-1—8-8-10.

Sec. 8-8-1. - Definitions.
The following definition of terms shall apply to this article:
Buffer: That portion of a lot set aside with adequate natural or planted vegetation to accomplish visual and sound screening to separate residential zoning districts from other zoning districts as required in the city zoning ordinance.
Clearing: An activity which removes or disturbs the vegetative cover, including trees.
Crown dripline: A vertical line extending from the outer surface of a tree branch tip to the ground.
Deciduous tree: Any tree which drops its leaves at the end of a growing season.
Dripline area: The total area underneath a tree which would encompass all crown driplines.
DBH: Diameter-at-breast height is a standard measure of tree size, and is the trunk diameter measured in inches at a height of four and five-tenths feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below four and five-tenths feet, each trunk is measured separately, and the total trunk diameters are added together. A tree which splits into multiple trunks above four and five-tenths feet is measured as a single tree at four and five-tenths feet.
Evergreen: Any tree which retains its foliage throughout the year.
Landscaping: Any additions to the natural features of a plot of ground to restore construction disturbance and to make it more attractive, as by adding lawns, trees and shrubs, etc., to the natural environment.
Landscape area: An area set aside for the installation and maintenance of planting materials.
Landscaping ordinance: A document which establishes requirements as to the number, size and type of vegetation for landscaping improvements.
Land and vegetation disturbance permit: A permit issued to authorize the cutting, transporting and clearing of vegetation.
Natural vegetation: A generally undisturbed, maintenance-free, self-perpetuating stand of vegetation comprising indigenous shrubs, flowers, and wild grasses and trees.
Natural vegetation area: The area within the boundaries of a given lot which is devoted to natural vegetation.
Protection area: All land which falls outside the buildable area of a parcel, all areas of the parcel required to remain in open space, the dripline areas beneath a tree or clusters of trees to be retained, and/or all areas required to remain landscape strips or buffers according to the city zoning ordinance or conditions of zoning approval.
Shrub: A woody plant or bush of relatively low height (two to six feet), distinguished from a tree by having several stems rather than a single trunk.
Specimen tree or stand: Any tree or grouping of trees which has been determined to be of high value because of its species, size, age or location. General criteria for the determination of specimen trees or stands are as follows:
(1)
Any deciduous tree whose DBH equals or exceeds 30 inches.
(2)
Any evergreen tree whose DBH equals or exceeds 24 inches.
(3)
Any understory tree whose DBH equals or exceeds ten inches.
(4)
Any tree which has a significant historical value and can be documented through historical records or otherwise, and any tree which has exceptional aesthetic value.
Tree harvesting: The cutting of more than 15 trees per year for purposes not related to immediate land development or in conjunction with an ongoing development project.
Understory tree: Any tree or woody plant which is of lesser height and spread than the surrounding evergreens or deciduous trees but which still provides shade and a degree of protection to the earth and vegetation beneath it.
(Ord. No. 98-15, § 1, 11-24-98)
Sec. 8-8-2. - Applicability.
This article shall apply to any activity which involves the removal of trees in the city.
Exemptions from the tree protection ordinance [this article] are:
(1)
Dead, diseased or infested trees as determined by the Georgia Forestry Commission and/or its local representative(s).
(2)
Orchards and tree nurseries in active commercial operation.
(3)
The homeowner of a developed, single-family residential lot removing a tree or trees will be required to obtain a permit but will be exempt from paying a permit fee. In the case of a tree contractor removing a tree or trees in a residential area, the contractor will not be required to submit a site plan.
(Ord. No. 98-15, § 1, 11-24-98)
Sec. 8-8-3. - Land and vegetation disturbance permit required.
Unless specifically exempted from this article, all owners, developers of land, or contractors, must secure a land and vegetation disturbance permit prior to the removal, relocation or transportation of any trees in the incorporated city limits.
(1)
Procedure: Four copies of a tree protection plan (TPP) must be submitted to the city public works director, or his designee, for review to ascertain conformance to the tree protection ordinance prior to application for a land and vegetation disturbance permit and/or application for development plan and preliminary plat approval. It is advised that a qualified landscape architect, Georgia Forestry Commission (GFC) Certified Urban Forester, or Arborist prepare the TPP.
The TPP must include:
a.
The exact location of all existing trees and specimen trees more than ten inches in diameter clearly indicating those which will be retained to meet the tree protection requirements, their size, dripline area and species.
b.
The location, size and species of all replacement trees.
c.
The boundaries of all required buffer areas.
d.
The boundaries of all existing and proposed landscaped areas.
e.
The boundaries of all existing and proposed buildings.
f.
The boundaries of all vehicle and pedestrian use areas.
g.
All existing and proposed utilities (i.e., water, sewer, stormwater drainage and retention facilities, etc.), and all existing and proposed utility poles and/or light poles.
Upon submittal of the TPP, the public works director, or his designee, shall:
a.
Conduct a preliminary review of the TPP.
b.
Conduct an on-site inspection to determine if there are any trees of exceptional aesthetic or historical value.
c.
Return the TPP either approved or with changes which must be made prior to the issuance of a land and vegetation disturbance permit.
After final approval of the TPP by the public works director, or his designee, development plans and plats can be forwarded for review, or the land and vegetation disturbance permit can be issued. Plans will be considered approved if no decision is made by the city within 30 days of the submission of the TPP.
(2)
Compliance. It is the responsibility of the public works director, or his designee, to review the TPP to ascertain compliance with the provisions of the tree protection ordinance before a land and vegetation disturbance permit will be issued. It is also the responsibility of the public works director, or his designee, to conduct a final inspection for compliance with the tree protection ordinance before a certificate of occupancy or acceptance of streets will be granted.
(3)
Appeal procedure. Any applicant for a land and vegetation disturbance permit who is aggrieved by any decision of the public works director, or his designee, relating to the application of this article shall have the right to appeal to the city manager. Such appeal shall be requested in writing no less than ten days after the decision has been made. The appeal shall be heard by the city manager within 30 days after the receipt of the appeals request. The city manager shall have the right to overturn, modify or affirm the decision made by the public works director, or his designee.
(Ord. No. 98-15, § 1, 11-24-98)
Sec. 8-8-4. - Tree protection requirements.
Property subject to the Morrow Tree Protection Ordinance shall retain a minimum of 20% of all trees more than ten inches in diameter. Trees which fulfill this preservation requirement shall be exclusive of the required buffer areas. Every five caliper inches of trees preserved shall count one caliper inch toward the density requirements of the city landscaping ordinance.
(Ord. No. 98-15, § 1, 11-24-98)
Sec. 8-8-5. - Guidelines for tree protection.
Listed below are guidelines for tree protection to be followed during the grading and construction process, and for the continued maintenance of trees:
(1)
All individual standalone trees to be retained on a site must be marked with orange engineering tape, tied around the trunk of the tree at a height of five feet above the ground.
(2)
The tree protection area (dripline area) of standalone trees and stands of trees will be marked with standard construction fencing (orange) or four foot silt fence with stakes placed every ten feet.
(3)
If initial development is limited to streets, drainage easements and utilities, a TPP indicating only trees equal to or in excess of ten inches DBH which are to be removed must be submitted. During street and utility construction, the grading permit shall be limited to the areas needed for street right-of-way.
(4)
If it is determined that irreparable damage has been done to a tree in a tree protection area, the developer, the builder and/or owner shall be responsible for the replacement of that tree as provided for in this article under "Guidelines for replacement."
(5)
All areas not devoted to structures, access ways, dumpsters, storage, roads, parking lots and natural vegetation shall be landscaped.
(6)
The city zoning department may require landscaping in conjunction with the issuance of a building permit not requiring plat or site approval.
(7)
All trees planted in accordance with this article shall be of a species approved by the city.
(8)
The planting of trees to meet the requirements of this article shall be on the front or side of the developed areas and plantings behind a building shall not be counted in determining the minimum requirements of this section unless specifically authorized by the city.
(9)
The care and maintenance of trees shall be the responsibility of the current owner. Trees which become diseased or dysfunctional shall be replaced.
(Ord. No. 98-15, § 1, 11-24-98)
Sec. 8-8-6. - Guidelines for tree replacement.
(a)
If the tree preservation requirements of this article make reasonable use of a property impossible or if a tree in a tree protection area is irreparably damaged, the following replacement requirements shall be followed after the construction process is complete:
(1)
The trees shall be replaced diameter inch for diameter inch with a minimum of three-inch DBH trees of the same species. If the species of the existing tree is unsuitable for replacement (refer to section 8-8-6(b)) or is unavailable, an inch for inch replacement of minimum three-inch DBH trees of a suitable species (refer to section 8-8-6(b)) shall be planted.
(2)
All trees selected for replacement must be quality specimens free of disease, injury or infestation, and must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing area (refer to section 8-8-6(b)).
(3)
All replacement trees must be planted before a certificate of occupancy is issued or streets and easements will be accepted.
(4)
Replacement trees planted shall fall under the maintenance provisions of the City of Morrow Landscaping Ordinance.
(5)
Specimen trees shall be replaced with specimen trees and understory trees shall be replaced with understory trees (refer to section 8-8-6(b)).
(6)
Where the minimum tree diameter cannot be met due to natural site constraints, the developer or builder shall provide the remaining balance of the required trees for planting on public property.

Where appropriate, other permeable ground cover, such as mulch and stones, may be used as an alternative to the ground cover listed in this section. However, alternative forms of ground cover must be specifically approved by the mayor and council of the city.
(Ord. No. 98-15, § 2, 11-24-98)
Sec. 8-8-15. - General regulations for landscaped areas.
There are no prescribed criteria for design or formation of the landscaped area. However, it should be consistent with the architectural scheme of the building and surrounding area and should complement the plan for sediment and erosion control of the site.
The requirements of the previous paragraphs shall be in addition to buffer zones and tree protection areas; however, some relief of the above described requirements may be granted, by the mayor and council, for saving existing trees, shrubbery and ground cover on the site.
Industrial, commercial, office and institutional, business park and multifamily sites one acre or less must be landscaped entirely.
All guard rails must be primed and painted a beige color and/or screened from view by additional landscape material.
Parking lot islands. For every fifty parking spaces, a landscape island having a minimum dimension of ten feet by 38 feet shall be installed, and at each end of the parking aisle a landscape island having a minimum dimension of 20 feet by 38 feet shall be installed in order to separate the last space from any adjacent travel ways. One in every four parking rows must be divided by a minimum fifteen foot wide landscape strip (for landscape purposes).
Irrigation system. The landscaping plan must include an irrigation plan to sustain plant life. Any and all plant materials that fail to survive must be replaced by the property owner.
(Ord. No. 98-15, § 2, 11-24-98; Ord. No. 2003-05, § 1(B), 5-13-03)

Sec. 8-8-17. - Enforcement and penalties.
The foregoing requirements shall be mandatory for all industrial, commercial, office and institutional, business park and multifamily developments constructed in the city.
Failure to provide and adhere to the industrial, commercial, office and institutional, business park and multifamily landscaping requirements shall be grounds for denial of a building permit for such developments, the issuance of a Stop-Work Order for such developments, the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or the revocation of the business licenses of the builder and/or tenants of the development.
Furthermore, the maintenance of the landscaping, including the replacement of trees, shrubs and ground cover, is the sole responsibility of the property owner(s). Upon finding a violation, the code enforcement officer of the city shall notify the property owner(s), in writing, and the owner shall be given 30 calendar days from the date of notification to bring the site into compliance. If the property is in violation after that time, the code enforcement officer shall issue a citation against the property owner(s) of a site in violation with a maximum fine of $1,000.00. Each day the violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.
