Sec. 8-6-5. - Procedure for tentative approval of preliminary plat of subdivision.
(a)
Following the preapplication review of a proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall submit to the secretary of the planning and zoning board, at least 15 days prior to the next regular meeting of the planning and zoning board, the following:
(1)
A letter requesting review and approval of a preliminary plat and giving the name and address of a person to whom the notice of the hearing by the planning and zoning board on the preliminary plat shall be sent; and
(2)
Ten copies of the preliminary plat and other documents, as specified in section 8-6-7.
(b)
The secretary of the planning and zoning board shall check the plat for conformance to the rules and regulations of this chapter and report the findings and recommendations to the planning and zoning board and the mayor and council, who shall arrange a hearing on the preliminary plat, notice of the time and place of which shall be sent by the secretary of the planning and zoning board by mail to the person designated in the letter requesting preliminary plat review and approval, not less than five days prior to the date of the hearing.
(c)
Thereafter, the planning and zoning board shall recommend to the mayor and council their approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat. A notation of the action taken by the planning and zoning board shall be made on two copies of the preliminary plat. A statement by the planning and zoning board concerning their recommendations shall be given to the subdivider or developer or their agent and one copy of the preliminary plat shall be returned to the subdivider or developer showing the suggested and recommended changes of the planning and zoning board. Another copy with the same information thereon shall be made available to the secretary for presentation to the mayor and council for their review which shall take place at the next regularly scheduled meeting of that body. A third copy shall be retained by the secretary for inclusion in the records of the planning and zoning board.
(d)
Approval of a preliminary plat does not constitute approval of a final plat. It indicates only approval of the layout as a guide to the preparation of the final plat. Tentative approval shall expire and be null and void after a period of one year unless an extension of time is approved by the planning and zoning board.
(e)
If action on a preliminary plat is not taken within 30 days of the date of submission, the preliminary plat shall be considered approved and a certificate of approval shall be issued on demand. However, the applicant for approval may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of time.
(f)
Approval of the preliminary plat and grading and drainage plans shall constitute authorization to proceed with the installation and construction of all improvements. Provided, however, no installation of improvements shall be made, and no work commenced in connection with said preliminary plat, or subdivision thereof, until the said subdivider shall furnish to the city a bond in a penal sum equal to the full cost of required improvements, as estimated by the mayor and council on recommendation of a designated engineer, conditional upon the completion of required improvements within such reasonable period as may be set by said mayor and council, and a further bond in the penal sum of one-third of such estimated construction cost, for the maintenance of such improvements in their original condition for one year after completion.
(g)
The subdivider shall install improvements in accordance with the preliminary plat, the grading and a drainage plan, and the specifications and standards required by this chapter. The subdivider shall notify the designated engineer, and the public works director of the need for inspection as the improvements are constructed and installed. In no case shall the subdivider continue the installation of improvements and construction, if such action would pre-empt inspection by covering improvements before their approval by the public works director or designated engineer. Upon completion of all improvements, the public works director or the designated engineer shall inspect the completed improvements and verify the fact that they have been built to city specifications and standards, and in accordance with the preliminary plat.
(Code 1977, § 7-2005, as amended by Ord. No. 86-06, 8/26/86; Ord. No. 99-05, § 1(D), 2-9-99; Ord. No. 2014-03 , 5-27-14)

Because of the legal consideration here, this certificate should be approved as to form by the city attorney.
1.
Acceptance of streets, roadways, and drainage systems. The developer will provide a statement on the final plat that certifies that all streets, curbing, shoulders, and drainage systems will be maintained by the developer for a period of 24 months. The costs of providing these maintenance services will be the developer's responsibility for the two-year period that begins on the date the final plat is accepted by the mayor and council.

Occupancy permit required.
(1)
It shall be unlawful for any person, owner or agent thereof to occupy or use, or to permit the occupancy or use of any premises for any purpose, including the movement of furniture, equipment or other personal property into said premises, until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the fire official. The certificate so issued shall state that occupancy complies with all of the provisions of this code as far as can be determined by a visual inspection of the premises and a review of the records.
(2)
There shall be imposed by the city a charge of $50.00 for each application. In addition, there may be imposed by the city additional fees as determined by the applicable inspector.
(b)
Application, residential. It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly make any false statement on an application for an occupancy permit for a dwelling unit as to the names, relationships, ages or number of occupants who will occupy the dwelling unit.
(c)
Application, other than residential. It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly make any false statement on an application for an occupancy permit for a nonresidential unit as to the name of the person, firm, company or institution which will occupy the premises, the type of use, the type or quantity of materials that will be stored on the premises or the floor area of the portion of the premises that will be occupied.
(d)
Action on an application. The fire official shall examine or cause to be examined all applications for permits within a reasonable time after filing. No action shall be taken to issue a permit until an inspection of the premises is completed unless there is a current city-conducted property maintenance inspection report on file with the city.
(e)
Issuance of permit. If all fees are paid and the fire official is satisfied that the premises and its occupancy are in compliance with this code and all laws and ordinances applicable thereto, the fire official shall issue the occupancy permit as soon as practicable. No permit shall be issued under the provisions of this code for premises which have been newly constructed, newly altered, or on which a change in use is proposed unless a certificate of use and occupancy has first been issued under the provisions of the building code.
(f)
Conditional permit. Occupancy may be permitted on a conditional basis when in the judgment of the fire official practical difficulties interfere with completing all repairs required to bring the premises into full compliance with this code prior to permitting occupancy. However, no conditional permit shall be issued when there is a condition on the premises which can threaten the health or safety of an occupant. No conditional permit shall be issued under the provisions of this code for premises which have been newly constructed, newly altered or on which a change in use is proposed unless a certificate of use and occupancy has first been issued under the provisions of the building code.
(g)
Rejection of application. If the application does not comply with the requirements of all pertinent laws, the fire officials shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor.
(h)
Suspension of permit. Any permit issued shall become invalid if the occupancy is not commenced within six months after the issuance of the permit or if the occupancy is terminated.
(i)
Revocation of permit. The fire official may revoke a permit in case of any false statement or misrepresentation of facts in the application on which a permit was based, or in the event a structure or part thereof is condemned pursuant to this code.
(j)
Existing residential occupancies. The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to any residential occupancy in existence prior to February 9, 1999, unless there is a change in the occupancy of any person after said date.
(k)
In multifamily residential developments, a 60 percent change in tenants, after the first four years of initial construction, shall cause said developments to be required to update to the current residential construction and development standards. By no later than February 15 of each year, the owner and/or manager of multifamily residential developments shall file an affidavit with the zoning administrator stating the percentage of the change of tenants for the preceding calendar year.

Sec. 8-6-10. - General requirements for streets and other rights-of-way.
(a)
Existing streets shall be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width indicated in the Morrow Thoroughfare Plan.
(b)
Street names shall require the approval of the planning and zoning board. Streets that are obviously in alignment with streets already existing and named shall be given the name of the existing street. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or closely approximate those of existing streets.
(c)
Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be permitted.
(d)
Except where topographic or other conditions make a greater length unavoidable, cul-de-sacs, or dead-end streets, shall not be greater in length than 800 feet. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a property line radius of at least 50 feet with an outside pavement radius of at least 40 feet.
(e)
Where a subdivision abuts or contains a major street, a limited-access highway, or a railroad right-of-way, the planning and zoning board may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of the right-of-way either as a marginal access street or, at a distance suitable for an appropriate use of the intervening land, with a non-access reservation suitably planted. Due regard should be given requirements for approach grades and future grade separations in determining distances. Lots shall have no access to a major street (or limited access highway), but only to access streets.
(f)
Alleys may be required at the rear of all lots used for multi-family, commercial, or industrial developments but shall not be provided in one-family and two-family residential developments unless the subdivider provides evidence satisfactory to the planning and zoning board of the need for alleys.
(g)
High back curbs and gutters shall be installed on both sides of all streets.
(h)
Reserve strips controlling access to streets, alleys, and public grounds shall not be permitted unless their control is placed in the hands of the mayor and council, under conditions approved by the mayor and council.

Construction methods.
a.
Preparation of subgrade. All boulders, organic material, soft clay, spongy material and any other objectionable material shall be removed and replaced with approved material. The subgrade shall be properly shaped, rolled and uniformly compacted to conform with the lines, grades and typical cross-section as shown on the drawings approved by the city.
b.
Placing and rolling aggregate: All base course material shall be deposited and spread by means of spreader boxes, or approved mechanical equipment, or from moving vehicles equipped to distribute the material in a uniform layer. Each layer shall not be more than three inches in thickness after compaction and shall be constructed as follows:
1.
Immediately following the spreading of the coarse aggregate all material placed shall be compacted to the full width by rolling with a smooth wheel power roller weighing seven to ten tons. Rolling shall progress gradually from the sides to the center, parallel with the centerline of the street and lapping uniformly each preceding track by one-half (½) the width of that track, and shall continue until all the surface has been thoroughly keyed, the interstices of the stone reduced to a minimum, and until it ceases to creep or wave ahead of the roller.
2.
Any irregularities or depressions that develop under such rolling shall be corrected by loosening the material at these places and adding or removing material until the surface is smooth and uniform.
3.
After the coarse aggregate has been thoroughly keyed and set by the rolling described above, screenings in an amount that will completely fill the interstices shall be applied gradually over the surface and rolling shall be continued while the screenings are being spread, so that the jarring effects of the roller will cause the screenings to settle into the voids of the coarse aggregate.
4.
The screening shall not be dumped in piles on the coarse aggregate but shall be spread in thin layers, either by spreading motion with hand shovels, by mechanical spreading or directly from trucks. In no case shall the screenings be applied so fast or thickly as to cake or bridge on the surface in such manner as to prevent the filing of all voids or prevent the direct bearing of the roller on the coarse aggregate.
5.
Hand brooms shall be used to sweep the screenings into unfilled voids and to distribute the stone where needed. The spreadings, sweepings and rolling shall continue until no other screenings can be forced into the void.
6.
Shaping and rolling shall be performed alternately as required to maintain a uniform compacted base until a surface or treatment has been applied to the base.
7.
Along curbs, headers, and walls and at all places not accessible to the roller, the base course material shall be tamped thoroughly with mechanical tampers or approved hand tampers.
c.
Seasonal limits: No base material shall be deposited or shaped when the subgrade is frozen or thawing or during unfavorable weather conditions.
(e)
Reserved.
(f)
Bituminous prime.
(1)
Description. This item consists of the application of bituminous prime on a previously prepared base course. It includes cleaning of the surface to be primed.
(2)
Materials. The type of bituminous material used shall be cut-back asphalt, tar, or cut-back asphalt emulsion. The grade and amount of material used will depend on the surface texture and condition of the base and weather variations.
(3)
Weather limitations. Bituminous prime shall not be placed on any day when the temperature of the air at 7:00 a.m. is below 40 degrees F., nor when the temperature of the air is below 60 degrees F. in the shade, except that if cut-back asphalt emulsion is used, it shall not be applied when the temperature of the air is less than 50 degrees F. in the shade. Prime shall not be applied when rain threatens.
(4)
Condition of surface. The base to which the prime is to be applied shall have been finished to the approved line, grade and cross-section. The base shall be compact and bonded, and shall not show any deformation after the times of the distributor have passed.
a.
Cleaning: All loose material, dust, caked clay and all other material likely to prevent bonding of the prime with the base shall be swept and blown from the street for the full width of the prime and two feet more on each side, with mechanical sweepers and blowers and where necessary, by hand.
b.
Moisture: The surface of the base shall be only slightly damp. If it is too wet, it shall be allowed to dry. If it is too dry, it may be sprinkled lightly, just before it is primed.
(5)
Amount and extent of prime. The exact amount of bituminous material to be used will be from 0.10 to 0.30 gallons per square yard, depending on the nature and condition of the surface and the prime shall be applied to the full width of the proposed wearing surface of the street.
(6)
Heating and applying bituminous prime. The exact temperature for applying bituminous prime will be determined by the type of material used. In any case the temperature shall not be less than 80 degrees F. or more than 160 degrees F. regardless of type used.
(7)
Protection, curing and maintenance.
a.
Closing to traffic: The primed surface shall be closed to all traffic and left undisturbed for so long as necessary for the prime to cure and until it does not pick up under traffic.
b.
Rolling: If the base becomes soft after it is primed, the surface shall be rolled longitudinally with a pneumatic tired roller at not more than six miles per hour until the whole surface is firmly set.
c.
Sanding: If necessary to prevent the prime from being picked up, clean, dry, sharp sand shall be spread by hand or mechanically over the surface. Sand shall only be applied to places that are tacky, and the amount shall be the least needed to prevent picking up.
d.
Opening to traffic: After rolling and sanding (if it is required) have been done, the primed base may be opened to ordinary traffic. The primed surface shall be maintained until it is covered with a wearing surface.
(g)
One course bituminous plant mix surface course.
(1)
Description. This item shall consist of a wearing course of a compacted minimum thickness of one and one-half inches composed of aggregate and bituminous material mixed in a central plant, constructed on an approved type prepared base in accordance with these specifications and in conformity with the lines, grades and typical cross-sections as shown on the drawings approved by the city.

Mixing. Mixing shall be done in a suitable pug mill or continuous mixer. Minimum time of mixing shall be 35 seconds, and mixing shall be sufficient to coat all particles. The temperature of the materials when mixed shall be as follows:
a.
Aggregates—150 degrees to 325 degrees F. and never more than 25 degrees F. above temperature of bituminous material.
b.
Asphalt—225 degrees to 350 degrees F.
(4)
Construction methods.
a.
Cleaning and filling holes. Immediately before placing the bituminous mixture, the existing primed base shall be cleaned of loose or deleterious material by sweeping with a power broom or hand broom. Small depressions or pot holes are to be filled and thoroughly compacted to conform to the surrounding surface. If necessary, a tack coat of cut-back asphalt or asphalt cement of 0.03 to 0.12 gal. per square yard may be required.
b.
Spreading and finishing: The bituminous material shall be delivered on the job at a temperature between 225 degrees F. and 325 degrees F. and within 20 degrees F. of the temperature set at the mixing plant. Whenever practical the mixture shall be spread by mechanical spreaders. Only in inaccessible locations shall the mixture be spread by hand.
1.
Placing of the mixture shall be as continuous as possible and the roller shall pass over the unprotected edge of the fresh laid mixture only when the laying of the course is to be continued for such length of time as to permit the mixture to become chilled.
2.
Longitudinal and transverse joints shall be well bonded and seated. If necessary to obtain this result, the joints shall be cut back to the full depth of the previously laid course, painted with hot asphalt and heated. Before placing the mixture against them, all contact surfaces of curbs, gutters, headers, manholes, etc. shall be painted with a thin uniform coating of hot asphalt cement or cut-back asphalt.
3.
After spreading, the mixture shall be thoroughly and uniformly compacted by rolling with a seven to ten ton tandem roller as soon after being spread as it will bear the roller without undue displacement. Rolling shall start longitudinally at the sides and proceed toward the center of the pavement overlapping on successive trips by at least one-half the width of the rear wheel. Along curbs, headers, manholes and similar structures and at all places not accessible to the roller, thorough compaction must be secured by means of hot tampers, and at all contacts of this character the joints between these structures and the surface mixture must be effectively sealed. Rolling shall be continued until all creases have been removed and 92 percent to 98 percent density obtained.
c.
Seasonal limits: Bituminous mixture shall not be produced or placed during rainy weather, when the subgrade or base course is frozen or shows any evidence of excess moisture nor when the moisture on the surface to be paved would prevent proper bond, nor when the air temperature is less than 45 degrees F. in the shade away from artificial heat.
d.
Tolerances: The surface shall be true to the established grade. The thickness shall not vary more than one-fourth inch from that shown on the plan. The finished surface shall not vary more than one-fourth inch to 10 feet from the true profile and cross-section.

(b)
All signs must meet or exceed minimum reflectivity, standards of shape, size, color, legend size, and style as set forth in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).
(c)
Sign locations shall be reviewed by the public works director on the construction plans. Upon completion of construction, the developer must manufacture and install his own sign plates and posts to city specifications. This should be noted on the approved construction plans.
(d)
All traffic signage to be placed in the city right-of-way is to be made of retro-reflective sheeting, high intensity material or equivalent, and must meet the MUTCD standards. Plans should indicate the type of signage to be used. Plans should also indicate the approximate location and type of signage for each development.
(e)
Developer installed (custom signage). When the final plat is submitted, the public works director or his designee will inform the developer of the location and type of signage required. The developer must then install the signage to city specifications before the streets can be accepted by the city.
(f)
For residential developments, minimum traffic control devices shall consist of a street name sign at each intersection, a stop or yield sign at each intersection, one speed limit sign per block, school or pedestrian crossing signs where appropriate, and limited pavement markings such as cross walk lines for school or pedestrian crossings.

Sec. 8-6-17. - Pavement markings.
All pavement markings are to be in accordance with the MUTCD standards and shall meet the requirements of the standard details and the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Georgia Department of Transportation. The selection of pavement marking material to be used (i.e., paint, thermoplastic, preformed, etc.) shall be determined by the city and shall be indicated on the construction plans. All long lines (i.e., center, lane and edge lines) are to be five inches in width and the centerline should have a four-inch space between lines. Striped long lines (more than 150 linear feet) are to be applied by a highway type truck-mounted machine. All pavement markings are to be pre lined by the contractor and inspected by the city prior to the application of paint or thermoplastic.
(Ord. No. 99-05, § 1(S), 2-9-99)
Sec. 8-6-18. - Stormwater management and design.
(a)
Stormwater management plan meeting the criteria in the "Georgia Stormwater Management Manual". An effective stormwater management plan must be prepared for all developments. This plan should insure that adequate drainage facilities are provided for the site and that impact on downstream properties are minimized. The plan should be prepared under the direction of a registered professional engineer with a current license in Georgia. All plans and hydrology studies associated with drainage design must be stamped by the engineer. The plan should outline existing and proposed drainage conditions and downstream drainage receiving systems. A plan should be developed which minimizes downstream flooding and erosion impacts by evaluating pre developed versus post developed peak flows and velocities. For developments of five acres or more, a plan should be developed to minimize the impact of the development on stormwater quality. This can be achieved by minimizing impervious surfaces and/or the use of stormwater structural controls. The city requires all new development designs to utilize the "Wise" model to insure that runoff from the development meets the city's target for total suspended solids (TSS) loading. The "Wise" model can assist the design professional in the selection of the most efficient best management practices for achieving the TSS loading criteria.
(b)
Hydrologic methods. There are a variety of hydrologic methods which can be used to design stormwater management facilities. The following table lists the methods, which are generally accepted by the City of Morrow; if other methods are proposed, documentation must be provided that assures the method has been calibrated to local conditions and tested for accuracy and reliability. When designing stormwater storage devices, the impact on downstream properties or structures should be evaluated.

USGS 128 acres to 25 sq. miles For estimating hydrographs
HEC-1 >300 acres Can be used for peak flows and hydrographs, recommended for large basins
  1.
Design storm information. All drainage facilities should be designed for the 25-year storm. All culverts, open channels and storage facilities should be checked for 100-year storm conditions for emergency overflow facilities and flooding potential. Storage facilities should be checked to insure they will adequately detain the 2, 5, 10 and 25-year storms.
The rainfall intensities for the City of Morrow (Atlanta, Georgia) used for determining peak flows when utilizing methods such as the Rational Equation are found in the Weather Bureau Technical Paper No. 25. The 24-hour rainfall totals for different storm frequencies for the City of Morrow from U.S. Weather Bureau TP-40 are given below.
EXPAND
2-year storm 3.7 inches
5-year storm 4.8 inches
10-year storm 5.7 inches
25-year storm 6.6 inches
50-year storm 7.6 inches
100-year storm 7.9 inches
  (c)
Drainage design. Drainage systems should be designed to accommodate the 25-year peak discharge. Pipes and structures should be designed according to appropriate Georgia DOT standards.
(1)
Pipe systems. A drainage schedule or pipe chart will be required and should contain adequate information to assure that all drainage systems are properly identified, sized and located. Pipe charts should include the following information:
EXPAND
Pipe ID Structure type at each end of pipe
Drainage area Runoff coefficient
Time of concentration Rainfall intensity
Design discharge Pipe roughness coefficient
Pipe slope Inlet invert
Outlet invert Pipe length
Pipe diameter Head
Velocity Pipe gage
Pipe material Pipe coating
  The following criteria also apply to the design of drainage systems in residential subdivisions and any commercial system which connects to the city's right-of-way system.
a.
In residential subdivisions, stormwater pipes carrying water from the street must extend to a minimum of: 1) to within ten feet of the rear property line or vegetated buffer, if required; 2) 140 feet from the back of the curb; or 3) the 100-year floodplain boundary.
b.
All inlet and outlet points must contain concrete head wall or flared end sections.
c.
All discharge points are to have rip-rap for energy dissipation and for any discharge in excess of five fps. Velocity dissipaters should also be included in the design.
d.
Junction boxes are required where there are changes in direction, slope, size or material of pipes. All junction boxes should contain access covers (metal ring and cover) for maintenance purposes.
e.
Minimum pipe size in the city's right-of-way is 18 inches, except for residential driveway pipes, which may be 15 inches.
f.
Pipe systems should be designed to maintain a minimum velocity of three feet per second.
g.
Only reinforced concrete pipe (rcp) may be placed under the roadway pavement.
The following pipe types are accepted for use within the city right-of-way or as part of a system that connects to the city's right-of-way.
Type 1 bituminous coated corrugated metal pipe.
Reinforced concrete pipe.
Corrugated metal pipe with aluminized coating.
Polyethylene pipe, corrugated with smooth inside walls (not under road surface).
All pipes located outside the right-of-way must be contained in a drainage easement. The easement must be a minimum of 20 feet or two times the depth of the bottom of the pipe in feet. No permanent structure can be built in this easement.
(2)
Open drainage ditches. Open drainage ditches must be designed with maximum side slopes of 3:1 unless the slopes are stabilized with rock, then the maximum side slope may be 2:1. Velocities should be estimated for open channels to determine if additional stabilization is required. Open ditches located outside the right-of-way should be contained in a drainage easement at least 20 feet in width. The drainage easement should be wide enough to contain the ditch and side slopes.
(3)
Roadway drainage design. Only high-back curb and gutter are accepted in the city. Catch basins should be located no more than 400 feet apart or a distance that will allow no more than an eight-foot gutter spread from the face of the curb for 25-year peak flows. All other requirements are discussed above.
(d)
Stormwater storage facilities. Stormwater storage facilities are required if the hydrology study determines that detrimental downstream impacts will result after development without storage facilities. Detrimental downstream impacts could include flooding of existing stormwater structures, flooding of structural property, increased flooding of private property below the development site, increased stream bank erosion because of high velocity flows. The hydrology study should evaluate the downstream system to a point where the proposed developed area being studied is one-tenth of the overall watershed for the downstream system. The hydrology study should also consider the areas upstream of the point of analysis to be fully developed based on their current zoning classification.
If it is determined that storage is necessary, then the structure should be designed and built to insure that the post developed rate of runoff will not exceed the pre developed rate of runoff for storm frequencies of 2, 5, 10 and 25 years. The need for emergency overflow facilities for the 100-year storm should be evaluated.
The storage ponds should be designed with side slopes of 3:1 or flatter. The pond should be included in the landscaping plan for the development. Storage facilities with a maximum ponding depth of four feet or more must be enclosed behind a five-foot security fence. In residential developments, they should be contained within a drainage easement that extends 20 feet outside the 100-year ponding elevation and includes access to a public right-of-way.
The property owner must maintain ponds located on commercial property. Future inspections may be conducted by the city to insure the pond is being maintained to design conditions. An as-built certification prepared by a professional engineer must be submitted for each storage facility before the site can be accepted. Underground and parking lot storage facilities are also acceptable on commercial property. Underground facilities must include appropriate access structures for future maintenance and cleaning. Parking lot storage should not pond water deeper than two feet.
Centralized or regional detention may be approved for multiple sites provided that the facility is constructed and certified before a certificate of occupancy is issued for any development. Regional or centralized storage facilities should be contained in an easement similar to residential facilities.
(e)
Stormwater quality management. Development sites of five acres or greater must provide a plan for minimizing the discharge of pollutants in stormwater runoff. This can be achieved by minimizing the amount of impervious surfaces directly connected to drainage systems, by utilizing structural controls or a combination of both.
Structural controls can be multipurpose facilities, which provide both water quantity and water quality benefits and even recreational opportunities. Structural controls for water quality control should not be used as temporary sediment basins during construction because this can damage their efficiency by clogging filtering devices with silt. When limiting impervious surface percentages to avoid the need for structural controls, deed restrictions will be required to insure these areas are not developed later without stormwater quality structural controls. Structures built on commercial properties are required to maintain these controls and are subject to future inspections by city personnel.
For more information regarding the design of stormwater quality structural controls, refer to the Clayton County Stormwater Management Design Manual.

  (2)
Commercial/industrial developments.
EXPAND
Impervious surfaces > 70% Treat 1 st .5 inch of runoff from developed areas
Impervious surfaces of 40—70% Treat 1 st .5 inch
or
Maintain 50-foot undisturbed buffers along streams and major drainage ways, and velocity dissipation devices utilized to slow velocities from pipes or curb outlets to < 4 fps
Impervious surfaces < 40% No structural controls required;
Velocity dissipation for flows in excess of 4 fps; maintain 25 ft. undisturbed buffer on all perennial streams
  Note: Only runoff from developed areas must be treated. It may be necessary to separate runoff from these developed areas from other runoff and water from off-site to minimize the size of structural controls.
(f)
Several federal and state water quality programs require that local governments take the initiative to control water quality conditions in their local streams, rivers, and lakes. The streams and rivers in the city also serve as our source of drinking water. The city, in coordination with Clayton County and the Clayton County water authority, has conducted detailed assessments of water quality conditions of our streams and rivers and identified how these conditions will change in the future. In order to meet the goals of federal and state water quality programs and to maintain the water quality of our drinking water supplies, a pollutant loading target was developed to control the runoff from new development. Other watershed management programs are aimed at correcting problems in areas of existing development. Total suspended solids (TSS) runoff is the parameter used to evaluate new developments. Total suspended solids is a good indicator of most other pollutants because they usually are attached to the soil particles that are suspended in the runoff during rain events. The pollutant loading target for the city for TSS is 65 lbs./per acre/year.
The city requires all new development designs to utilize the "Wise" model to insure that runoff from the development meets the city's target for total suspended solids (TSS) loading. The "Wise" model can assist the design professional in the selection of the most efficient best management practices for achieving the TSS loading criteria. The "Wise" model is a simple spreadsheet tool that calculates TSS loadings based on proposed land use for the development site. The model can demonstrate the value of minimizing impervious and disturbed areas by reducing the need for structural stormwater controls. The model and guidance can be downloaded free of charge from the city web site, www.cityofmorrow.com, departments, public works.
Once it has been determined what kind, if any, of structural controls will be required to meet the TSS loading criteria, the designer should refer to the Georgia Stormwater Design Manual for guidance on designing these structures.

c.
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
(2)
Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
a.
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this section, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this section, and the public works director finds and determines that the requirements of this section prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the planning and zoning board and the mayor and council of the city may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
b.
Except as provided above, the mayor and council of the city shall grant no variance from any provision of this section without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the mayor and council. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within Clayton County. The public works director shall post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
1.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this section prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
2.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in this section would create an extreme hardship.
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this section, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
c.
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
1.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
2.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
3.
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
4.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
5.
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
6.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
7.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and,
8.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
d.
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
1.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
2.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
3.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and,
4.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
5.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance;
6.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.
(e)
Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements. This section is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this section should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this section imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
(f)
Additional information requirements for development on buffer zone properties. Any permit applications for property requiring buffers and setbacks hereunder must include the following:

All buffer and setback areas must be recorded on the final plat of the property following plan approval.
(g)
Responsibility. Neither the issuance of a development permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the provisions of this section shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon the city its officers or employees, for injury or damage to persons or property.
(h)
Inspection. The city may cause inspections of the work in the buffer or setback to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work. The permittee shall assist the city in making such inspections. The city shall have the authority to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this section, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land development activities within the protection area.
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out official duties.
(i)
Violations, enforcement, and penalties. Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this section or the requirements of an approved site plan or permit may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section. Any such action or inaction which is continuous with respect to time is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief.
