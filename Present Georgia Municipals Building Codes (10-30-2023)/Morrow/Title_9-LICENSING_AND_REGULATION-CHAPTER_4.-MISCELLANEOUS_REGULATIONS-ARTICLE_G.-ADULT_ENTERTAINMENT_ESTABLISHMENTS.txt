Editor's note— Ord. No. 2006-11, adopted Nov. 28, 2006, repealed the former Art. G, §§ 9-4-123—9-4-154, and enacted a new Art. G, §§ 9-4-123—9-4-152, as set out herein. The former Art. G pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 93-13, § 1, adopted Dec. 28, 1993; Ord. No. 94-15, § 1.H, adopted Dec. 13, 1994; Ord. No. 2003-08, § 1C, adopted July 22, 2003.

Sec. 9-4-123. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
The City of Morrow engaged in considerable fact-finding with respect to the secondary effects of adult entertainment in 1991 prior to adoption of restrictions on adult entertainment and the serving of alcoholic beverages. At that time, the city relied on the experiences of other urban counties and cities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta, Fulton County, DeKalb County and Richmond County, Georgia, College Park and Smyrna, Georgia, and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida. The city took note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which does not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within this country.
(b)
In preparing the revision of this article, the city has reengaged in that study and has examined studies from numerous other jurisdictions, including Austin, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Pinellas County, Florida; and a Minnesota Attorney General's Report of 1989 concerning regulation of sexually oriented businesses. It also, in public hearing, heard testimony from Major Thomas Kuzniacke of the College Park Police Department of an undercover operation conducted by that department, and from Morrow's Chief of Police Jeff Baker concerning research he had done involving adult entertainment in New Jersey, Austin, Texas, Beaumont, Texas, Minnesota and Indianapolis, Indiana. Chief Baker additionally provided information on Roswell's zoning ordinance, information about the number of schools located throughout Morrow, and the incompatibility of adult entertainment with residential neighborhoods, particularly the tendency of nearby neighborhoods to transition to less stable renter based areas following establishment of nearby adult uses.
(c)
With respect to live entertainment, the potential of adult entertainment establishments to serve as the source of connection between parties for various criminal offenses of a sexual nature has long been recognized. Because both parties to such activity frequently are consenting, crime statistics do not fully bear out the extent of criminal activity existing within such establishments and occurring off-site but originating through contact within such establishments. Studies bear out a correlation between the amount of clothing removed and aggression. Similarly, non-live adult venues pose health risks and can serve as a contact point for patrons making themselves available to one another, resulting in fluids deposited on the floors and walls. In some such establishments condoms are provided or may be purchased at the door.
(d)
The purpose of this article is to regulate adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and their resultant health risks will be curtailed. The preservation of stable residential areas and attractive vibrant commercial activity is a further goal of this ordinance. However, it is recognized that regulation of adult entertainment venues cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
