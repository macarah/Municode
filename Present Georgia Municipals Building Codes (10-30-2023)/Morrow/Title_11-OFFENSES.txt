The commercial properties in Morrow, and our business residents, are critical to the health of the city and we are committed to creating and maintaining the best environment for their success and sustainability. Commercial properties heavily impact the quality of life for residents, shoppers, and visitors, and continuously shape how we are perceived, our economic development efforts, and how we provide services. In order to promote a quality of life that enhances every aspect of our community, those big and small businesses along the larger commercial corridors, and those neighborhood businesses nestled within and around our residential neighborhoods, must adhere to the standards set forth in this Code. It shall be unlawful for any business to fail to maintain conditions which set a standard of quality for conducting business inside the City of Morrow. These conditions include, but are not limited to maintaining standards which promote cleanliness, beauty, safety, and success for any subject property and their commercial and residential neighbors.

Loitering shall mean remaining idle in essentially one location and shall include the concepts of spending time idly, loafing, walking about aimlessly, or sitting on cars, trucks, or other vehicles, and shall also include the colloquial expression "hanging around."

(4)
Obstruct, molest, or interfere with any person lawfully in any public place; or
(5)
Be at a place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances which would warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property within the vicinity. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this subsection, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this subsection if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.
(b)
Relocating from one position to another and regrouping or generally "hanging around" shall be "prima facie" evidence of intent to continue an unlawful act under this section and shall constitute a new offense after having been dispersed or cited for an offense under these provisions.
(c)
Loitering and prowling among parked vehicles.
(1)
It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter or prowl on any property upon which there are parked vehicles. It shall be evidence of an accused person's intention to violate this subsection if said person has been observed:

Tampering with the vehicle of another, which shall mean any unauthorized interference with the vehicle or any part or accessory thereof or the contents therein;

h.
Otherwise acting in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.
(2)
Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer; manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object that may be utilized for entry into an automobile or is otherwise prohibited by law; removes or attempts to remove anything of value from the vehicle; refuses to identify himself; or otherwise causes damage to the vehicle.
(3)
Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to issuing any citation or effectuating any arrest for an offense under this subsection, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this subsection if the Law Enforcement Officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

(Ord. No. 2000-12, § 1, 9-26-00)
Sec. 11-1-31. - Smoke-free Air Act of 2006.
(a)
[Purpose and intent.] Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to 65,000 Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999.)
The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health Information Service (EHIS), "Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Public Health Service, National Toxicology Program, 2000.)A study of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction in Helena, Montana before, during, and after a local law eliminating smoking in workplaces and public places was in effect, has determined that laws to enforce smoke-free workplaces and public places may be associated with a reduction in morbidity from heart disease. (Sergeant, Richard P.; Shepard, Robert M.; Glantz, Stanton A., "Reduced incidence of admissions for myocardial infarction associated with public smoking ban: before and after study," British Medical Journal 328: 977-980, April 24, 2004.) Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer. (California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke", Tobacco Control 6(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997.)
Accordingly, the Morrow City Council finds and declares that the purposes of this section are:
(1)
To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; and
(2)
To guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.
(b)
