(a)
Approval of alterations to historic properties.

If, in the opinion of the historic preservation commission, any such structure, building, object or work of art would fail to comply with the guidelines and would be inconsistent with the character of the historic property, the certificate of appropriateness shall be denied. Reasons for denial shall be stated and transmitted to the applicant in writing.

In making this determination, the historic preservation commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture, and materials of the architectural feature involved, and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style, and pertinent features of the other structures, buildings, objects, or works of art in the immediate neighborhood in accordance with the adopted design guidelines.

(e)
Public hearing on applications for certificates of appropriateness, notices, and right to be heard. At least seven (7) days prior to review of a certificate of appropriateness the historic preservation commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected by reason of the application and shall give applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. Notice in Walker County's legal organ or newspaper of general circulation within the county shall, for the purpose of this section, be deemed to be sufficient action.

(2)
In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure, building, object or work of art which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the historic preservation commission shall be binding upon the building official or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued.
(j)
Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the historic preservation commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to such provisions, or to interpret the meaning of such provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications, or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of such provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity, or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the historic preservation commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgement, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter.
