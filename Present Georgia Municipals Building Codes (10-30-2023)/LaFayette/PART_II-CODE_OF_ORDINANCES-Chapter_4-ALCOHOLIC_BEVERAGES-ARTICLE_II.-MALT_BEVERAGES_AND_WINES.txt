(2)
This section shall not be construed to include employees whose duties are limited solely to those of busboy(s), cooks, or dishwashers.
(3)
No permit shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the city clerk or designee and upon payment of a fee in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) and a search of the criminal record of the applicant completed. The application shall include, but shall be limited to, the name, date of birth and prior arrest record of the person, though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only, and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of the arrest information, the application shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order.
(4)
The city clerk or a designee shall have a complete and exhaustive search made relative to any criminal record of the person fingerprinted. If the person is eligible for employment, the city clerk or a designee shall issue a permit to the person, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the director of public safety or city code enforcement officer or other designee shall notify the person, in writing, that he or she is not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial and his or her right of appeal.
(5)
No person shall be granted a pouring permit unless it appears to the satisfaction of the city clerk or a designee that such person has not been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal sale or possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to a minor in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexually related crime within a period of five (5) years preceding the date of the application and is not on probation or parole. A person's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a city or county ordinance shall not, by itself, make a person ineligible for an alcohol pouring permit. No person shall be granted a pouring permit who has been convicted, plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state, or local law for any felony within five (5) years preceding the date of the application and is currently on probation or parole. For purposes of this division, a conviction or pleas of guilt or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which a person whose sentence was entered under the Georgia First Offender Act, as amended. Except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored if the person violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the person had previously been sentenced as a first offender.
(6)
An alcohol pouring permit shall be issued for a period of three (3) calendar years from the date of the application. As provided in subsection (11) of this section, the alcohol pouring permit must be in the possession of the employee while the employee is working at the licensed establishment and available for inspection by members of the city police department. After application of the pouring permit is completed with the city, the employee may immediately commence work on a temporary basis provided the employee retains the receipt for the permit on his or her person at all times at the premises for which the alcohol license has been issued, and thereafter, if a permit is issued, must maintain on his or her person at the premises the actual pouring permit. If a permit is not issued, the employee must immediately cease work upon being notified that a permit will not be issued to the employee.
(7)
No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed or covered up any material fact by any device, trick or scheme while making application to the city clerk for an alcohol beverage pouring permit under this section. If it is determined that a person is in violation of this subsection and a permit is denied for this reason, then ninety (90) calendar days must elapse from the date of notification of the denial of the permit before the person may submit a new application for a permit.
(8)
All permits issued through administrative error can be immediately terminated and seized by the city clerk or designee.
(9)
Replacement permits will be issued within thirty (30) days of original date, upon paying one-half of the fee charged for alcohol pouring permits. After thirty (30) days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted.
(10)
All permits issued under this division remain the property of the city and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any city police officer, city code enforcement officer, city clerk or a designee.
(11)
No licensee shall allow any employee or manager required to hold a permit to work on premises unless the employee or manager has in his or her possession a current valid city pouring permit. For new employees, a receipt issued by the city clerk may be used for a maximum of ninety (90) days from the date of its issue unless notified that a permit will not be issued. Licensees are required by this division to inspect and verify that each employee required to do so has in his or her possession a valid current alcohol pouring permit.
(12)
