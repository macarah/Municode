ARTICLE XI. - APPEAL PROCEDURE
This article is established to identify the procedure whereby any aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the zoning administrator.

Sec. 11-1. - Who may appeal.
Any party aggrieved because of the alleged error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator may appeal such action to the planning commission. Such appeal shall be filed no later than 45 days after the date of the decision appealed by filing with the zoning administrator and with the planning commission, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The zoning administrator shall forthwith transmit to the planning commission all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
Sec. 11-2. - Decision by planning commission.
The planning commission may, in conformity with the provisions of these regulations, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination of the zoning administrator and to that end shall have all the powers of the zoning administrator.
Sec. 11-3. - Appeal of decision by planning commission.
Any party aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission, including members of the planning commission or city council, may seek review of such decision by filing an appeal within 30 days of the decision with the clerk to the city council. The city council should review the record submitted to the planning commission and the zoning administrator, and make its decision on those grounds. The decision of the city council to affirm or reverse may be appealed to superior court by seeking the writ of mandamus within 30 days of its decision, otherwise it is final.
