(a)
The city council shall be presided over at its meetings by the mayor or, in his or her absence, by the mayor pro tempore. Three councilmembers shall constitute a quorum and shall be authorized to transact the business of the council. In the event vacancies in office result in less than a quorum of councilmembers holding office, then the remaining councilmembers in office shall constitute a quorum and shall be authorized to transact the business of the city council. A vote of a majority of the remaining councilmembers shall be required for the adoption of any ordinance, resolution, or motion. The council shall cause to be kept in a well-bound book an accurate record of all its proceedings, bylaws, acts, orders, ordinances, and resolutions, which book shall be fully indexed and open to the public.

(d)
Special meetings of the city council may be held on call of the mayor or a majority of members of the city council. Notice of such special meetings shall be served on all other members personally, or by telephone personally, at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting. Such notice to councilmembers shall not be required of the mayor and all councilmembers who are present when the special meeting is called. Such notice of any special meeting may be waived by a councilmember or mayor in writing before or after such a meeting, and attendance at the meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice on any business transacted in such councilmember's or mayor's presence. Only the business stated in the call may be transacted at the special meeting.

All meetings of the city council shall be public to the extent required by law and notice to the public of special meetings shall be made [as] fully as is reasonably possible 24 hours prior to such meetings.

Where a meeting of the council is devoted in part to matters within the authorized exceptions to public access requirements, any portion of the meeting not subject to any such exceptions shall be open to the public. No executive session shall be held except pursuant to a majority affirmative vote of the city council taken in a public meeting. The minutes of the public meeting shall reflect the names of councilmembers present, those voting for the executive session, and the specific reasons for the executive session. Minutes of the executive session may be maintained by the clerk of the city council upon a majority vote of the council. Any such minutes shall be maintained in a confidential file and shall not be subject to disclosure, except that disclosures of such portions of minutes identifying real estate to be acquired by the council may only be delayed until such time as the acquisition of the real estate has been completed, terminated, or abandoned or court proceedings have been initiated.
(g)
All councilmembers except the mayor shall have one vote each. As noted in section 2-10 of this Charter, the mayor shall have one vote if and only if there is a tie in the votes of the other councilmembers.
(h)
The city council may have posted any measure, ordinance, or resolution at such place in the city as it may direct for the information of the public, or it may have the same published in any newspaper of the city, but failure to so post or publish any ordinance, measure, or resolution shall in no way operate to render the same void.
Sec. 2-9. - Committees.

Sec. 2-14. - Rules of procedure.
(a)
Main motion. In order for the council to take any official action on any subject, a councilmember must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the mayor until another councilmember agrees to second the motion. This section does not require the councilmember seconding the motion to support the motion. A councilmember may withdraw a main motion that he or she has made at any time before the council has voted on the motion.
(b)
Debate. After the main motion is recognized by the mayor, the council shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the mayor in a manner that is fair to all members of the council. During the course of the debate, councilmembers may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the council take a particular action on a motion, i.e., to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Motions to recess and adjourn require a second.
(c)
Voting procedure. Voting on motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
If debate has been completed and no other councilmember wishes to speak, the mayor can call for the vote. If there are no objections, then the mayor can proceed with the vote; and
(2)
If the mayor calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the council may move to vote immediately. If this motion is seconded and approved by a two-thirds vote, debate will stop. The mayor will then read the proposed motion to the council and ask for the votes of the councilmembers.
Sec. 2-15. - Ordinance form; procedures.
(a)
All ordinances passed which amend, repeal, or in any way affect the Code must be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of the Code and printed for inclusion therein. In the case of repealed chapters, sections, and subsections or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed are omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima-facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that the Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code by the city council.
(b)
Amendments to any of the provisions of the Code may be made by amending such provision by specific reference to the section number of the Code in the following language: "Section _______ of the Code of Ordinances, City of Brooklet, Georgia, is hereby amended to read as follows: …." The new section shall then be set out in full as desired.

If a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added, the following language may be used:

The new section may then be set out in full as desired.

All sections, articles, chapters, or provisions desired to be repealed should be specifically repealed by section, article, or chapter number, as the case may be.

An ordinance may be introduced by any councilmember and be read at a regular or special meeting of the city council.

Acts of the city council which have the force and effect of law shall be enacted by ordinance.
Sec. 2-17. - Emergencies.
To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property, or public peace, the city council may convene on call of the mayor or three councilmembers and promptly adopt an emergency ordinance, but such ordinance may not levy taxes; grant, renew, or extend a franchise; regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services; or authorize the borrowing of money except for loans to be repaid within 30 days. An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists, and describing the emergency in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted, with or without amendment, or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least three councilmembers shall be required for adoption. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify. Every emergency ordinance shall automatically stand repealed 30 days following the date upon which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency still exists. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances.

This compilation shall be known and cited officially as the "The Code of the City of Brooklet, Georgia." Copies of the Code shall be furnished to all officers, departments, and agencies of the city and may be made available for purchase by the public at a reasonable price as fixed by the city council.
