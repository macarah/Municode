Notwithstanding, in a case involving a site utilizing its own private water supply and distribution system to multiple locations resulting in the production of domestic-type waste water only, such as employee restrooms and showers, such that reading and maintenance of meters would create excessive costs and hardship in the judgement of the director, the city may bill on flow estimates calculated on the basis of an average flow per employee times the average number of employees at such facility for the recovery of costs of transporting and treating the wastewater.
Adjustments in Billing:
The city does not make adjustments for water leaks.
