--- (8) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2006-02, adopted March 13, 2006, set out provisions intended for use as Art. V, §§ 34-250—34-261. Inasmuch as there were already provisions so designated, these provisions have been redesignated as Art. IX, §§ 34-361—34-372, at the direction of the city.

Sec. 34-361. - Findings.
The Jonesboro City Council makes the following findings:
(1)
Stormwater management is needed throughout the City of Jonesboro. While specific service and system demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the City of Jonesboro is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(2)
Addressing the stormwater management needs in the City of Jonesboro is essential to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and systems results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the City of Jonesboro in a variety of ways.
(3)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff can result in flooding, streambank and ditch erosion, property damage and degradation of water quality, aquatic habitat and biological communities. Failure to manage these impacts can put the City of Jonesboro's ability to receive state and federal grants and permits at risk.
(4)
The volume and quantity of stormwater generated by a development has been proven to be most closely associated with the amount of impervious surface on the property, therefore, the square footage of impervious surface is the most appropriate factor for calculating stormwater utility fees.
(5)
Clayton County, Forest Park, Jonesboro, Lake City, Lovejoy, Morrow, and Riverdale, presently own and operate stormwater management systems which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by these entities, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the entities to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems in the City of Jonesboro in concert with the management of other water resources in the county. In order to do so, there must be adequate and stable funding for the City of Jonesboro's stormwater management program's operating needs and capital.
(6)
The feasibility report submitted to the county, cities, and Clayton County Water Authority (CCWA) properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the stormwater utility.
(7)
As a result, the county's governing authority finds that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering storm water management services and the county's governing authority finds that a utility fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding storm water management services in the City of Jonesboro.
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 34-250, 3-13-2006)
Sec. 34-362. - Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply to this article. Any word or phrase not defined below but otherwise defined in this Code shall be given that meaning. All other words or phrases shall be given their common ordinary meaning unless the context clearly requires otherwise.
Credit shall mean a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. The basis of such credits, if granted, will be defined by a specific written agreement at the determination of the stormwater official in accordance with the stormwater utility.
Customer shall mean all persons or entities to whom the stormwater service charge is billed.
Detached dwelling unit shall mean developed land containing one structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar non-residential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties.
Developed land means real property which has been altered from its "natural" state by addition of any improvements, such as grading, paving, compaction, construction of structures or impervious surfaces greater than 200 square feet, or drainage works so that hydrologic response of the property is changed from that which would occur in the natural undeveloped conditions. For new construction, property shall be considered developed pursuant to this article upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or upon completion of construction or final inspection if no such certificate is issued.
Hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area; the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property; antecedent moisture conditions; and groundwater conditions on a property.
Impervious surfaces shall mean those areas, which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. The following types of surfaces will be considered "impervious surfaces" for purposes of the stormwater utility: the projected area of buildings; asphalt-, concrete-, brick-, or stone-paved areas; improved vehicular drives and parking areas; compacted gravel and soil surfaces; fabric or plastic coverings; and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff or that change the hydrologic response of the property that existed prior to development.
Multi-family residential shall mean developed land where more than one attached or detached residential dwelling units are located, including, but not limited to apartment houses, condominiums, townhomes, attached single-family homes, boarding houses, group homes, hotels and motels, retirement centers, and other structures in which more than one family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside.
Service charges shall mean the stormwater management service charges applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by CCWA stormwater utility. The charge shall be used to fund the City of Jonesboro stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and systems. Service charges are based on measurable parameters that influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced level of stormwater services above those normally provided by CCWA.
Single family residential shall mean a developed lot containing one dwelling structure with its principal use being residential.
Stormwater development guidelines are those guidelines established by CCWA which specify approved design criteria, construction materials and construction methods for components of the stormwater management system.
Stormwater management system means any one or more of the various devices used in the collection, treatment, or conveyance of storm, flood or surface drainage waters, including all manmade structures or natural watercourse for the conveyance or transportation of runoff, such as: detention areas, lakes, berms, swales, improved watercourses, open channels, streams, culverts, pipes, catch basins inlets; collection, or drainage.
Stormwater official is the CCWA General Manager or his/her appointee that has direct responsibility for the management of the CCWA stormwater utility.
Stormwater unit (SU) shall mean the unit of measure which provides the basis for comparing the runoff generated by customer's developed land with that generated by another's. A SU shall be the average impervious coverage of a statistical sampling of single-family residential lots in the City of Jonesboro. A stormwater unit has been determined through engineering and analysis to be 2,950 square feet of impervious surface. This unit will be used to determine and compute the service charge for all developed land served by the CCWA stormwater utility.
Stormwater utility guidebook shall mean the document that defines the basis for the stormwater utility, policies and procedures for operating the utility, and other necessary information determined to help document how the utility was developed and how it is operated.
Undeveloped land is land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures in excess of 200 square feet which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state.
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 34-251, 3-13-2006)
Sec. 34-363. - Establishment of a utility.
(a)
The City of Jonesboro hereby consents to the establishment of a county-wide stormwater utility (the "stormwater utility") by the CCWA which shall be responsible for stormwater management county-wide, and shall provide for, the management, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems. Specific areas of regulation and maintenance are established in the Stormwater Utility Guidebook so long as they are not in conflict with the terms of this article or that certain intergovernmental agreement dated, as amended from time to time, between CCWA and the City of Jonesboro.
(b)
Pursuant to the terms of this article and that certain intergovernmental agreement, as amended from time to time, between CCWA and the City of Jonesboro, the CCWA shall carry out and perform on behalf of the City of Jonesboro, all of the City of Jonesboro's duties and responsibilities with respect to stormwater management services, enforcement, and systems heretofore owned and operated by the city.
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 34-252, 3-13-2006)
Sec. 34-364. - Scope of responsibility for the stormwater utility.
(a)
The stormwater utility shall monitor the design, operation, maintenance, inspection, construction, and use of all stormwater management systems in the county. The stormwater utility shall be responsible for the design and construction of public stormwater facilities owned by the county and shall inspect, operate, and maintain them as prescribed herein. The stormwater utility shall provide services which relate to the:
•
Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the City of Jonesboro;
•
Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing city- or county-owned stormwater management systems;
•
Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs;
•
Maintenance and/or improvement of water quality in waterways throughout the City of Jonesboro.
•
Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems; and
•
Complying with the federal and state regulations related to stormwater management including the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (MNGWPD) watershed management requirements.
•
Education of the public regarding stormwater issues.
The stormwater utility shall not provide stormwater services related to Erosion and Sedimentation Control (E&SC).
(b)
The stormwater utility shall be responsible for plan approval and construction inspection of both private stormwater systems and public stormwater systems not owned by the county. Design and construction of public or private stormwater management facilities will be governed by the CCWA's Stormwater Development Guidelines which specify design criteria, construction materials and construction methods. The CCWA Stormwater Development Guidelines will supersede any previously adopted stormwater design or construction guidelines. Additionally, the stormwater utility may accept the responsibility for the operation and maintenance of private stormwater systems only when such services have been agreed to, contracted for, and approved by the governing authority of the utility.
(c)
The stormwater utility shall provide for inspection of private stormwater systems to ascertain that the stormwater systems are functioning as designed and approved. The MNGWPD post-development stormwater ordinance has been adopted by Clayton County, Forest Park, Jonesboro, Morrow, Lake City, Lovejoy, and Riverdale. Property owners who fail to maintain their stormwater systems will be notified of the violation. If within 30 days (or 24 hours if there is an immediate danger to public safety), no actions are taken, the CCWA may enter the property and correct the failure. The cost for the repair work may be a charge on the customer's water, sewer and stormwater bill or a lien on the property that may be placed on the tax bill.
(d)
The CCWA owns or has rights established by written agreements which allow it to operate, maintain, improve and access those stormwater management systems and facilities which are located:
(1)
Within public road rights-of-way and easements;
(2)
On public land which is owned by the county, cities, or other governmental entity, and to which CCWA has agreements for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management system;
(3)
Operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of stormwater management systems which are located on private or public property not owned by the county or cities, and for which there has been no written agreement granting easements, rights-of-entry, rights of-access, rights-of-use or other form of dedication thereof to CCWA for operation, maintenance, improvement and access of such stormwater management systems, shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as otherwise provided for by the laws of the state and the United States; and
(4)
It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the county or cities. CCWA has expressly reserved the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the CCWA, its directors, and employees arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship.
(e)
The stormwater utility shall provide for effective management of a uniform stormwater plan and program throughout the City of Jonesboro and provide compliance with the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer NPDES Permit issued to each jurisdiction including but not limited to the following components:
•
Public education and outreach on stormwater issues;
•
Public involvement and participation;
•
Illicit discharge detection and elimination;
•
Post-construction stormwater management;
•
Pollution prevention;
•
Floodplain management;
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 34-253, 3-13-2006)
Sec. 34-365. - Stormwater service charges authorized.
The CCWA is authorized to impose a service charge on each customer of the stormwater system, provided that such charge is closely associated with the amount of impervious surface associated with a particular property for which the service charge is imposed. The stormwater utility guidebook shall provide for the rate structure which shall determine overall charges for properties served by the stormwater utility, based in part on the number of stormwater units each property is determined to consist of. The stormwater service charge and rate structure may be amended from time to time by official action of the CCWA Board of Directors. The CCWA shall review the stormwater service charge and rate structure on an annual basis and any rate changes will be approved by the CCWA Board of Directors.
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 34-254, 3-13-2006)
Sec. 34-366. - Effective date of stormwater service charges.
The CCWA may begin collecting the stormwater service charge on or after September 1, 2006 and but shall bill more frequently than monthly thereafter.
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 34-255, 3-13-2006)
Sec. 34-367. - Exemptions.
The following properties are exempt from stormwater utility fees:
(1)
Undeveloped land;
(2)
All public road rights of way; and
(3)
Railroad rights of way (tracks). However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service charges.
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 34-256, 3-13-2006)
Sec. 34-368. - Credits.
(a)
To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to CCWAs standards by private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems.
(b)
Property owners of developed land may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The specific credits will be determined based on the guidelines in the stormwater utility guidebook. Credits for structural controls will be based on best management practices performance as defined by the design criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, First Edition, August 2001.
(c)
Credits may be partial or full credits and property owners can receive a maximum 40 percent credit.
(d)
Property owners seeking stormwater service charge credits must apply for stormwater service charge credits through completion and submittal to the CCWA of a stormwater service charge credit application.
(e)
Upon receipt of a completed application, the CCWA shall review the application and make a determination as to whether the applicable criteria for a credit have been met. All decisions regarding the approval or disapproval of a stormwater credit shall be made within 45 days of the date the completed application was received by CCWA.
(f)
Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on (1) continuing compliance with the CCWAs design and performance standards as may be updated or amended from time to time; and (2) upon continuing provision of the systems or facilities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The CCWA may revoke any credit at any time for non-compliance with this article.
(g)
Stormwater utility fees may be adjusted retroactively to the date that CCWA received the completed application.
(h)
Applicants receiving credit for a structural control as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual must have an approved maintenance plan on file with CCWA and the applicant's property must have on-site stormwater management and treatment facilities.
(i)
A customer shall reapply every five years for the credit granted, however, CCWA may terminate the credit if CCWA finds the facility does not comply with the original approved credit application.
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 34-257, 3-13-2006)
Sec. 34-369. - Inspection of private facilities.
Continuing compliance with the CCWA's design and performance standards may be verified by CCWA inspection of the systems or facilities upon which the credit is based. No credit shall be given under this article unless the property owner agrees in writing in its application that the CCWA shall have the right for its designated officers, representatives, agents, and employees to enter upon private and public property, upon reasonable notice to the owner of such property, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering testing, on such property in order to assure compliance with the design and performance standards and the applicant's credit application. On-site systems or facilities determined to no longer comply with the county's design and performance standards or the applicant's original credit application shall subject the property owner to revocation of all, or a portion of, stormwater service charge credits based on the CCWA inspectors' estimate of capacity reduction for a period of not less than one year.
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 34-258, 3-13-2006)
Sec. 34-370. - Stormwater service charge, billing, delinquencies and collections.
The CCWA is authorized to establish and/or utilize its own policies with respect to the billing and collection of the stormwater utility service charge and the treatment of delinquent accounts. The stormwater utility service charge may be billed separately, or on a customer statement and collected along with other utility services provided by CCWA, at the CCWA's sole discretion. The CCWA is authorized to apply partial payments proportionately among the water, sewer, and stormwater fees charged by the CCWA. The CCWA is authorized to use existing CCWA procedures for shutting off water with respect to non-payment.
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 34-259, 3-13-2006)
Sec. 34-371. - Stormwater utility enforcement.
(a)
Every owner of developed real property located in the City of Jonesboro, and every person who serves as a contractor or developer for the purpose of developing real property located in the City of Jonesboro shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, treat, control and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all City of Jonesboro ordinances and development regulations, and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America.
(b)
When the stormwater official determines that a public nuisance exists, the stormwater official shall send a notice of violation by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or owners of the property described, as their name and address are shown on the latest ad valorem tax records of the county property appraiser. This notice shall be deemed complete and sufficient when so addressed and deposited in the United States mail with proper postage prepaid. The notice of violation shall inform the property owner that a violation of this article exists on the identified property with the description of the public nuisance, that the property owner is responsible for maintaining the identified private storm water system, that the property owner may allow the city access to the property to abate the nuisance at the expense of the property owner, and that formal enforcement action will be taken if the violation is not corrected within the time period indicated on the notice. The stormwater official shall determine a reasonable period of time for correction of the nuisance. In determining a reasonable period of time, the stormwater official shall consider the following: practicality and ease of correction; the owner's ability to correct the violation; the severity of the violation; the nature, extent, and probability of danger to the public, and other relevant factors.
Notice, as required under this provision, shall not be required: (a) when the stormwater official determines that the public nuisance presents an imminent endangerment to persons or property; (b) when a notice of violation has been sent to the same property owner or owners for the same violation within the previous three months; or (c) when notice by certified mail cannot be effected on the owners of record.
The notice of violation shall contain substantially the following information and may be in the following form or other appropriate form: notice of violation: name of owner; address of owner; description of property; inspection date; determination made by the stormwater official that the condition on the property is creating adverse conditions so as to constitute a violation of the this article; describe the conditions that caused the property to be in violation and any recommended actions that may be necessary to remedy the nuisance; specify a reasonable time period to proceed and remedy the nuisance; or provide written permission to the city to enter the site and abate the nuisance at owner's expense. Within the reasonable period of time for compliance specified in the notice of violation, the property owner shall either abate the nuisance or file a written request with CCWA for a hearing before the stormwater official to show that the condition alleged in the notice does not exist or that such condition does not constitute a public nuisance in violation of the ordinance.
(c)
Any failure to meet the obligation set forth in this section shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by any damaged party or the City of Jonesboro in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the CCWA may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner or developer, if any, on a joint and several basis. From the date of the filing of such action, the CCWA shall have lien rights, which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the superior court or city court. CCWA shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the City of Jonesboro, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this section.
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 34-260, 3-13-2006)
Sec. 34-372. - Appeals.
(a)
Any customer who believes the provisions of this article have been applied in error may appeal in the following manner:
(1)
An appeal must be filed in writing with the stormwater official within 30 days of the decision that is appealed. In the case of service charge appeals, the appeal shall include a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer containing information on the, total property area, the impervious surface area, and any other features or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events.
(2)
The CCWA shall conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and respond to the appeal in writing within 30 days.
(3)
In response to an appeal the CCWA may adjust the stormwater service charge applicable to a property in conformance with the general purpose and intent of this article.
(4)
All decisions by the CCWA shall be final.
(b)
The appeal process contained in this section shall be a condition precedent to an aggrieved customer seeking judicial relief.
