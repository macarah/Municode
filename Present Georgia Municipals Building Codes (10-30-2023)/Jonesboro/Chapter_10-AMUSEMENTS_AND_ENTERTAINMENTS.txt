Sec. 10-31. - Purpose.
Based on city officials' own observations of establishments that exploit live human nudity and human sexuality for commercial profit, euphemistically referred to as adult entertainment, and the experiences of other urban cities and counties including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas; Manatee County, Florida; the State of Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Phoenix, Arizona, and as further described in City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000), which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the City of Jonesboro, Georgia, and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before the mayor and council, the mayor and council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of live human nudity and human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within the country.
Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that the commercial exploitation of live human nudity and human sexuality, in all the forms in which such exploitation may be manifested has deleterious effects on the community where it takes place and that such effects are intensified and exacerbated when adult entertainment is provided in conjunction with the service or consumption of alcohol. The mayor and council find that adult entertainment causes an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas, including, but not limited to, disorderly conduct, public intoxication, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. The mayor and council further find that adult entertainment establishments escalate undesirable community conditions, including blight, diminish property values, increase the need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources, and increase the burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described.
The mayor and council expressly find that the negative effects of adult entertainment are not limited to adult entertainment that offers live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts. Other forms of adult entertainment also have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in nearby neighborhoods and commercial districts and on urban life in general. Such other forms of adult entertainment include, but are not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters, massage parlors, bath houses, adult gift or novelty shops, and lingerie modeling studios.
Further, based on the investigation conducted by the city regarding lingerie modeling studios, it is the finding of the mayor and council that lingerie modeling studios are establishments that offer adult entertainment in the form of live human nudity in a private setting. Based on the evidence presented to the mayor and council, it is apparent that lingerie modeling studios, by providing adult entertainment in a private setting, lead to criminal behavior including, but not limited to, masturbation for hire, prostitution, and sodomy.
Furthermore, based on the investigation conducted by the city, it is apparent that lingerie modeling studios pose a more difficult challenge to the enforcement of regulations pertaining to adult entertainment business, in that the activity occurs within a private setting, as opposed to in an open area which is visible to all patrons of the establishment. For the same reason, the mayor and council have identified massage parlors as presenting similar risks of criminal behavior and problems of enforcement. The mayor and council have determined that lighting, visibility and access are measures that can reduce the risk of crime to patrons and others.
Accordingly, the mayor and council find that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to limit and regulate adult entertainment within the corporate boundaries of the city, so as to limit the adverse impact on property values, other business uses, residential uses and public and semi-public uses; to ensure that adult entertainment uses and adult entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; to restrict adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily-used public pedestrian areas and to protect patrons of adult entertainment business from unreasonable risk of crime.
After giving due consideration to the considerations stated in these findings and the current state of growth and development of the city, the mayor and council find that properties located within the city limits and abutting the right of way of Tara Boulevard are so situated as to provide sufficient vehicular access to patrons and suppliers, while providing the desired containment from residential uses and pedestrian traffic, regarding adult entertainment facilities and adult entertainment businesses.
This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally-protected forms of expression. This article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of providers and patrons of adult entertainment.
It is a matter of governmental interest and concern and in the interest of the public welfare to minimize the proliferation of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that commercially exploit human sexuality through adult entertainment to limit adult entertainment uses of property to certain prescribed areas of the city. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.
