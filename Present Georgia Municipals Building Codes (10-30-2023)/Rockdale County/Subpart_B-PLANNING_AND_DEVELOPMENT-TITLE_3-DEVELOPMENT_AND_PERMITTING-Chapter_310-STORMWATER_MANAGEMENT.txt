ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER UTILITY

Sec. 310-131. - Findings.
The county board of commissioners makes the following findings of fact:
(1)
Rockdale County is authorized by the State Constitution, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I(a) and III(a)(6) thereof and state law to provide stormwater management services throughout Rockdale County.
(2)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the government of Rockdale County hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility and establish rates for stormwater management services.
(3)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this Section, Rockdale County is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the Charter of Rockdale County to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. Ga. Const. art. IX, ยง II, ยถ III(a)(6).
(4)
Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may create environmental damage to the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and adjacent to Rockdale County.
(5)
A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within Rockdale County and surrounding areas.
(6)
The county presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the county, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the county to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the county in concert with the management of other water resources within the county. In order to do so, the county must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage related capital improvement needs.
(7)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the operations of sanitary sewer operated by Rockdale County by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system.
(8)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels of treatment requirements imposed on the county's wastewater treatment facilities and increased water treatment cost of potable water supplies.
(9)
Proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing and future development in Rockdale County. Rockdale County has several rivers and streams listed on the list of impaired waters produced by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, or other appropriate authorities pursuant to Section 303(d) of the Act.
(10)
The county is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. the county's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II Georgia Notice of Intent (NOI) and stormwater permit effective March 13, 2003] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the county to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature.
(11)
Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES permit will substantially increase the cost of stormwater management above that which is currently spent for water quality management, drainage and flood control.
(12)
The cost of operating and maintaining the county stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system.
(13)
The professional engineering and financing analysis, known as the stormwater utility implementation master plan, prepared by the county's consulting stormwater engineer, properly assesses and defines the county's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy.
(14)
Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the county in concert with other water resource management programs.
(15)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the unincorporated areas of the county. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the unincorporated areas of the county is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(16)
The stormwater needs in the county include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the county in a variety of ways as described in the stormwater utility implementation master plan.
(17)
The services and benefits rendered, or resulting from provision of stormwater management services, may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the county's stormwater management services which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof.
(18)
A stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the county, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services in the urban and suburban areas of the unincorporated portions of the county through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms as described in the stormwater utility implementation master plan prepared for the county.
(19)
A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the urban and suburban areas of the unincorporated area of the county. Such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the board of commissioners.
(20)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the county stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater manager. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property benefited by such systems.
(21)
The area of impervious surfaces on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the county or to be provided by the county in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge.
(22)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the county stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

Sec. 310-141. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments.
(a)
The property owner, as identified from public land records of Rockdale County, shall be obligated to pay the appropriate stormwater user fee charge for that property.
(1)
Billing. Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue October 1, 2005, and shall be billed prospectively. A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater user fee charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due.
(2)
The stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected through the current county property tax billing system, or through another method, as deemed most effective and efficient by the board of commissioners. If the board of commissioners elects to include the stormwater user fee charge on the county's property tax bill, the stormwater user fee charge shall be paid in full before any payment is applied toward the property tax bill.
(3)
Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by the board of commissioners.
(4)
Failure to receive a bill or receipt of an incorrect bill shall not be justification for nonpayment.
(5)
If a property is unbilled, if no bill is sent, or if the bill contains errors for a particular property, the Rockdale County Stormwater Utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not assess penalties or be entitled to any interest for any delinquency during the back billed period.
(b)
Delinquencies and collection.
(1)
Unpaid fees shall be collected in any manner permissible by Georgia law, including but not limited to: utilizing the services of a collection agency; by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account; or by enforcement of any lien resulting from a judgment. In no instance shall the unpaid fee constitute a direct lien against the property.
(2)
