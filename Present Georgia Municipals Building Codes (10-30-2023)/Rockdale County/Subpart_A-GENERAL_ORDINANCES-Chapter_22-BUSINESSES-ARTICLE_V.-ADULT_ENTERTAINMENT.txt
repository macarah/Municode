Sec. 22-141. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
It is the purpose and intent of this article to regulate adult entertainment establishments to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the county and to establish reasonable and uniform content-neutral regulations of adult entertainment establishments within the county, thereby reducing or eliminating the adverse secondary effects from such adult entertainment establishments. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor the effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor the effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. This article is not intended to interfere with or suppress legitimate expression or any speech activities protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or the state constitution nor is it intended to license any use or activity which is otherwise prohibited or made punishable by law.
(b)
The regulations that follow and that otherwise are contained in this Code regarding adult entertainment establishments constitute content-neutral requirements that have been carefully designed to minimize adverse impacts caused by secondary effects of these establishments. The county finds that studies in other jurisdictions demonstrating a correlation between these establishments and such negative secondary effects as diminishing market values in neighboring residential and related areas, increasing crime rates, difficulty in securing residential and related financing, an influx of patrons to these establishments from outside the immediate neighboring areas, and similar negative effects, are pertinent and relevant to the situation that exists in the county. These studies, as well as other evidence from the public and professional staff, has been carefully reviewed by the county prior to adoption of these regulations. The county further finds that there is evidence considered by the county prior to adoption of these and other county regulations regarding the combined effects of adult entertainment establishments and alcohol, and showing that the combination of such activities create additional pernicious secondary effects upon surrounding communities. The county finds that adoption of regulations restricting these establishments to certain districts, barring alcohol sales within such establishments, and imposing distance and development standards is consistent with the general comprehensive planning standards and policies of the county, will reduce the negative secondary effects caused by these establishments, and will afford protection to residential uses and other uses consistent with residential uses so as to protect the public health, safety, welfare and morality while respecting and protecting the free speech rights of these establishments.
