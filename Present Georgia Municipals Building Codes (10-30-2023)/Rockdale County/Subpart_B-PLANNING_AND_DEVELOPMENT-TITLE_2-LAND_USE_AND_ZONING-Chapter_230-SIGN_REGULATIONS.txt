The area of a sign is computed as the surface of the smallest square, rectangle, circle, triangle or combination thereof that will encompass entirely the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, such as a cabinet.
(2)
Individual sign areas shall be rounded to the nearest half square foot.
(3)
Minor appendages to a particular shape, as determined by the director or his/her designee, may be excluded from the computation. Such appendage shall not occupy more than ten percent of the individual sign area.

In the event that a court adjudges any part of the definition of a free speech sign a violation of the Georgia or United States Constitutions or any other provision of law, it is the specific intent of the Board of Commissioners of Rockdale County that the definition a free speech sign referencing a limitation to noncommercial speech or commercial speech that pertains to a commercial enterprise located on the property be omitted from the chapter and the remainder of the chapter stay in effect to regulate signs on property within the county. This severance section is in addition to the legislative intent of severance expressed elsewhere in this chapter.

Sec. 230-22. - Variances.
(a)
Where a literal application of this chapter would result in an unusual hardship, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, a variance may be granted by the board of adjustments pursuant to section 238-9. In reaching a decision, the board of adjustments shall consider the following criteria, at a minimum:
(1)
Exceptional physical conditions of the property where the sign is to be located as a result of its size, shape, or topography, which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area;
(2)
Without a variance, the applicant would be deprived of rights that are commonly enjoyed by others similarly situated;
(3)
Granting the variance would not confer on the applicant any significant privileges which are denied to others similarly situated;
(4)
The exceptional circumstances are not the result of action by the applicant;
(5)
The requested variance is the minimum variance necessary to allow the applicant to enjoy the rights commonly enjoyed by others similarly situated;

Granting the variance would not result in allowing a sign that interferes with road or highway visibility or obstruct or otherwise interfere with the safe and orderly movement of traffic.
(b)
The board of adjustments shall have the authority to grant variances from the dimensional standards of this chapter, in accordance with the standards and procedures as set forth in section 238-9.

Sec. 230-23. - Nonconforming and obsolete signs.
(a)
Nonconforming signs.
(1)
Findings. Rockdale County finds that nonconforming signs may adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare. Such signs may adversely affect the aesthetic characteristics of Rockdale County and may adversely affect public safety due to the visual impact of these signs on motorists and pedestrians. Furthermore, nonconforming signs frustrate the purpose of adoption of this chapter as expressed in article 1.
(2)
Continuation of nonconforming signs. A nonconforming sign that is permanently affixed to the ground or to a building may continue to be used, except that the nonconforming sign:
a.
Shall not be enlarged or altered except in conformance with this chapter, but it may be repaired to the extent necessary to maintain it in a safe condition;
b.
Shall not be expanded, modified or replaced by another non-conforming sign;
c.
Shall not be allowed to be increased in height, size or relocated on the property, but may be decreased in height or size;
d.
Shall be removed if the property on which the sign is located becomes vacant, or has been unoccupied for a period of at least six months. An intent to abandon is not required as the basis for removal under this subsection;
e.
Shall be removed if there is a change in ownership of the property or the business; and
f.
Shall not be repaired or restored after having been damaged to the extent of more than percent of its value immediately prior to the event causing the damage or destruction.
g.
To the extent any portion of this chapter conflicts with O.C.G.A. § 32-6-83 or Ga. Const. Art. 3 § 6, ¶ 4(a) in application, this section shall be deemed to provide affected parties the minimum protections provided by O.C.G.A. § 32-6-83 or Ga. Const. Art. 3 § 6, ¶ 4(a), as amended from time to time. In no event is it the county's intent to obligate itself to pay any compensation related to the removal of any nonconforming sign.
h.
The owner of the real property shall be responsible for assuming the burden of proof and present sufficient facts and evidence to demonstrate the nonconforming status of the sign in question.
(b)
Discontinuation of business. If a sign advertised an activity, product, business, service or other use which has ceased or the sign user has vacated the premises, the sign shall be considered obsolete and it shall be removed or the sign text shall be covered up in such a way as to render the text unreadable. The owner of the property on which the sign is located shall be responsible for removal (or covering) of the sign within 60 days of discontinuation of the business or service.
(Ord. No. 0-2012-11, § 1, 11-27-2012)
Sec. 230-24. - Enforcement and penalties.
(a)
The sign provisions of this article shall be administered and enforced by the director of department or his/her designee.
(b)
Removal of signs. The director of department or his/her designee may inspect signs regulated by this chapter at any time necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter. In case any sign is installed, erected or constructed in violation of any of the terms of this chapter, is unsafe, is abandoned, or is obsolete, the director of department shall notify by certified mail or written notice served personally, the owner or lessee thereof to correct the deficiencies or remove the sign. If such order is not completed within ten working days from the time of notice being received, the director of department or his/her designee may have the sign removed at the expense of the owner. If the identity of the sign owner cannot be determined, the real property owner will be responsible for correction of the deficiencies or removal of the delinquent sign.
(c)
The director of department or his/her designee may issue a citation for violation of this article by any person, including, if applicable, the owner, manager or tenant of the lot on which a sign is located; for a sign erected, altered, maintained, converted, or used in violation of this article; or in violation of any other applicable ordinance, including, but not limited to, building or electrical codes.
(d)
Any person violating any provision of this article shall be guilty of an offense, and upon conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be subject to a penalty of not less than $25.00 and no more than $1,000.00, or by confinement for a total time not to exceed 180 days, or both. Each day in which a sign is in violation of this chapter shall be a separate and distinct offense and shall be punishable as such.
(e)
Failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter may result in the loss of business license pursuant to section 22-39.
(f)
The county may seek affirmative equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to cause the removal or repair of any sign in violation of this article.
(g)
The director of department or his/her designee may remove any sign or structure illegally placed upon a public right-of-way without any notice and may dispose of said sign or structure. Such removal and disposal of illegally placed signs shall not preclude the prosecution of any person for illegally placing such signs in the public right-of-way.
(h)
A violation of any provision of this article will be grounds for terminating a permit granted by the county for the erection of a sign.

Sec. 230-25. - Severability.
In the event any section, subsection, sentence, or word of this article is declared and adjudged to be invalidated or unconstitutional, such declaration or adjudication shall not affect the remaining portions of this chapter, which shall remain in full force and effect as if such portion so declared or adjudged unconstitutional were not originally part of this chapter, even if the surviving parts of the ordinance result in greater restrictions after any unconstitutional provisions are stricken. The board of commissioners declares that it would have enacted the remaining parts of this chapter if it had known that such portion thereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional. The board of commissioners declares its intent that should this article be declared invalid in part or in whole, signs are to be subject to regulations applicable to structures contained in other ordinances, including the zoning resolution.
