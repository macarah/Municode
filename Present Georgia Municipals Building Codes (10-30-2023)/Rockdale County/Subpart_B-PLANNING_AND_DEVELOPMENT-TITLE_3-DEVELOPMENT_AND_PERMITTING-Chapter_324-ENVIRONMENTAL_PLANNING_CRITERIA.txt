Sec. 324-2. - Protection of wetlands.
(a)
Purpose and intent. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8 and the DNR, environmental protection division's Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria chapter 391-3-16, this section establishes regulations to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas.
(b)
Wetlands development permit requirements. No activity or use, except those identified in subsection (c), shall be allowed in the wetlands without issuance of a local development permit. Local permits will be issued only if the proposed use is in compliance with the requirements of the underlying zoning district and this section. Furthermore, if the area of proposed development is located within 100 feet of the wetlands boundaries, as established by Figure IV-2 of the Rockdale County Comprehensive Land Use Plan, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers delineation is required under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. If wetlands are altered or degraded, mitigation to offset losses may be required as a condition of a Section 404 permit. Local development permits will not be issued until after any necessary Section 404 permits have been secured.
(c)
Permitted uses. Subject to federal and state requirements, the following uses are permitted by right in wetlands to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided that they do not require structures, grading, filling, draining or dredging; unless a permit pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act is obtained.
(1)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with BMPs approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission.
(2)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the State of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that they would require an individual permit pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(3)
Outdoor passive recreation activities; including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(4)
Natural water quality treatment or purification.
(5)
