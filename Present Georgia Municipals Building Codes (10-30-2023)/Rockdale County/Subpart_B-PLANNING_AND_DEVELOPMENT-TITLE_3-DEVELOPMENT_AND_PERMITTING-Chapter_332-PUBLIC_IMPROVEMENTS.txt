Chapter 332 - PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS
ARTICLE I. - STREETS AND SIDEWALKS

Sec. 332-1. - Street classification and right-of-way requirements.
(a)
Street classification.
(1)
Streets are classified into a street hierarchy system based on road function and traffic volumes. Streets are classified into the following categories:
a.
Interstate principal arterials.
b.
Principal arterials.
c.
Minor arterials.
d.
Collector streets.
e.
Local streets in urban area boundaries.
(2)
The application for approval of a preliminary plat, site development plan, or building permit that will require the applicant to construct new public streets or make improvements to existing public streets shall determine the design of the street based on projected traffic volumes and use the right-of-way and lane widths as noted in the "table of minimum right-of-way and lane widths." The final determination regarding the classification of any existing or proposed street shall be made by the director.
(b)
Right-of-way and lane widths.
(1)
Minimum widths for new streets or roads shall be as shown in "table of minimum right-of-way and lane widths." See Rockdale County Standard Design and Construction Details for detailed dimensions. Total width of streets includes lane width plus curb and gutter (back to back of curb) or from edge of pavement if no curbs exist. Local streets will use a 24-inch curb and gutter. Other road/street classifications will use a 30-inch curb and gutter. If an existing street is used for access, the developer shall conform to the existing street width if it is greater than is required for a new street in this UDO.
(2)
Minimum widths of right-of-way and lanes shall be as shown in the table of right-of-way and lane widths.

  Notes:
*Lane widths include only pavement width. Example: Two lanes at 11 feet with two feet C&G would be 26 feet back to back of curb.
Ten-foot lanes are allowed in conservation residential subdivisions.
Lane widths on collector streets and other local (non-subdivision) streets will be based on design speed and traffic volumes.
Number of lanes will be determined based on traffic volumes, except for subdivision streets which will be typically two lanes only.
Street categories based on the current Federal Functional Classification System for Rockdale County.
Typical section details are shown in the Rockdale County Standard Design and Construction Details.
(c)
Right-of-way dedication.
(1)
The minimum width of right-of-way shall be dedicated based upon the street classification, as provided in this section and approved by the director.
(2)
On any existing street abutting a proposed development, one-half of the required width of right-of-way shall be dedicated, at no cost to Rockdale County, as measured from the centerline of the roadway along the entire property frontage. Right-of-way widths for existing streets shall be based on the current classification as determined by the director.
(3)
Additional right-of-way may be required at intersections or other locations fronting the property where turning lanes, storage lanes, medians, re-alignments or other traffic safety improvements are required.
(4)
If a new street or thoroughfare is proposed by Rockdale County or the State of Georgia to adjoin or traverse the property, the proposed road shall be accommodated into the development plans of the property in accordance with this UDO. These right-of-way requirements shall govern except where there exist clearly defined plans of the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) or Rockdale County that require additional right-of-way. In that case, the greater right-of-way requirements shall govern.
(d)
Clear zone requirements. All new roads/streets should utilize the concepts, designs, and philosophies in the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Roadside Design Guide, where practical and feasible to use the latest state-of-the-practice in roadside safety. New roads/streets should also use context-sensitive design concepts in the applications of clear zone. Context-sensitive design concepts are also on the GDOT web site (www.dot.state.ga.us). The application of clear zone concepts on existing roads/streets needs to be used where the greatest safety benefit can be realized. Crash reports, site investigations, and maintenance records offer starting points for identifying these locations.

Sec. 332-4. - Requirements for new streets and roadways.
(a)
All new streets proposed to be constructed in a subdivision or other development shall be designed and constructed to the minimum standards contained in this chapter, in accordance with the classification of streets.
(b)
If a new street or thoroughfare is proposed by Rockdale County or the State of Georgia to traverse the property, the proposed road shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the street classification as shown in the latest Federal Functional Classification System for Rockdale County and contained in this chapter or as shown on plans proposed by the county or State of Georgia. The specific vertical and horizontal alignment of the proposed roadway shall be as established or approved by Rockdale County and/or the State of Georgia, as applicable.
(c)
Substandard streets.
(1)
If a substandard street (dirt or gravel road or inadequate width of pavement or right-of-way) provides a means of access to a major subdivision or non-residential development, the street shall be upgraded to the street classification standard required by the Rockdale County/City of Conyers Functional Classification System and in accordance with this article. These improvements shall extend from the entrance of the development to the nearest standard paved road of an equivalent or higher classification, along the route of primary access.
(2)
All right-of-way required for these off-site improvements shall be acquired at the expense of the developer. Additional requirements may be mandated by the county as outlined in subsection (b).
(d)
Improvements along state highways. For any development that abuts a state or federal highway, improvements to the roadway and the location and design of any street or driveway providing access from the state highway shall comply with the standards and requirements of the GDOT and this chapter. A permit for the proposed access or improvements shall be required to have been approved by the GDOT and incorporated into the construction drawings for the project prior to issuance of a development permit by the department.
(e)
Permanent dead-end streets. See subsection 302-10(b).
(1)
New streets shall connect at both ends to existing streets unless the director determines that unique parcel configuration or terrain make a fully connected street pattern infeasible or unsafe.
(2)
When necessary, streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall provide a cul-de-sac turnaround and may be no more than 800 feet in length, unless otherwise approved by the director.
(3)
The length of a cul-de-sac street shall be measured from the center of the cul-de-sac to the center of the intersection with another street.
(4)
Cul-de-sacs shall conform to design requirements of the Rockdale County Standard Design and Construction Details.
(f)
Temporary dead-end streets.
(1)
A temporary dead-end street shall be provided to the boundary of a subdivision to provide access to abutting property for planned continuity of future circulation, improved access for public safety vehicles or for the extension of public water or other utilities to neighboring properties. Such dead-end streets shall be designed to meet the requirements of this article, and to allow their reasonable extension and shall be located so as to be reasonably incorporated into a street design for the neighboring property. A temporary vehicular turnaround shall be provided as shown in the standard details.
(2)
Existing dead-end streets on abutting property shall be extended into a proposed subdivision and incorporated into the street design of the development.
(3)
Subsections (1) and (2) of this subsection may be modified by the director in cases of serious topographical hardship or unacceptable land use conflicts between the two developments. This modification may be conditioned on the provision of easements necessary for the extension of public utilities, the provision of a cul-de-sac or other permanent turnaround on the dead-end street or the removal of the dead-end street back to its nearest intersection.
(4)
Where a dead-end street (other than a cul-de-sac) serves four or more lots in a multi-phase subdivision and such street is to be extended later, the developer shall be required to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround complying with subsection 332-1(b). This requirement may be waived if extension of the dead-end street is approved and under construction prior to its inclusion in a final plat.
(g)
Access roads. Where a development borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, major utility easement, limited access highway right-of-way or a major thoroughfare; a public street may be required to be constructed and dedicated within the development approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way. Locations of such service roads shall be aligned with similar service roads on adjacent properties.
(h)
Construction access drives are required for vehicles with gross weight of 10,000 pounds or more.
(1)
On multi-phase developments, the developer shall be required to dedicate, install, maintain and remove temporary construction access drives for the ingress and egress of construction vehicles, personnel and equipment.
(2)
Temporary construction access drives shall be shown on the concept plan and preliminary plat and shall access an existing county road where possible. Construction access drives shall be permitted through the department, and shall comply with sight distance requirements in subsection 332-3(e).
(3)
Temporary construction access drives shall be utilized as the sole means of ingress and egress during the construction of subsequent phases of the development, to prevent the flow of construction and heavy vehicular traffic on newly constructed streets completed under earlier phases.
(4)
If a temporary construction access drive cannot be provided at the discretion of the director, due to site-specific restrictions, then the developer shall provide a maintenance bond for those portions of the newly constructed roadway utilized for construction access. The maintenance bond shall provide surety for roadway repairs and resurfacing. The required bond amount per linear foot shall be the current amount established by the board of commissioners. The maintenance bond shall be provided to the county prior to the start of construction, and shall not expire for a period of 24 months following the completion of all construction activities.
(i)
Half streets. Both the construction of new half streets and the extension of access to existing half streets shall be prohibited. Whenever a street is planned adjacent to the proposed subdivision tract boundary, the entire street right-of-way shall be platted within the proposed subdivision.
(j)
Reserve strips. Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way, which could control or is intended to control access to streets, alleys or public lands, shall not be permitted unless control is given to the county under ownership, dedication or easement conditions approved by the county attorney or acceptable to the director. No development shall be designed so as to deny access to abutting properties.
(k)
Alleys. Alleys may be permitted by the director where lots are less than 75 feet in width or otherwise when the developer produces satisfactory grounds for the request. In the event the director approves the request, the alleys must be laid out in a grid fashion at rear lot lines, and double-fronting lots are permitted. The alley shall be designated as a public street pursuant to the standards contained in this chapter. Alleys shall not be permitted as dead end-streets.
(l)
Street jogs.
(1)
Local streets shall either directly align or have offsets of a minimum of 125 feet for residential subdivision streets and a minimum of 200 feet for non-residential subdivision streets, as measured between the centerlines.
(2)
Where it is not feasible to align new streets or entrances with an existing street intersecting nearby on the opposite side of a collector or arterial street, then the new street intersection shall be no less than 600 feet from the intersection of the existing street, as measured between centerlines of the two opposing streets.
(m)
Traffic-calming measures. Traffic-calming measures shall be incorporated in accordance with the Rockdale County Traffic-calming Guidelines. Specific measures may include easeabouts, speed tables or other methods approved by the director. Street layout and configuration should include a series of relatively short interconnected roadways in lieu of longer straight roads, to discourage excessive speeds. See section 332-10 of this article.

Walls shall be located at a distance from such water courses to allow for anticipated future maintenance of the easement to prevent a safety hazard to maintenance workers or to jeopardize the structural integrity of the wall.
(f)
Walls that are not attached to the permitted structure and require a foundation shall be permitted as a free-standing structure and shall be inspected, as prescribed by the permitting procedure. Walls will be inspected for conformance with the approved design. Any deviation from the approved design will require the engineer of record to submit a certification of the nonconforming structure along with supporting calculations to indicate that the construction is consistent with the initial design parameters. In the event the inspector has not been provided ample opportunity to inspect the structure, the contractor must provide a certification of the construction by the engineer of record and geotechnical reports for concrete testing for strength and reinforcing steel specifications. Failure to comply with the requirements of this section will require that the remaining work cease and/or removal of non-conformance until the adequacy of structural integrity is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director.
(g)
Retaining walls that are proposed for the purpose of stormwater retention must be designed in such a way that the walls are capable of a hydrostatic load, as measured from the top of the foundation footing to the highest elevation along the top of the wall. The hydrological design must allow for a free board dimension of one foot and an emergency overflow capacity equal to the allowable peak discharge for the 100-year storm event. The routing calculations should not take into account the existence of the emergency overflow. Place the overflow device above the projected 100-year flood elevation within the detention area.
(h)
Any construction that may impact or be within the right-of-way of an existing or proposed water or sanitary sewer easement must be approved by the utility providing service.

The cost of providing and maintaining street light service in existing street light districts and in street light districts hereafter created shall be borne by the lots and lot residents within the street light districts who are billed for utility services provided to the lots by utility providers who, by agreement with the county, will bill for street light service, whether or not the lot is located within the boundaries of a particular subdivision, so long as the lot is located within the boundaries of a street light district.
(b)
The charge, therefore, shall be determined by the department and approved by the board of commissioners and shall be posted and open for public inspection in the offices of the department and the clerk of the board of commissioners. The initial charge for each proposed street lighting district created by petition also shall be included on the petitions circulated through the proposed district. In the event of excessive vandalism to street lights within a district that results in the county being billed for repairs, the county may prorate those repair bills and add a pro rata share of those bills to the charge.
In those districts in existence as of the date of adoption of this UDO or that may hereafter be created in which there is construction cost, the same shall be retired as per agreement or contract with the public utility or other person to whom the indebtedness is owed and shall be accordingly per lot.
(c)
Payment date. The due date for the payment of the services and sums provided in this article shall be the same date of each month as the utilities are due to the utility provider that bills for lighting service on behalf of the county, and subject to the same penalties for late payment and for failure to pay. Any utility service provided by the utility provider may be discontinued for late payment or non-payment.
(d)
Responsibility for collection of money. The billing, accounting, collecting and receiving of the money provided for in this article shall be performed by Rockdale County Water Resources, which will, by agreement with the county, perform those functions on behalf of the county.

Sec. 332-45. - Standards of installation and operation.
(a)
In order to ensure adequate illumination of public rights-of-way and promote safety and security, the American National Standard Practice for Roadway Lighting of the Illuminating Engineering Society, as approved by the American National Standards Institute (1983), as from time to time amended, is hereby adopted as the standard for the installation and operation of lighting in the unincorporated areas of the county, with the following exceptions:
(1)
Except for principal arterials, lighting fixtures installed within the public rights-of-way to be operated for the purpose of street illumination shall comply with these standards. The minimum average horizontal footcandle illumination level by roadway classification shall be as shown in "Table of Minimum Average Street Illumination Levels"
Table of Minimum Average Street Illumination Levels (footcandles)
EXPAND
Roadway Classification Commercial Area Intermediate Area Residential Area
Minor Arterial 1.2 0.9 0.6
Collector Street 0.8 0.6 0.4
Local Street 0.6 0.5 0.3
  *Note: Illumination of Principal Arterials shall be determined by GDOT.
(2)
The uniformity of illumination shall be such that the point of lowest illumination shall have at least one-third of the average horizontal footcandle required illumination level, except that on local or residential streets it may be no less than one-sixth of this average.
(3)
Any party requesting permission to install or operate lighting fixtures within public rights-of-way shall furnish plans and specifications to the director for approval showing how the proposed lighting meets the standards, and no lighting shall be installed or operated without this approval.
(4)
Should the director disapprove the request to install or operate lighting fixtures within any public right-of-way, he shall communicate the disapproval in writing to the party requesting approval. The written communication shall include the specific reasons for disapproval.
(5)
Any disapproval of a light or lighting system by the director may be appealed to the board of commissioners. If any party desires to appeal an adverse decision by the director, a notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days from the date following the written notice of disapproval. It shall be the responsibility of the director to transmit forthwith to the board of commissioners all papers and allied documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The board of commissioners may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination being appealed.
(6)
Roadway or street lighting luminaries or fixtures installed within the public rights-of-way as security lights or for the purpose of lighting areas other than the public streets shall be mounted on the side of the pole opposite from the street, and shall be oriented in such a manner to ensure that the lateral light distribution pattern is parallel to the street and the vertical light distribution, at the initial light source, is perpendicular to the street, so as to protect the users of the street from objectionable glare. The approval of the department shall be obtained before installation of these lights.
(7)
Other lighting fixtures to be installed within or outside of public rights-of-way, for whatever purpose, shall be installed and operated in such a manner to prevent glare from being a hazard to or interfering with the normal use of the public rights-of-way.
(Ord. No. 0-2006-32, §§ 1—3, 11-28-2006)
