Sec. 302-9. - Design of lots.
(a)
Unbuildable lots prohibited. No preliminary plat shall be approved on which is shown a flag lot or other lot or parcel of land that would require a variance to be developed or used or that is otherwise unlawful or unbuildable, whether due to the presence of a floodplain, configuration, lack of public utilities, or other physical impediments.
(b)
Lot design standards. All lots established in connection with the development of a subdivision shall comply with the following design standards unless the proposed subdivision is covered by approved variances or conditions of zoning that take precedence:
(1)
Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to street lines, unless otherwise approved by the director.
(2)
Each lot shall have direct abutting access to an approved street.
(3)
Each lot shall abut a public street except those that front on an approved private residential street within a gated community, and shall contain at least 60 feet of street frontage, except for lots fronting on cul-de-sacs that shall abut a said public or private street with at least 30 feet of street frontage.

The as-builts must be submitted with the first review set of plans delivered to the Rockdale County Plans Coordinator.
General Requirements
(1)
Requirements for as-built plans submitted to Rockdale County.
a.
All as-built drawings must be referenced to the Rockdale County control network. All drawings must contain four-reference survey markers (pins or monuments) tied to the Rockdale County monument network. Each marker should have the coordinates established on the drawing. A copy of the Rockdale County monument network can be found on the county's website at:
www.rockdalecounty.org
or may be obtained in person at the Rockdale County Administrative Services building, Room 207. This requirement is in addition to the monument requirement contained in the Unified Development Ordinance.
b.
All features depicted in the as-built drawings must be surveyed after construction. Rockdale County may, at its discretion, spot check coordinates for accuracy. In the case where a spot check is made and a significant discrepancy exists, the as-builts will be rejected. A significant discrepancy is defined as greater than one and one-half times the horizontal or vertical tolerance.
c.
The following features are acceptable: Line, polyline, and polygon. Any other features such as leaders, blocks, etc., should not be present on the standard Rockdale County CAD features layers.
d.
Profiles for roads, stormwater and sewer are required.
e.
In addition to the electronic version, two sets of paper copies must be submitted.
f.
Electronic "as-built" files must be compatible with the Rockdale County Water Resources (RCWR) version of AutoCAD. Contact Rockdale County Water Resources for clarification.
g.
The following text blocks must be included in the electronic as-builts per RCWR Water and Wastewater Standards:
I certify that this project has been constructed in accordance with Rockdale County Water Resources Water and Wastewater Standards and Specifications, latest edition. I also certify that this project has been built as shown on the "As Built" drawings.
I certify that the plans and specifications of this project were designed in accordance with all applicable standards. I also certify that all facilities, structures and utilities were installed in full accordance with the project design drawings and specifications.
I certify that this project has been built as depicted on "As-Built" drawings. I further certify that I have field verified all elevations, volumes and locations as appropriate for the potable water, sanitary sewer and stormwater management structures depicted on these drawings.
(2)
The following are requirements for the layering of the as-built plans.
a.
Layer names for required layers must exactly match Rockdale County standard layer names.
b.
All required layers listed in the Rockdale County CAD layers must contain only the features that are described for that layer. For example, the "BOUNDARY_LINE" layer must only contain the boundary line and not such features as north arrows or parcels.
c.
All required layers must be present in the drawing except for features that do not pertain to a particular project. For example, some commercial projects or apartment complexes may not contain sewer taps as part of the construction and should not be included in the drawing.
d.
All layers must be clearly differentiated from each other.
e.
Two layers having the names "WATER_LINE" and "WATER_LINES" should not exist in the same drawing.
f.
"SEWER_LINE_TEXT" and "SEWER_TEXT" shall not exist in the same drawing.
g.
All text must appear on separate layers from the layers they annotate. For example, text describing a sewer line must be on the "SEWERLINE_TEXT" layer, not the "SEWERLINE" layer.
h.
Text leaders should be placed on the text layer, not the feature layer. For example, the leader for the diameter of a water pipe should be on "WATER_LINE_TEXT" layer, not the "WATER_LINE" layer. Leaders should be drawn using Line features, not Leaders.
