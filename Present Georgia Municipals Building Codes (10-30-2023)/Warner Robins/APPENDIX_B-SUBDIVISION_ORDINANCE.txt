Section 52. - Discretionary pre-application review.
Whenever the subdivision of a tract of land within the jurisdiction of the planning commission is proposed, the subdivider may, at his discretion, consult early and informally with the city's engineer for advice and assistance. Such early contact between the subdivider will prove beneficial to all parties involved and is encouraged. The subdivider may submit sketches and data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity and the proposed layout and development of the subdivision. If the tract of land is not to be initially subdivided in its entirety, the subdivider should provide sketches for the entire tract and indicate the proposed unit divisions of staged development boundaries.
Should the subdivider request a pre-application review, the city's engineer shall return the submitted sketch plans as quickly as possible and inform the subdivider where the plans do not comply with the requirements set forth in these regulations. No fee shall be charged for the pre-application review and no formal application shall be required. However, in no instance shall the discretionary pre-application review be made or accepted in lieu of the required plats and specifications contained herein.

ARTICLE 6. - GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN

Section 61. - Suitability of land.
Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, and erosion, as determined by the city's engineer and any land deemed by the planning commission to be unsuitable for development shall not be platted for any uses as may continue such conditions or increase danger of health, safety, life, or property unless steps are taken to eliminate the above-mentioned hazards.
Section 61A. - Land in special flood hazard districts.
The subdivider of any land located within a special flood hazard district shall comply with all the requirements set out in the zoning ordinance for such districts. In addition, the following requirements are established:
(1)
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
(2)
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
(3)
All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(4)
Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development which is greater than the lesser of fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres.
(Ord. No. 55-78, § 1, 12-18-78)
Section 62. - Access.
62.1 Every subdivision, and every lot within, shall be served by a publicly-dedicated street, except as herein provided.
62.1:1 If and when a development plan indicates the construction of streets, utilities or common space on private property, the owner shall indicate planned means for the maintenance of such streets and utilities, and such streets shall conform to construction specifications for the City of Warner Robins and access shall be provided over such streets to a public street having a right-of-way of not less than thirty (30) feet. In addition, the owner shall state, through an agreement prepared or approved by the city attorney, that the mayor and council for the City of Warner Robins shall be relieved of any responsibility for the maintenance of said improvements. Such agreements shall conform to the Georgia Condominium Act as applicable, and shall receive such approval prior to the final review by the planning and zoning commission.
62.2 When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets.
62.3 No subdivision shall be designed so as to completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land.
(Ord. No. 19-82, § 1, 6-7-82)
Section 63. - Conformance to the master comprehensive plan.
63.1 All proposed subdivisions shall conform to the Master Comprehensive Plan, zoning and subdivision regulations, and development policies in effect at the time of submission to the planning commission.
63.2 All highways, streets, and other features of the Master Comprehensive Plan shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and to the dimension indicated on the Comprehensive Plan. In subdivisions related to or affecting any state or federally numbered highway, the approval of the state department of transportation may be required by the planning commission.
63.3 Where features of the Comprehensive Plan (other than minor streets and collector streets) such as school sites, parks, arterial streets, major thoroughfares, and other public spaces are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, or when these features have not been anticipated by the Comprehensive Plan and planning policy, but are considered essential by the planning commission, such features shall be dedicated or in lieu of dedication shall be reserved by the subdivider. Whenever such reserved land, or any portion thereof, is not acquired, optioned or condemned by the appropriate public agency within a one (1) year period from the date of recording the subdivision, the subdivider may claim the original reservation, or portion thereof, and cause it to be subdivided in a manner suitable to the subdivider subject to the provisions of these rules and regulations.
63.4 The planning commission may waive the above mentioned platting and reservation requirements of Section 63.2 and Section 63.3, whenever the public body responsible for land acquisition executes a written release stating that such a planned feature is not being acquired.
63.5 Whenever the plat proposes the dedication of land to public use and the planning commission or the appropriate agency finds that such land is not required or suitable for public use, the planning commission may either refuse to approve said plat or it may require the rearrangements of lots to include such land.
Section 64. - Zoning and other regulations.
Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions noted herein and those contained in other official regulations or resolution, the most restrictive shall apply.
Section 65. - Planned unit development.
65.1 The standards and requirements of these regulations may be modified in the case of plan and program for a planned unit development which is not divided into customary lots, blocks and streets, which, in the judgement of the planning commission, provides adequate public spaces and improvements for the circulation, recreation, light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated, provided zoning density standards for the entire tract are not exceeded, and which also provides such covenants or other legal procedures as will assure conformity to and achievement of the plan. Plans for such developments shall be submitted to and approved by the planning commission whether or not such plat is to be recorded and no building permits shall be issued until such approval has been given.
65.2 No plans for a planned unit development plan shall be reviewed or approved by the commission before the developer's site has been zoned to allow such use.
Section 66. - Modifications to subdivision principles and standards of design.
66.1 Modifications of the provisions set forth in these rules and regulations may be recommended by the planning commission. The city council shall be the granting authority for such modifications. These modifications may be granted in specific cases when, after a finding of fact, it is determined that undue hardship will result from strict compliance; provided any such determination shall be based fundamentally on the fact that unusual topographical or other exceptional conditions require such modifications. Furthermore, the granting of such modifications by the city council will not adversely affect the general public, create any public liability, or nullify the intent of these regulations; provided further that any such modifications shall not be in instances where the hardship is a result of the actions of the subdivider.
66.2 Application for any modifications must be filed in writing with necessary supporting documents with the planning commission by the subdivider and shall explain in detail the reasons and facts supporting the application. Should any modification be granted by the city, the subdivider shall be notified in writing and such notice and modification shall be made part of the subdivision plats and plans and also the records of the planning commission.
Section 67. - Name of subdivision.
The name of the subdivision shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision, except in the case where the subdivision is a section or part of a larger subdivision being developed by the same subdivider in phases, sections, or stages. In this case, the name of the overall subdivision can be used for each phase, stage, or section, but the phase, or section number must also be included as part of the same.
ARTICLE 7. - DESIGN STANDARDS

Section 71. - Required design standards.
The design standards set forth in this article shall be observed in all plats which are required to be approved by the planning commission. In addition, those standards required for the installation of subdivision improvements (Article 8) are required when applicable.
Section 72. - Streets.
72.1 The arrangements, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the city's Major Thoroughfare Plan and shall be considered in their relationship to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
72.2 Where such is not shown in the city's Major Thoroughfare Plan the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
(a)
Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets in surrounding areas at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum width.
(b)
Conform to a neighborhood plan approved or adopted by the planning commission to meet a particular situation.
72.3 Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.

72.8 A proposed subdivision that includes a platted street that does not conform to the minimum right-of-way requirements of these regulations shall provide for the dedication of additional right-of-way along either one or both sides of said street so that the minimum right-of-way required by these regulations can be established. If the proposed subdivision abuts upon only one side of said street, then a minimum of one-half of the required extra right-of-way shall be dedicated or reserved by such subdivision.
72.9 Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle less than seventy-five (75) degrees. Detailed designed of intersections may be required.
72.10 Curb line radius at street intersections shall be at least twenty (20) feet and where the angle of street intersection is less than ninety (90) degrees, the planning commission may require a greater radius.
72.11 Right-of-way radius at street intersections shall parallel the curb line radius.
72.12 Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than two hundred (200) feet shall not be permitted.

An official engineering inspection shall be made after each phase of work is completed. Subsequent phases shall not begin until written permission for new work is extended by the engineer.
After all subdivision work has been performed satisfactorily, the city engineer shall recommend to the city that the subdivision be officially accepted. His recommendations shall be based upon the results of his own inspections, and input provided by other city departments.
Any building erected in violation of this section shall be deemed as an unlawful structure, and the building inspector, platting officer, city attorney, or other official designated by mayor and council may bring appropriate action to enjoin such erection or cause it to be vacated or removed.
88.3 Official acceptance by the city. The city may officially accept the completed work on the construction and installation of required public improvements at any time after the date of the written acceptance by the city engineer but not before approval by the planning commission of the final plat and/or any "As Built" plans which may be required.
88.4 Maintenance of completed work. The subdivider shall maintain his completed work until the approval by the city engineer as described above.

During the "maintenance period" the city engineer shall make periodic inspections and notify the subdivider of necessary corrections. At the end of the maintenance period, the city engineer shall make a final inspection and report his findings to the city. Necessary corrections not made by the subdivider will be completed by the city.
