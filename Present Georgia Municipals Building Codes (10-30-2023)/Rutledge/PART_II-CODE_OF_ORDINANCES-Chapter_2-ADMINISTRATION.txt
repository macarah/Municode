Meeting means the gathering of a quorum of the members of the governing body of an agency or of any committee of its members created by such governing body, whether standing or special, pursuant to schedule, call, or notice of or from such governing body or committee or an authorized member, at a designated time and place at which official business or policy of the agency is to be discussed or at which official action is to be taken or, in the case of a committee, recommendations on official business or policy to the governing body are to be formulated or discussed. The assembling together of a quorum of the members of a governing body or committee for the purpose of making inspections of physical facilities under the jurisdiction of such agency or for the purposes of meeting with the governing bodies, officers, agents, or employees of other agencies at places outside the geographical jurisdiction of an agency and at which no final official action is to be taken shall not be deemed a meeting.
(b)
Meetings. The city council shall hold regular meetings at 7:00 p.m. on the second Monday of the month at the city hall, unless otherwise ordered by the city council, provided, that the mayor may convene the city council whenever in his opinion the public business requires it, and he shall do so upon the application of two members of the city council. All meetings at which official actions are to be taken shall be open to the public.
(1)
Notice. The mayor and city council shall prescribe the time, place, and dates of regular meetings of the mayor and city council. Such information shall be available to the general public and a notice containing such information shall be posted and maintained in a conspicuous place available to the public at the regular meeting place of the agency. Meetings shall be held in accordance with a regular schedule, but nothing in this subsection shall preclude an agency from canceling or postponing any regularly scheduled meeting. Whenever any meeting required to be open to the public is to be held at a time or place other than at the time and place prescribed for regular meeting, the mayor and city council shall give due notice thereof. Due notice shall be the posting of a written notice for at least 24 hours at the place of regular meetings and giving of written or oral notice at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting to the legal organ in which notices of sheriff's sales are published in the county where regular meetings are held or, at the option of the mayor and city council, to a newspaper having a general circulation in said county at least equal to that of the legal organ; provided, however, that in counties where the legal organ is published less often than four times weekly, "due notice" shall be the posting of a written notice for at least 24 hours at the place of regular meetings and, upon written request to any local broadcast or print media outlet whose place of business and physical facilities are located in the county, notice by telephone or facsimile to that media outlet at least 24 hours in advance of the called meeting. When special circumstances occur and are so declared by the mayor and city council, the mayor and city council may hold a meeting with less than 24 hours' notice upon giving such notice of the meeting and subjects expected to be considered at the meeting as is reasonable under the circumstances, including notice to the county legal organ or a newspaper having a general circulation in the county at least equal to that of the legal organ, in which event the reason for holding the meeting within 24 hours and the nature of the notice shall be recorded in the minutes. Whenever notice is given to a legal organ or other newspaper, that publication shall immediately make the information available upon inquiry to any member of the public. Any oral notice required or permitted by this subsection may be given by telephone.
(2)
Agenda and minutes. An agenda of the subjects acted on and those members present at a meeting of the mayor and city council shall be written and made available to the public for inspection within two business days of the adjournment of a meeting of the mayor and city council.

(9)
Ordinances, resolutions, regulations, contracts and inter-local agreements. Unless otherwise provided in this Code or under state law, all ordinances, resolutions, contracts, and inter-local agreements of the city shall be prepared, approved, introduced, and adopted in the following manner:
a.
Preparation. All ordinances shall be prepared by the city attorney. No ordinance shall be prepared for presentation to the city council unless ordered by a majority vote of the city council, or requested in writing by the mayor, or prepared by the city attorney on his own initiative.
b.
Administrative staff approval. All ordinances, resolutions, and contract documents shall, before presentation to the city council, have been approved as to form and legality by the city attorney or his authorized representative, and shall have been examined and approved for administration by the mayor or his authorized representative where there are substantive matters of administration involved. All such instruments shall have first been referred to the head of the department under whose jurisdiction the administration of the subject matter of the ordinance, resolution, or contract document would involve and be approved by the department head; provided, however, that if approval is not given, then the same shall be returned to the mayor with a written memorandum of the reasons why such approval is withheld. In the event the questioned instrument is not redrafted to meet a department head objection, or objection is not withdrawn and approval in writing given, then the mayor shall so advise the city council and give the reasons advanced by the department head for withholding approval.
c.
Introduction and adoption.
1.
Every proposed ordinance shall be introduced in writing and in the form required for final adoption. No ordinance shall contain a subject which is not expressed in its title. The enacting clause shall be "the Council of the City of Rutledge hereby ordains …" and every ordinance shall so begin.

6.
An ordinance, resolution, or contract shall be deemed, adopted, or rejected by the city council in accordance with the rules which the city council shall establish. Such ordinances adopted by the city council shall have the full force and effect of law.
d.
Effective date.

e.
Emergencies. To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property, or public peace, the city council may convene on call of the mayor or three members of the city council and may promptly adopt an emergency ordinance, but such ordinance shall not levy taxes; grant, renew, or extend a franchise; regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services; or authorize the borrowing of money except for loans to be repaid within 30 days. An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing the emergency in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted, with or without amendment, or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least three members of the city council shall be required for adoption. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify. Every emergency ordinance shall automatically stand repealed 30 days following the date upon which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency continues to exist. An emergency ordinance shall also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances.
(10)
Recording vote. Whenever any member shall request it, the yeas and nays of the members present shall be recorded on the minutes on any question taken.
