1.
The proposed use will not be contrary to the purpose(s) of this ordinance.
2.
The proposed use will not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood, nor affect adversely the health and safety of residents and workers.

4.
The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses, and the proposed use will be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use.

6.
Provided, the Board of Commissioners may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood, provided that, wherever the County Commission shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations, that any term, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, said Commission shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
Sec. 10. - Variances.
The Planning Commission may recommend to the Board of Commissioners approval of certain, specified variance from the requirements of the ordinance. The Board of Commissioners shall have the power to authorize variance from the terms of this ordinance where a literal enforcement of the zoning requirements would result in undue hardship, but where exercise of such authority is not contrary to the public interest.
1.
Procedure - Applications for variance shall be filed with the Office of the Zoning Administrator; such application must be filed 30 days before the date of the following Planning Commission meeting in order that the required public notice may be given before the next scheduled meeting. Each application shall be accompanied by a simple sketch of the site, showing the following:
A.
General location of existing structures and property lines.
B.
Location of proposed buildings and land use.
C.
Setbacks if applicable to the request.

Conditions and limitations - The Board of Commissioners shall include any condition, requirement, or limitation which may be necessary to protect adjacent properties and to carry out the provisions of this resolution.
Sec. 11. - Criteria for the Consideration of Variance Requests.
The following criteria shall be utilized when considering request for variance from the terms of the ordinance, when approval of such will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, yet maintain the spirit of this ordinance and preserve and secure the public safety and welfare. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding of the Board of Commissioners that:
1.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question and because of its size, shape or topography; and
2.
Strict application of this ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an undue hardship, and
3.
Such conditions are particular to the particular piece of property involved and not the making of the applicant, and
4.
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good, or impair the purposes and intent of this ordinance, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance.
5.
The proposed use will be of such location, size and character that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the surrounding neighborhood.
6.
The proposed use will be of a nature that vehicular and pedestrian traffic will be no more hazardous than is normal for the district involved.
7.
The location, size, intensity, site layout and periods of operation of any such proposed use will be designed to eliminate any possible nuisance (dust, noises, fumes, vibration, smoke or lights, etc.) emanating from the use which might be noxious to the occupants of other nearby uses, and,
8.
The location and height of buildings or structures and the location, nature and height of walls and fences will be such that the proposed use will not interfere with or discourage appropriate development and the use of adjacent land and buildings, or unreasonably affect their value.
Sec. 12. - Certificate of Zoning Compliance.
A certificate of zoning compliance, issued by the Zoning Administrator, and certifying that the proposed structure, land use, or alteration complies with the provisions of the zoning resolution, is required.
1.
Site plan - Each application for a certificate of zoning compliance shall be accompanied by a simple sketch of the site and indicating such information as may be needed to present a record of existing conditions and proposed use including proposed off-road parking and/or loading areas.
2.
Time limit - A certificate of zoning compliance shall become invalid after the use authorized is suspended or abandoned for the period of one year.
Sec. 13. - Appeals.
An appeal by a person, firm, or corporation, or by any officer department, board or bureau may be taken to the Dooly County Board of Commissioners where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning Administrator or other administrative official in the enforcement and interpretation of this ordinance. Such appeals shall be made within 30 days of the administrative action by filing with the Dooly County Clerk of Commissioners a Notice of Appeal specifying the grounds thereof. If the Notice of Appeal is not filed within the 30 days, the only recourse shall be a court of record.
The County Clerk shall then transmit to the Board of Commissioners all papers constituting the record upon which the appeal was taken. The appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board of Commissioners after the Notice of Appeals has been filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the Notice, a stay would, in the Zoning Administrator's opinion, cause immediate peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed, other than by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court of record.
The Board of Commissioners shall fix a reasonable amount of time for the hearing of an appeal and shall give due notice to the parties concerned, including all landowners within 300 feet of the site in question. Such notice shall be delivered personally or by mail, addressed to the respective owners at the address given on the last assessment roll. The Board of Commissioners shall decide the appeal within a reasonable period of time with regard to the purposes of the ordinance. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or through their agent.
In the event the petitioner for an appeal remains discontented with the Board of Commissioner's decision on an appeal application, the petitioner shall have 30 days to appeal the action to Dooly County Superior Court.
Sec. 14. - Fees.
Fees for administration, inspection, application for rezoning, variance or conditional use applications and the issuance of permits or copies thereof required or issued under the provisions of this ordinance shall be collected by the Zoning Administrator in advance of the issuance of such permits.
The fee for rezoning, variance or conditional use application shall be $50.00, and is hereby established by the Board of Commissioners to cover the cost of administration, inspection and supervision resulting from the enforcement of this ordinance.
