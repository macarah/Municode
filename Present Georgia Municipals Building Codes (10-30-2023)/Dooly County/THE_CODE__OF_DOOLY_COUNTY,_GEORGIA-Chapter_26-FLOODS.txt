the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or
(2)
in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the Code Enforcement Official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.

Sec. 26-32. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact and objectives.
(a)
State authorization. The Legislature of the State of Georgia has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. The Board of Commissioners of Dooly County, Georgia, establishes this article.
(b)
Findings of fact.
(1)
The flood hazard areas of the County are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(2)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(c)
Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(d)
Objectives. The objectives of this division are:
(1)
To protect human life and health;
(2)
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(3)
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
(4)
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(5)
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(6)
To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
(7)
To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

(b)
The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals Board may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Dooly County.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing such requests, the Appeals Board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(h)
Conditions for variances:
(1)
A variance shall be issued ONLY when there is:
a.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(2)
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building;
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation;
(4)
The Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

(Ord. No. 95-04, art. 4, § A, 4-4-1995)
Sec. 26-92. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in Section 26-34, Section 26-63 (2), or Section 26-93, the following provisions are required:
(1)
Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 26-92 (4).
(2)
Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Structures located in AE or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the base flood elevation, plus one foot, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, are designed to be water tight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in Section 26-63 (4), (5).
(3)
Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 26-34, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), OR where base flood data have been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply:
a.
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with Section 26-34, then the Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Division 3. If data are not available from these sources, then the following subsections b. and c. shall apply.
b.
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
c.
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. The Administrator shall record the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(4)
Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the base flood elevation formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
a.
Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
1.
Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
2.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
3.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction.
b.
So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be use for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and
c.
The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
(5)
Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
a.
All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on individual lots or parcels, in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
b.
Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either:
1.
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or
2.
The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
c.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to the adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
d.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
1.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or
2.
The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "New Construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of Section 26-92 (5) a. and c.
(6)
Floodways. Located within areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Section 26-34, are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer shall provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
b.
Only if Section 26-66 (6) a. is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 26-64
(Ord. No. 95-04, art. 3, § B, 4-4-1995)
Sec. 26-93. - Standards for subdivision proposals.
(a)
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
(b)
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
(c)
All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(d)
Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less.
