ARTICLE XII. - FLOOD HAZARD ZONE FH

Sec. 1. - Statement of Purpose.
The Food Hazard zone is established to promote public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
1.
require that land uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
2.
restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
3.
control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
4.
prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which well unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
5.
control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channel, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters.
More specifically, this zone is established to:
1.
protect human life and health;
2.
minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
3.
to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
4.
to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
5.
to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
6.
to minimize prolonged business interruptions;
7.
to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
Sec. 2. - District Boundaries.
The Flood Hazard zone boundary of this ordinance shall be synonymous and coterminous with the areas of Special Flood Hazard as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Flood Insurance Rate Map with an effective date of June 4, 1996, and any subsequent revisions thereto. The Planning Commission may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but which have not been incorporated in the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
Sec. 3. - Permitted Uses.
The Flood Hazard zone is an overlay zone which applies to all other zones identified herein to the extent to which Special Flood Hazard areas identified by FEMA in the FIRM map overlap with the other zones. The flood hazard zone does not consist of permitted and conditional uses, but imposes conditions for development on all permitted uses, and additional conditions on conditional uses enumerated in all other zones. In reviewing plans for development in the flood hazard zone the Planning Commission shall be guided by the following standards:
1.
Any structure or filling of land permitted shall be of a type not appreciably damaged by flood waters.
2.
Any structure or filling of land permitted shall be designed, constructed and placed on the lot so as to offer minimum obstruction to, and effect upon, the flow of water.
3.
Any structure, equipment or material permitted shall be firmly anchored to prevent it from floating away, and thus damaging other structures and threatening to obstruct bridge openings and other restricted sections of the stream.
4.
Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, topographic data, engineering and other studies are needed to determine the effects of flooding on a proposed structure or fill and/or the effect of the structure or fill on the flow of water, the Planning Commission may require the applicant to submit such data or other studies prepared by competent engineers or other technical people.
5.
The granting of approval of any structure or land use in the floor hazard zone shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind or nature by Dooly County or by any officer or employee thereof, of the practicality or safety of any structure or use proposed, and shall create no liability upon or cause action against such public body, officer or employee for any damage that may result pursuant thereto.
