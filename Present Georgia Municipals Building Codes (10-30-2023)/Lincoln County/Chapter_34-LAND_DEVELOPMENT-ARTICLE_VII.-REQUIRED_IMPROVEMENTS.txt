ARTICLE VII. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS

Sec. 34-201. - Number of lots versus improvement standards.
(a)
Less restrictive development standards. By permitting varying numbers of lots and varying levels of improvements, regulations enable the small developer to provide for growth in the rural, more slowly developing area of the county characterized by a lower lot absorption rate. Less restrictive development standards are imposed according to quantity of lots to allow for flexibility in subdivision sizes.
EXPAND
Subdivision Type Number of Lots Required Improvements
Division of land 1 to 4 Site grading for adequate drainage; electricity; lighting requirements; telephone; street signs within the subdivision; paved streets within the subdivision.
Major subdivision 5 or more All required improvements established in section 34-202.
  (b)
Waiver provision. Where a single lot or parcel of land, in an existing residentially zoned district, is to be subdivided into two or three parcels, the planning commission may waive any and all of the subdivision requirements indicated in section 34-202 under the following conditions:
(1)
The created lots or parcels meet the lot requirements of this chapter.
(2)
All the resultant lots or parcels will have frontage on a county or state maintained roadway or access will be provided through a roadway that meets all criteria of a private street as specified in section 34-207.
(Ord. No. 48, § 8-1, 1-9-2003)
_____
Sec. 34-202. - Required improvements.
A well-designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat.
(1)
Natural gas. When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way, where possible such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties.
(2)
Water supply. When a water system is installed in a subdivision with more than 30 lots, water mains shall provide a minimum flow of water of 500 gallons per minute for two hours at the furthermost point from the tank. Fire hydrants, whether part of a wet or a dry fire hydrant system, shall be provided at distances not greater than 500 feet apart. When the water main is located in the street to serve the abutting lots a water service line three-fourths inch in size shall be stubbed-out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced. When connection to a county water system is not available, the county may make an exception to this rule. At the preliminary plat stage, unless granted a waiver by the Lincoln County Board of Commissioners, the water system of a development must connect to the county water system. All systems commercial or residential, public or private, must be approved by the board of commissioners. The water system shall be a permitted community water system as required by the Georgia Safe Drinking Water Act of 1977 (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-170 et seq.).
(3)
Sanitary sewage. If sanitary sewers are installed in a subdivision, sanitary sewers shall be installed to the plans and specifications approved by and in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county health department. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed-out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. The subdivider shall install sewer mains and sewer laterals, extended to the property line of each lot, in accordance with accepted engineering practices.
(4)
Sewage disposal systems. Prior to the construction of a community sewage disposal system such as private septic tanks, an oxidation pond or other facility, the location, size, plans and specifications of such facility shall be approved by and be in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the board of commissioners and the county health department.
(5)
Lighting requirements. In accordance with the requirements of this chapter, lighting requirements necessitate that:
a.
All public streets, sidewalks and other common areas or facilities in subdivisions created after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be sufficiently illuminated to ensure the security of property and the safety of persons using such streets, sidewalks and other common areas or facilities.
b.
All roads, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots and other common areas and facilities in unsubdivided developments shall be sufficiently illuminated to ensure the security of property and the safety of persons using such roads, driveways, parking lots and other common areas and facilities.
c.
All subdivision entrances shall be adequately lighted to ensure the safety of persons entering and exiting subdivisions.
d.
All entrances and exits in buildings used for nonresidential purposes and in two-family or multifamily residential developments containing more than four dwelling units shall be adequately lighted to ensure the safety of persons and the security of the buildings.
e.
Lighting within any lot that unnecessarily illuminates any other lot and substantially interferes with the use or enjoyment of such other lot is prohibited. Lighting unnecessarily illuminates another lot if it clearly exceeds the standard set forth in this subsection. Also, if the standard set forth in this subsection could reasonably be achieved in a manner that would not substantially interfere with the use or enjoyment of neighboring properties.
(6)
Electricity. Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall have available to it a source of electric power adequate to accommodate the reasonable need of such use and every lot within such subdivision.
(7)
Telephone service. Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall have available to it a telephone service cable adequate to accommodate the reasonable need of such use and every lot within such subdivision.
(8)
Curb and gutters. If concrete curbs or paved valley type gutters are required, they shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by an engineer, registered surveyor or architect and approved by the director or board of commissioners or its designee.
(9)
Street grading and surfacing. Street grading, base preparation, and surfacing shall be carried out by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the county and/or state department of transportation. Prior to acceptance of the streets as part of the county road system, the same must be paved at the expense of the developer and/or owner in accordance with approved plans and specifications and must be conveyed or transferred to the county upon acceptance. The requirement of paved streets prior to acceptance shall not apply to the acceptance process related to public roads.
(10)
Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the director.
a.
To the extent practicable, all development shall conform to natural contours of land, and natural and preexisting manmade drainageways shall remain undisturbed.
b.
To the extent practicable, lot boundaries shall be made to coincide with natural and preexisting manmade drainageways within subdivisions to avoid the creation of lots that can be built upon only by altering such drainageways.
c.
All developments shall be provided with a drainage system that is adequate to prevent the undue retention of surface water on the development site.
d.
No surface water may be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer.
e.
Whenever practicable, the drainage system of a development shall coordinate with and connect to the drainage systems or drainageways on surrounding properties or streets.
f.
Private roads and accessways within unsubdivided developments shall utilize curb and gutter storm drains to provide adequate drainage if the grade of such roads or accessways is too steep to provide drainage in another manner or if other sufficient reasons exist to require such construction.
g.
All developments shall be constructed and maintained so that adjacent properties are not unreasonably burdened with surface water as a result of such developments. More specifically:
1.
No development may be constructed or maintained so that such development unreasonably impedes the natural flow of water from higher adjacent properties across such development, thereby unreasonably causing substantial damage to such higher adjacent properties; and
2.
No development may be constructed or maintained so that no additional surface waters from such development are channeled onto lower adjacent properties.
(11)
Fire hydrants. In accordance with this chapter, the adequate provision of fire hydrants necessitates that:
a.
Every development subdivided or unsubdivided that is served by a public water system shall include a system of fire hydrants sufficient to provide adequate fire protection for the buildings located or intended to be located within such development. If the development is not served by a public water system, a dry fire hydrant system shall be installed subject to the requirements of this subsection.
b.
The fire hydrants must be located so that all parts of every building within the development may be served by a hydrant by laying not more than 500 feet of hose connected to such hydrant. However, the fire chief of the applicable district may authorize or require a deviation from this standard if in his professional opinion another arrangement more satisfactorily complies with the standard set forth in subsection (11)a.
c.
The fire chief of the applicable district shall determine the precise location of all fire hydrants, subject to the other provisions of this section. In general, fire hydrants shall be placed six feet behind the curbline of publicly dedicated streets that have curb and gutter.
d.
The fire chief of the applicable district shall determine the design standards of all hydrants based on fire flow needs. Unless otherwise specified by the fire chief, all hydrants shall have two 2½-inch hose connections and one 4½-inch hose connection. The 2½-inch hose connection shall be located at least 21½ inches from the ground level. All hydrant threads shall be national standard threads.
e.
Water lines that serve hydrants shall be at least six-inch lines, and, unless no other practicable alternative is available, no such line shall be dead-end lines.
(12)
Street name signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections within a subdivision. The location and design shall be approved by the director.
(13)
Slopes.
a.
No existing or proposed cut or fill shall be deeper than two horizontal units to one vertical unit.
b.
All fill slopes created for the purpose of street or other construction shall have a compaction of not less than 95 percent standard proctor as determined by established engineering practices.
c.
All slopes created or existing within the subdivision or as a result of the subdivision development shall be planted or otherwise protected from erosion and sedimentation failure.
(14)
Topsoil. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover on the lots and at least four inches of cover between sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting. The excavation and treatment of overburden during construction shall be inspected by the soil conservation office.
(15)
Subdivision entrances. At the preliminary plat stage, the planning commission may limit the number of entrances, driveways, or curb cuts. At the preliminary and final plat stages, the planning commission shall be consistent with all state, federal, and local laws and applicable ordinances, including the state department of transportation rules and all amendments or revisions in effect as of the date of the preliminary plat approval. At the preliminary plat stage, the planning commission may consider safety as well as require available alternatives for adjusting the number of entrances, driveways or curb cuts.
All entrances to residential subdivisions shall be landscaped.

Sec. 34-203. - Underground utilities.
(a)
All electric power lines (not to include transformers or enclosures containing electrical equipment including, but not limited to, switches, meters or capacitors which may be pad mounted), telephone, gas distribution and cable television lines in subdivisions constructed after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be placed underground in accordance with the specifications and policies of the respective utility service providers.
(b)
Whenever an unsubdivided development is hereafter constructed on a lot that is undeveloped on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, then all electric power, telephone, gas distribution and cable television lines installed to serve the development that are located on the development site outside of a previously existing public street right-of-way shall be placed underground in accordance with the specifications and policies of the respective utility companies.
(Ord. No. 48, § 8-3, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-204. - Utilities to be consistent with internal and external development.
(a)
Whenever it can reasonably be anticipated that utility facilities constructed in one development will be extended to serve other adjacent or nearby external developments, such utility facilities (e.g., water or sewer lines) shall be located and constructed so that extensions can be made conveniently and without undue burden or expense or unnecessary duplication of service.
(b)
All utility facilities shall be constructed in such a manner as to minimize interference with pedestrian or vehicular traffic and to facilitate maintenance without undue damage to improvements or facilities located within the development.
(Ord. No. 48, § 8-4, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-205. - As-built drawings required.
Whenever a developer installs or causes to be installed any utility line in any public right-of-way, the developer shall, as soon as practicable after installation is complete, and before acceptance of any water or sewer line, furnish the county with a copy of a drawing in both paper and electronic format that shows the exact location of such utility lines. Such drawings must be verified as accurate by the utility service provider. Compliance with this requirement shall be a condition of the continued validity of the permit authorizing such development.
(Ord. No. 48, § 8-5, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-206. - Dedications.
After the adoption of a major street plan as provided by law, the county or other public authority shall not accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave or light any street or authorize the laying of water mains, sewers, connections or other facilities or utilities in any street within the territorial jurisdiction of the board of commissioners unless such street has been accepted or opened as, or shall otherwise have received the legal status of, a public street prior to the attachment of the board of commissioner's jurisdiction, or unless such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat duly approved by the planning commission. The board of commissioners may locate and construct or may accept any other street provided that the ordinance or resolution or other measure for such approval be first submitted to the director and the planning commission for approval or disapproval as provided for in the procedure on plats and, upon approval, any such street shall have the status of an approved street as fully as though it had been originally shown on a subdivision plat duly approved according to this chapter.
(Ord. No. 48, § 8-6, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-207. - Private streets.
A street which is not accepted as a public street shall have the status of private street. Private streets may be approved for development only when they are eligible for categorization as a local street. The street shall be designed as to prohibit through traffic. To allow for installation of utilities, there shall be a five-foot utility easement indicated on the plat. Any private street shall be developed to present county standards. Prior to the issuance of building permits for lots within the development, the developer shall file with the director a release of maintenance agreement, releasing the county from any present or future maintenance of the streets. A sign indicating the existence of a private street will be erected at the intersection of each public street and private street. A disclosure statement shall be present on all plats of the subdivision and/or individual lots included in all sales contracts. The statement shall set forth the ownership of the streets, the rights of purchasers and others to use the streets, provisions and responsibilities for maintenance and liability, and rights of purchasers to enforce the provisions. Further, the statement shall advise purchasers that the county is not responsible for the maintenance of private streets. An association with the authority and responsibility to maintain the private streets must be established and approved by the planning commission. The board of commissioners or its designee may require a specific maintenance plan and/or financial guarantee to insure the continued safety and good order of private streets.
(Ord. No. 48, § 8-7, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-208. - Access.
The planning commission shall not approve a subdivision in a location where the existing roads providing primary access are inadequate to serve the additional traffic generated by the development. If the ditches on existing county streets are to be used for drainage from the subdivision, the developer will regrade the ditches and provide an all-weather drainage outlet. All regrading and drainage outlets shall be approved by the board of commissioners or its authorized representatives.
(Ord. No. 48, § 8-8, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-209. - Permanent reference points.
Prior to the approval of the final plat, all of the subdivision's permanent reference points shall have been placed in accordance with the following requirements:
(1)
Subdivision corner tie. At least one corner of the subdivision shall be designated by course and distance (tie) from a readily discernible reference marker. If a corner is within 2,000 feet of a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Station, U.S. Geological Survey or state grid system coordinated monument, then this corner shall be marked with a monument so designated by computed X and Y coordinates which shall appear on the map with a statement identifying this station or monument to an accuracy of 1:10,000. When such a monument or station is not available, the tie shall be made to some permanent and readily recognizable landmark or identifiable point, physical object or structure. In subdivisions of more than ten lots, the information for this corner tie shall include elevation above sea level making it in effect a benchmark which can be used to determine if individual lots are in a floodprone area.
(2)
Monuments.
a.
Monuments shall be located in the ground at all angles in the boundaries of the subdivision; at the intersection lines of streets and at the intersections of the lines of streets with boundaries of the plat and at the intersection of alleys with the boundaries of the subdivision; at all points of curvature, points in the side lines of streets and alleys; and at all angles of an intermediate traverse line.
b.
It is not intended or required that monuments be placed within the traveled portion of a street to mark angles in the boundary of the subdivision if the angle points can be readily reestablished by reference to monuments along the side lines of the streets.
c.
All required monuments shall be placed flush with the ground where practicable.
d.
If the required location of a monument is in an inaccessible place, or where the location of a monument would be clearly impracticable, it is sufficient to place a reference monument nearby and the precise location thereof shall be clearly indicated on the plat and referenced to the true point.
e.
All monuments used shall be made of a minimum of solid iron or steel bars at least one-half inch in diameter and 24 inches long.
f.
If a point required to be monumented is on a bedrock outcropping, a steel rod at least one-half inch in diameter shall be drilled and grouted into solid rock to a depth of at least eight inches.
(3)
Control corners. Within each block of a subdivision at least two monuments designed and designated as control corners shall be installed. All control corners shall be constructed of concrete and shall be at least four inches in diameter or square and not less than three feet in length. Each monument shall have imbedded in its top or attached by a suitable means, a metal plate of noncorrosive materials and marked plainly with the point, the surveyor's registration number, the month and year it was installed and the words "control corner."
(4)
Property marker. A steel or wrought iron pipe or the equivalent not less than one-half inch in diameter and at least 24 inches in length shall set all corners, except those located by monuments.
(5)
Accuracy. Land surveys, both within the limits of incorporated areas and beyond shall be at an accuracy of at least 1:7,500.
