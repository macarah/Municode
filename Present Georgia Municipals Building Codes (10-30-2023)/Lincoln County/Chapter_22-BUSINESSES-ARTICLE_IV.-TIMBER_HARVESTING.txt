Repair such damage at his or its own expense with the approval and supervision of the Governing Authority of Lincoln County or its designee. When repairs are completed to the satisfaction of the governing authority or its designee, the governing authority or its designee shall provide a written notification of satisfactory completion within five business days to the responsible person or firm and to the surety issuing the bond or the bank issuing the letter of credit, thereby terminating the claim.

Any such appeal shall toll the 30 day period, or any extension thereof, required by section 22-107 of this article. If the Magistrate Court rules in favor of the person or firm against whom the claim was made, the county shall have no right to recover any proceeds of the bond or letter of credit, and judgment shall be entered against the county. If the Magistrate Court rules in favor of the county the court shall determine the amount of damages to which the county is entitled to recover and enter judgment accordingly; the Governing Authority of Lincoln County shall be authorized to call the bond or letter of credit and recover from the proceeds thereof an amount equal to the judgment entered by the court, up to the total amount of the bond or letter of credit. The portion of any judgment entered in favor of the county that exceeds the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be subject to collection by any additional remedies at law or equity.
