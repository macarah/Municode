ARTICLE XV: - LIGHT MANUFACTURING DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

Section 1: - Purpose and Intent
The Light Manufacturing zoning district is intended to establish and preserve physically and aesthetically desirable areas in which clean, low-intensity manufacturing activities may locate and be protected from the intrusion of incompatible land uses. By having such areas available, both new and existing industries may operate and undertake expansion of facilities with the least possible adverse effect on other types of activities which might be incompatible with manufacturing. The elimination of non-manufacturing activities from this district benefits manufacturing activities by removing obstacles to smooth operation and expansion.
