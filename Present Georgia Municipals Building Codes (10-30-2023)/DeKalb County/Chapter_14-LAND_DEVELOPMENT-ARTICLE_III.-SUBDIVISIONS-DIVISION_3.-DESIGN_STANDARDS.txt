Sec. 14-189.1. - Traffic improvements, street improvements, curb cuts, visibility requirements, and private street construction standards.
(a)
Each building shall be located on a lot or parcel that abuts a public street or private street. Private streets shall only be allowed if the development seeking to have a private street(s) is ten (10) acres or larger in size. The planning commission shall have the authority to waive this minimum acreage requirement if all real property owners that abut the proposed private street agree to such waiver.
(b)
Where this chapter measures minimum building setback lines and frontages, or imposes development standards in connection with, or with reference to public streets, such measurements or standards set forth in the district regulations and supplemental regulations of chapter 27, in this chapter or elsewhere in the Code of DeKalb County shall apply similarly for property abutting a private street where such private street has been approved by the planning commission. Nothing in this article is intended to authorize any kind of development on a private street that would not be authorized where there was public right of way.
(c)
Private streets within any zoning district shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements of the Code. Private streets within any district shall be assigned names and locations. The names of these streets shall be shown on plans required for the issuance of building and development permits as provided in this chapter and chapters 7 and 27 of the Code of DeKalb County. The geographical information services department shall approve all private street names and addresses, thereby avoiding conflicting names and addresses.
(d)
Lots may front on a public street or private street constructed to the standards found in this chapter.
(e)
Where sewer lines are constructed underneath a private street, the developer is required to grant an easement to the county for installation, maintenance and repair of such sewer lines.

Private streets shall not be eligible for participation in the county's traffic calming program as provided for in chapter 17 of this Code.
(g)
Private streets shall not be eligible for participation in the county's residential sidewalk district program as provided for in chapter 23 of this Code.
(h)
Developers and property owners' associations shall ensure access to all private streets by emergency and law enforcement vehicles and shall ensure that private streets are constructed to allow access by all emergency vehicles and law enforcement vehicles.
(i)
The use of private streets may not result in an increase in permitted density above that which would otherwise be permitted by the applicable district regulations. Density calculations shall be made based on a public street system and the preliminary plat that provides for a private street shall be density neutral Additionally, a utility easement(s) is not to be included in any plat as a part of an individual lot and thus such land that comprises the utility easement(s) cannot be used to calculate the required minimum lot size, or minimum front yard size.
(j)
Private streets shall comply with requirements for public streets found in this chapter and all other applicable sections of the Code of DeKalb County. Private streets shall be surfaced with the same type of materials that are used by the county's department of public works for the surfacing and resurfacing of public streets or with materials that are as protective as those used by the county to surface and resurface streets so long as such alternative materials are approved by the director of public works.

(b)
If the private street is to be located in a historic district as that term is defined in chapter 13.5 of this Code, then the applicant must provide the planning commission with a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the private street from the historic preservation commission. If no such certificate of appropriateness is provided to the planning commission then the planning commission shall deny the application for a private street.
(c)
Street rights-of-way shall be owned by the mandatory homeowners' association as required by section 14-189.3. Street rights-of-way shall comply with all the requirements set forth in this Code, including but not limited to the requirements set forth in this chapter and in chapter 27 of this Code. An access easement and a utility easement shall entirely overlay the rights-of-way and shall be dedicated to the county for public use.

Maintenance of private streets.
(1)
Each developer that chooses to include private streets within a condominium, as that term is defined by state law, or any other residential, commercial, institutional, industrial or office development shall organize and establish a property owners' association prior to recording of the final plat. Membership in the property owners' association shall be mandatory for each original and successive purchaser of a lot, building or unit within the development. The property owners' association shall be organized so that it has clear legal authority to maintain and exercise control over the private street(s) and required improvements associated with private streets, including, but not limited to, sidewalks, bikeways, curbs and gutters, traffic signs and markings, associated landscaping and lighting, entry signs, monuments, perimeter walls and fences, entry gates and gatehouses. The declaration of covenants creating the property owners' association shall be recorded with the clerk of the superior court of the county and the recorded declaration of covenants and articles of incorporation creating the property owners' association shall provide that all private streets and associated improvements are owned by the property owners' association or are held in common by the property owners within the development. Said streets shall be properly maintained and insured with no liability or maintenance responsibilities accruing to the county. The recorded declaration of covenants and articles of association shall specifically require the property owners' association to repair and maintain each private street in the same manner as similar public streets are maintained by the county and such maintenance and repair shall be performed in compliance with all county standards and all applicable provisions of law.
(2)
Prior to any final plat approval, the developer shall submit articles of incorporation, declaration of covenants and bylaws for the property owners' association to the planning department. Those documents must thereafter be reviewed and approved by the county attorney.
(b)
Maintenance fund. The declaration of covenants and articles of association shall provide for a street maintenance fund the proceeds of which shall be used solely for the purpose of regular maintenance of the street(s), whether for resurfacing or a similar purpose. For the purposes of further providing further assurance that county funds shall not be used for maintenance of private streets, the developer shall submit proof of deposit of fifty (50) percent of the current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the planning and development director or designee, in an interest bearing account on behalf of the property owners' association.
(c)
Maintenance bond At the end of the twelve-month maintenance period provided for in section 14-381, a developer must provide a maintenance bond renewable annually to cover the cost of maintenance and repair for any private streets within a subdivision. The bond shall be for an amount equal to fifty (50) percent of the current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the planning and development director or designee. The developer may avoid securing the maintenance bond set forth in this subsection if the developer submits proof to the planning department that one hundred (100) percent of the then-current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the planning and development director or designee, has been deposited in an interest-bearing account on behalf of the property owners' association. If the developer chooses this alternative, the declarations of covenants and articles of association shall specifically require the property owners' association to continuously maintain one hundred (100) percent of the then-current estimate of resurfacing costs of the private streets in this maintenance fund.
(d)
Assessment and liens. The property owners' association must be empowered to levy assessments against owners within the development for the payment of expenditures made by the association for maintenance of the private streets and other items set forth in subsection (a) herein. At least fifteen (15) percent of all fees or assessments paid shall be set aside in the maintenance fund. Any unpaid assessments shall constitute a lien in favor of the property owners' association on the lot, building or unit of the owner.
(Ord. No. 07-17, Pt. I, 7-24-07)
Sec. 14-189.4 - Inspection of private streets within nine months of approval of the final plat; failure to correct deficiencies.
(a)
Within nine (9) months following approval of the final plat, the county's development director or designee shall inspect the private street(s) to ensure compliance with all county standards and all applicable provisions of this Code including, but not limited to, the requirements set forth in law for public streets, curbs, sidewalks, signage and street lighting. The developer shall be notified of any deficiencies in writing and such deficiencies shall be corrected within sixty (60) days of the written notice of deficiencies unless the county agrees to extension of that period in writing.
(b)
Failure to correct the complete list of deficiencies shall be a violation of this section and shall subject the developer to prosecution for a code violation in the Recorders Court of DeKalb County. Any person found to have violated this section shall be subject to a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each violation. A separate and distinct offense shall be regarded as committed each day on which such person shall continue any such violation.
(c)
The planning and development department director or designee shall deny the issuance of certificates of occupancy until all deficiencies have been corrected.

(d)
Right-of-way dedication and road widening shall extend for the full length of road frontage of the property under development and shall conform the standards in these regulations. Flares at pavement ends may be required to extend beyond property under development.
(e)
The board of commissioners, after considering all related factors, may authorize deviations from this section as follows:
(1)
Right-of-way dedication may be waived or modified if:
a.
Existing use of property is not to be substantially changed as a result of proposed development or construction;
b.
Existing government construction plans for the roadway indicate lesser right-of-way would be required for dedication; or
c.
The adjoining frontage is developed and the predominate existing right-of-way meets county standards.
(2)
Road improvements may be waived or modified if:
a.
Existing use of property not to be substantially changed (i.e., traffic generation and ingress/egress would remain the same);
b.

No more than five (5) percent of average daily traffic generation would occur between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., on weekdays;
d.
The existing road meets current county standards; or
e.
Widening would create a hazard to traffic, pedestrians, or bicyclists along the thoroughfare.
(3)
The applicant may, with written concurrence of the development director and the county attorney, provide payment to the county in lieu of road improvements when:
a.
Road improvements by state or local action are scheduled within twenty-four (24) months;
b.
Existing utility companies' improvements are situated so as to require their removal or relocation before road improvements should be accomplished;
c.
