These parking requirements consider the proximity to the university and the pedestrian-oriented design within the Emory Village Overlay District. All uses not listed shall meet the parking requirements of the underlying zoning district.
Table 3.6: Standards for Off-Street Parking
EXPAND
Standards for Off-Street Parking: Emory Village District
Use Minimum Off-Street Parking Requirements
Offices uses, service uses, and retail uses Three (3) spaces per one thousand (1,000) square feet of floor area
Movie theaters and places of worship Three (3) spaces per one thousand (1,000) square feet of floor area
Food service Eight (8) spaces per one thousand (1,000) square feet of floor area
Food service with on-premises alcohol Eight (8) spaces per one thousand (1,000) square feet of floor area
Residential uses One (1) space per dwelling unit plus one-half (½) space for each dwelling unit that has more than one (1) bedroom (e.g., two (2) spaces for a three-bedroom)
  B.
To satisfy these parking requirements, parking may be located on the businesses/restaurants/residences lots and/or on other lots within the district. Shared parking between land uses within the district is encouraged and may result in permitted reductions of off-street parking requirements. Parking facilities within the district may be shared if the uses generate parking demands primarily at different times of the day or if a use has excess off-street parking capacity. Applicants may submit a plan for shared parking to the director of planning and development for authorization of shared parking. Such plans shall include:
1.
A scaled map indicating location of all proposed parking spaces;
2.
A parking demand study by a licensed professional traffic engineer that documents the hours of business operation(s) for the land uses sharing the parking during all times of operation or occupancy and during all seasons of the year. Such study shall also provide sufficient data to document the actual or projected demand for parking and indicate the actual number of spaces that must be provided to satisfy such demonstrated demand;
3.
Written consent of all property owners to the shared or off-site parking arrangement.
C.
The planning and development director or designee shall review the above documents and, based on the results of the study, may permit the reduction of the total required parking for the uses by no more than twenty (20) percent of the total. Such shared parking arrangements shall remain in force for the duration of the written consent agreement set forth in subsection (3) above. A renewed consent agreement shall be provided to the planning and development director to ensure adequate parking capacity before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted for a new use subject to the terms of the agreement. Lack of a current lease shall automatically terminate the authorization and place the applicants in violation of the zoning ordinance.
D.
Owners of accessory parking facilities that provide excess spaces beyond the minimum required to serve all on-site uses may enter into written agreements to allow said excess spaces to supply required parking for other land uses within the village center.
E.
Any change in use of a building, shop or leased area shall require compliance with the parking standards in this section to obtain a certificate of occupancy.
F.
Parking credits:
1.
Priority open space parking credit. The requirements of subsection A. shall be reduced by constructing priority open space contained within the regulating plan, subject to the following:
a.
Priority open space shall be in a natural state or landscaped. Such space shall not be used for vehicles, except for incidental service, maintenance or emergency actions.
b.
A parking credit of one (1) space for every two hundred (200) square feet of priority open space may be applied to the requirements of subsection A.
c.
Parking credits shall not be transferred off site.
d.
In no event shall the application of parking credits accrued by the provisions of this section, in combination with shared parking or any other provision of this division or other county ordinances, result in fewer parking spaces being provided than the minimum number required to satisfy actual peak projected parking demand for both residential and nonresidential uses as documented in the shared parking analysis and subject to approval by the planning director pursuant to subsection B.(2).
2.
Sidewalk credit. The requirements of subsection A. may be reduced to account for portions of private property utilized to provide the publicly accessible sidewalks identified in [section] 3.22.12, subject to the following:
a.
A parking credit of one (1) space for every two hundred (200) square feet of new sidewalk, when located on private property, shall be applied to the requirements of subsection A.
b.
Parking credits shall apply to publicly or privately funded sidewalks.
c.
Parking credits shall apply retroactively to existing publicly accessible sidewalks located on private property, and shall remain in effect for the duration thereof. This credit shall only cease when the publicly accessible sidewalk is purchased as public right-of-way. Public access easements through private property shall not cause a cessation of this credit.
d.
Parking credits shall not be transferred off site.

No application for a variance under chapter 14 or 27 shall be considered complete until such time as the historic preservation commission has had an opportunity to provide its recommendation in writing. If no written recommendation is issued within the applicable time frame, then the planning commission and the zoning board of appeals shall construe the recommendation to have been for approval. A recommendation for approval or denial of a variance by the preservation commission shall not be binding on the zoning board of appeals or the planning commission.
E.
Subdivision sketch plat approval. Sketch plat approval from the planning commission shall not require a certificate of appropriateness. The planning and development director or designee shall provide all sketch plats arising under chapter 14 of this Code to the historic preservation commission for study and investigation within five (5) business days of receipt of the application and sketch plat. The historic preservation commission shall issue its recommendation within thirty-five (35) days of the official acceptance of the application and sketch plat. No application for sketch plat approval shall be considered by the planning commission until such time as the historic preservation commission has had an opportunity to provide its recommendation in writing. If no written recommendation is issued within the applicable time frame, then the planning commission shall construe the recommendation to have been for approval. A recommendation for approval or denial of a sketch plat by the preservation commission shall not be binding on the planning commission.
