27-3.34 DIVISION 34. - DOWNTOWN TUCKER COMPATIBLE USE OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sec. 3.34.1. - Reserved.
Sec. 3.34.2. - Scope of regulations.
This division establishes standards and procedures that apply to any development, use, alteration, height, density, parking, open space, and building that lies, in whole or in part, within the Downtown Tucker Compatible Use Overlay District, hereinafter referred to as the Tucker Overlay District. The Tucker Overlay District is based upon the urban design and development guidelines included in the downtown Tucker livable centers initiative (LCI) plan.
The LCI's plan calls for a community that incorporates higher density development in the downtown Tucker area while providing a mix of commercial, office, recreation, and housing options. Also included in the LCI's goals is the improved mobility on the major corridors. Wherever the underlying zoning regulations are in conflict with the provisions of this overlay district, the regulations of this overlay district shall apply. This division shall be governed by chapter 27, article 3, division 1, section 3.37.2 of the DeKalb County Zoning Ordinance.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 3.34.3. - Applicability of regulations.
This division applies to each application for a business license, land-disturbance permit, building permit or sign permit which involves the development, use, alteration, or modification of any structure where the subject property is located in whole, or in part, within the boundaries of the Tucker Overlay District. The procedures, standards, and criteria herein apply only to that portion of the subject property within the boundaries of the Tucker Overlay District.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 3.34.4. - Statement of purpose and intent.
The purpose and intent of the board of commissioners in establishing the Tucker Overlay District is as follows:
A.
To promote the development of a more dynamic, mixed-use district of appropriate scale and magnitude in the downtown Tucker area;
B.
To ensure that new structures and developments are consistent with the vision and recommendations of the downtown Tucker LCI plan (completed in 2005) with significant community involvement and input;
C.
To provide a variety of housing types and promote mixed-income residential opportunities;
D.
To design and arrange structures, buildings, streets, and open spaces to create an inviting, walkable, human-scale environment;
E.
To provide for connectivity of streets and communities and reduce the dependence on automobile use by increasing the ease of movement and opportunities for alternative modes of travel;
F.
To ensure a proportional relationship of surrounding buildings with respect to the general spacing of structures, building mass and scale, and street frontage by using techniques to achieve compatibility, such as:
1.
Use of additional façade detail; proportion of façade elements, doorways, projections and insets; window scale and pattern; and creation of strong shadow lines as decorative elements;
2.
Use of consistent setbacks from property lines;
3.
Development of consistent sidewalks and a more active, interesting pedestrian environment;
4.
Use of landscaping, lighting and street furniture to unify district buildings and define space;
5.
Use of compatible building materials to promote a design and building aesthetic compatible with the desired urban character; and
G.
To implement the policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan and the zoning ordinance of DeKalb County within the Tucker Overlay District.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 3.34.5. - District boundaries and map.
A.
The boundaries and development categories of the Tucker Overlay District are described below and shall be established by a zoning map amendment adopted pursuant to this chapter which amendment shall be incorporated herein and made a part of this chapter:
B.
The foregoing Tucker Overlay District shall be divided into three (3) development categories:
1.
Neighborhood zone. The intent of the neighborhood zone is to preserve the residential neighborhood character and uses while allowing mixed use and commercial uses along the major roads within the district. This neighborhood character shall be guided by residential architecture such as pitched roofs, smaller scale, fenestration, cornices, columns, etc. The height in this district should be compatible to residential structures.
2.
Corridor zone. The intent of the corridor zone is to encourage mixed-use-type development along Lawrenceville Highway and LaVista Road that creates a more aesthetically pleasing and pedestrian friendly environment. Commercial, office, residential and multifamily mixed-use-type developments are desired. Although a mixture of uses is allowed, multifamily, townhouse, condominium and loft-type structures are preferred. The orientation of any development shall be toward Lawrenceville Highway and LaVista Road; however access can be from the rear.
3.
Village zone. The intent of the village zone is to revitalize Main Street and create a well-defined core area for the downtown Tucker area. Mixed-use-type development with commercial, residential, and office uses is encouraged to help create the downtown, Main Street atmosphere. Additionally, the intent of the Tucker Overlay District is to incorporate the varying institutional uses such as churches, schools, public buildings, public squares/plazas, and government uses into the character of the district. The urban character of this district shall be guided by zero setbacks, urban edges, and common architectural themes, continuation of architectural rhythms, and building materials and massing.
C.
The planning and development director or designee shall have the final authority to determine whether any property is located within the boundaries of this section.
