The purpose and intent of the board of commissioners in establishing all districts designated as Mixed-Use (MU-1, MU-2, MU-3, MU-4 and MU-5) Zoning Districts are as follows:
1.
To encourage the development of master or comprehensively planned, mixed-use developments;
2.
To permit flexible and compatible arrangements of residential, commercial, office, institutional, and civic uses;
3.
To offer a variety of housing options, including multi-family residential and single-family attached housing of various densities, upper-floor residential units over non-residential space, or active adult and/or senior housing;
4.
To implement the future development map of the county's most current comprehensive plan;
5.
To maintain harmony of scale, intensity, and design of character areas with varying housing options;
6.
To accommodate and promote mixed-use buildings with amenities and services provided by a variety of non-residential uses, as appropriate in the activity centers established by the comprehensive plan;
7.
To promote the health and well-being of residents through the development of living environments that accommodate pedestrians and bicyclists;
8.
To encourage a sense of community through design that promotes social interaction; and
9.
To reduce automobile traffic and congestion and promote the use of transit by encouraging appropriate development densities.
