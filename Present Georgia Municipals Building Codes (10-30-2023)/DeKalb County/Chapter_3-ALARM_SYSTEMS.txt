This article is not intended to create new or to expand existing, if any, legal obligations of the county. The registration fees set forth in this article are intended to require alarm system owners and alarm system companies to bear some of the cost of fire and police responses to all alarms system calls. The assessments set forth in this ordinance [from which this article is derived] are intended to ensure compliance with this article to defray a portion of the cost of false alarms, and to help reduce the number of false alarms.

An alarm system may consist of one (1) or more components (e.g., motion detector, window breach detector, or similar components) all reporting to a central unit/system panel which, in turn, is connected or reports to an alarm system company, or constitutes a non-monitored alarm system, i.e., a system that does not transmit a message or signal to an alarm system company.

Executive assistant means the individual or his/her designee occupying the position of executive assistant as defined in section 14 of the Organizational Act of DeKalb County.

This definition includes, but is not limited to, any alarm system activated as a result of weather, negligence, accident, mechanical failure, electrical failure, or electrical surge.

(c)
The alarm system was activated by an attempted illegal entry of which there is some evidence.
