ARTICLE XII. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS

Sec. 15-400. - Findings; public purpose.
(a)
Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments on the community in the findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Cleveland, Ohio; findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who appeared before the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners at a hearing conducted in 1991, and public hearing on the Revised Alcoholic Beverage Ordinance held on March 10, 1998 and April 14, 1998, the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners that adult entertainment establishments, as defined herein, are often associated with criminal behavior and tend to contribute to undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with adult entertainment establishments are disorderly conduct, prostitution, drug trafficking, and drug use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with adult entertainment establishments are depression of property values in the surrounding neigh-borhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described above, and the acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Furthermore, the public health, safety, and welfare require that adult entertainment establishments and their locations, operations, and employees be regulated and licensed in order to reduce the potential for harm and in order to preserve the quality of urban life in residential and business areas of the community. Therefore, the limitation of adult entertainment establishments to certain prescribed areas of the community is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses.
(b)
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse effect on property values and on the public health, safety, and welfare of the county, on its citizens and property, and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally-protected forms of expression. This article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reducing criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments while protecting the rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. This article is not intended to allow or license any business establishment or activity that would otherwise be unlawful.
