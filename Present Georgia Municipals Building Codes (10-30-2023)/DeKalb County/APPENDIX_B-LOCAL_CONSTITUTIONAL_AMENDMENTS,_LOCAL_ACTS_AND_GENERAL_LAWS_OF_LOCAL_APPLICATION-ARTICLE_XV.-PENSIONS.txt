Sec. 901. - Definitions.
Officers, employees and deputies, as the terms are used herein, shall include elected county officials, officers and employees of DeKalb County, employees and deputies of county officers by whatever name or title employed or deputized, and all other persons including officers and employees of the county who perform any service for the benefit of DeKalb County for which they are paid a salary, including part-time employees, regular employees, deputies and elected officials who are not contributing to any other pension plan of the State of Georgia or any institution, bureau or department thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this act [article], in the event DeKalb County, along with the State of Georgia or any institution, bureau or department thereof, contributes to the salary of any aforesaid officer, employee or deputy, such officer, employee or deputy may participate in the county retirement system but only to the extent of that participant's county paid salary and, in such case, only the county paid portion of such salary shall be considered compensation for the purpose of determining benefits and payment of contributions under this act [article].
In the event DeKalb County, along with the State of Georgia, contributes to the salaries of the officers, deputies and employees aforesaid, and such person is under the system of pension and retirement pay for officers, deputies and employees of DeKalb County as of January 1, 1971, the total salaries of said officer, employee or deputy from all such sources shall be counted as compensation for the purpose of determining benefits and payment of contributions. DeKalb County shall withhold monthly the required contribution by said employee to the pension fund as outlined in this act [article] for such amounts of income; and it is further provided that DeKalb County shall pay into the pension fund the employer's contribution for the total amount of said income at the rate required under this act [article].
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this act, with regard to any DeKalb County State Court judge that participates in a retirement plan of the State of Georgia, if such judge's yearly salary exceeds the amount allowed by law to be applied toward a state retirement plan, then the judge may participate in the county retirement system, but only to the extent of the portion of such judge's salary that exceeds the salary allowed by law to be applied toward the state retirement system (hereinafter referred to as "additional salary") and, in such case, only the additional salary shall be considered compensation for the purpose of determining benefits and payments of contributions under this act. Any judge to whom this paragraph applies may be entitled to credit against his service for all periods of time his salary as a state court judge exceeded that allowed by law to be applied toward a state retirement plan, provided such judge shall restore to the pension fund all sums that would have been deducted from the additional salary as pension contributions, together with interest thereon at the rate of eight (8) percent per annum. Said sum may be paid in equal installments over a period not to exceed twenty-four (24) months; provided, however, should such judge become eligible for county pension benefits before this amount is fully paid, the amount due the pension fund by such judge shall be deducted from such benefits at a rate to be determined by the pension board. Nothing in this section 901 shall be interpreted to mean that any current or former participant of this plan may opt out of participation in this plan after he has made his first contribution. When and if a judge or other officer, employee or deputy who is receiving or will receive payments of salary from DeKalb County and the State of Georgia (or any institution, bureau or department thereof) first becomes eligible to participate in this plan, that individual may make a one-time irrevocable election to opt out of participation in this plan, but may do so only before he makes his first contribution.
Beginning as of June 26, 2013, the terms 'spouse' and 'surviving spouse' as those terms are used herein, mean the individual to whom a participant is lawfully married under the laws of any state or other jurisdiction where the marriage was performed, without regard to gender or the state of residence. 'Spouse' or 'surviving spouse' shall not include domestic partners or other similar relationships that do not satisfy a state or other jurisdictional requirement for a legal marriage.

Provided however, that the director of finance and the director of the merit system shall not have the power to vote on any issue before the pension board at any time. Vacancies occurring in positions shall be filled for the unexpired terms in the same manner as they were originally filled. A duly elected officer, employee or deputy member of the pension board, shall cease being a member of such board when the individual is no longer an active officer, employee or deputy of DeKalb County.

Sec. 908. - Payment of benefits.
(a)
Definitions:
(1)
Compensation shall mean the actual compensation paid as salary to a participant by the county as herein provided during any calendar month, exclusive of overtime pay, reimbursed expenses, bonuses, commissions, and any other remuneration. Any increase in the annual compensation limit is effective as of January 1 of a calendar year and applies to any plan year beginning in that calendar year. Beginning after December 31, 1993, only the first one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) of compensation shall be taken into account (and beginning January 1, 1995, such other amount as may be determined under IRC 401(a)(17)(B)).
Beginning January 1, 2002, in no event shall the compensation of a participant taken into account under the plan for any plan year exceed the limitations of IRC Section 401(a)(17) in effect as of the beginning of the plan year (e.g., $250,000.00 for 2012). The limitations set forth herein shall be subject to adjustment as provided in IRC Section 401(a)(17)(B) and IRC Section 415(d); provided, however, that the dollar increase in effect on April 1 of each plan year, if any, is effective for that plan year.

Average compensation shall be determined by dividing the total compensation received by the participant during this thirty-six (36) complete calendar months-period by the number of months for which he received compensation in such period. When identifying the "ten (10) years of service" and the "highest thirty-six (36) consecutive complete calendar months" referenced above, any calendar month in which the compensation a participant received was reduced or eliminated because of an unpaid period at least fourteen consecutive days in length (or any portion of such an unpaid period) shall be disregarded as if that calendar month had not occurred; calendar months immediately preceding and following such disregarded calendar months shall be deemed consecutive. Compensation the participant received during any such disregarded calendar month(s) shall not be counted when calculating average compensation. The definition of average compensation shall be the same for a group 3 participant as for a group 1 or group 2 participant, except that the average compensation for a group 3 participant who continues working as an officer, employee, or deputy of DeKalb County after reaching thirty (30) years of service under this plan shall be calculated as if the participant's employment with the county had terminated when he reached thirty (30) years of service under this plan.
(4)

Years of service for which a participant shall have credit after a period of discontinuation of benefits shall include years of service prior the participant's original retirement, in addition to any service credited for postretirement employment. No service credit shall be given for any period of postretirement employment during which a participant received benefits under this plan and/or made no pension contributions.
(7)
Actuarial equivalent shall mean a benefit calculated to be of equal value to the benefit otherwise payable when computed on the basis of the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table at seven (7) percent interest, factors prorated based upon seventy-five (75) percent males and twenty-five (25) percent females. For the purposes of calculating early retirement adjustments to IRC Section 415 limitations or for converting a benefit payable as an optional form of payment, the actuarial equivalent shall be computed based on the applicable interest rate and applicable mortality table as prescribed under IRC Section 415.
(8)
Plan year shall mean the twelve-month period beginning each January 1 and ending on the following December 31, effective January 1, 2018. There shall be a short plan year from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.

B.
Disability retirement date. An eligible participant's disability retirement date shall be the first day of the month after a determination by the pension board that the participant is totally disabled in accordance with the definition and procedure set forth in section 913 of this appendix.
C.
Disability retirement benefit. An eligible participant who qualifies for disability retirement shall, beginning on his disability retirement date, receive a monthly retirement benefit equal to fifty (50) percent (for a group 1 or group 2 participant) or twenty (20) percent (for a group 3 participant) of the participant's monthly rate of earnings as of the date last worked, minus any benefits received, including lump sum payments, and any benefit to be received through workers' compensation from DeKalb County, but the pension shall not be less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month.

Recalculation of the participant's monthly retirement benefit at or after the normal retirement date as provided for below.
D.
Transition from disability retirement benefit to normal retirement benefit.
(i)
For group 1 and group 2 participants. If a group 1 or group 2 participant reaches his normal retirement date while receiving disability retirement benefits, he may elect to begin receiving normal retirement benefits instead of disability retirement benefits. If a participant makes this election, his benefit shall be recalculated in the same manner a normal retirement benefit is calculated, based upon the participant's average compensation as of his disability retirement date and years of service earned as of his normal retirement date. This recalculation may cause the participant's monthly benefit amount to increase or to decrease. When the participant elects to begin receiving normal retirement benefits, he may elect to receive benefits under one of the optional forms of payment described in subsection (b)(5) of this section 908. In the event that a group 1 or group 2 participant is still receiving disability retirement benefits at age sixty-five (65), the participant's monthly benefit shall automatically be recalculated in the same manner as a normal retirement benefit, based upon his average compensation as of his disability retirement date and years of service earned as of his normal retirement date, and the participant may elect to receive benefits under one of the optional forms of payment described in subsection (b)(5) of this section 908. However, when a group 1 or group 2 participant's benefit is automatically recalculated at age sixty-five (65), the participant's monthly retirement benefit shall not be reduced to an amount less than the monthly disability retirement benefit the participant was receiving immediately before age sixty-five (65), except to the extent such a reduction results solely from an election under subsection (b)(5) of this section 908.
(ii)
For group 3 participants. If a group 3 participant is still receiving disability retirement benefits when he reaches age sixty-seven (67), his monthly benefit shall automatically be recalculated as a normal retirement benefit and he may elect to receive benefits under one of the optional forms of payment described in subsection (b)(5) of this section 908. However, the participant's monthly retirement benefit shall not be reduced to an amount that is less than the monthly disability retirement benefit the participant was receiving immediately before age sixty-seven (67), except to the extent such a reduction results solely from an election made under subsection (b)(5) of this section 908.
E.
Requirement of post-offer, pre-employment physical. All individuals who receive offers of employment (which may be conditional offers) to become new officers, employees or deputies of DeKalb County under this plan shall undergo and complete a physical examination given by a physician chosen or approved by DeKalb County prior to the beginning of such employment, to determine whether they meet the minimum medical standards required to perform the essential functions of the offered job position (with reasonable accommodation if needed for a disability).
(5)
[Optional retirement benefits.]
A.
Election of optional retirement benefits. A participant may elect, or may revoke a previous election and make a new election, at any time six (6) months prior to his normal retirement date, early retirement date, or delayed retirement date, to have the benefit provided in subsection 1.B. of this section converted to one (1) of the options hereinafter set forth. Election of any option shall be made by the participant in writing. The one hundred twenty (120) months guaranteed payments provided in subsection 1.B. of this section is the normal form of payment for a normal, early or delayed retirement and shall be payable unless one of the following optional forms of payment is elected. Election of any option shall be made by the participant in writing. The benefit provided in subsection 1.A.(b) and 1.B. of this section 8 shall not be subject to election, but shall be payable only in the manner stated in said subsection 1.A.(b) and 1.B.
B.
Description of options. The amount of any optional retirement benefit set forth below shall be the actuarial equivalent of the retirement benefit the participant would otherwise have been entitled to receive in accordance with paragraph 1.B. of this section, subject to the reduction in paragraph 3.B. of this section, if applicable.
OPTION 1. Straight life benefit. This option provides an actuarially increased benefit which shall be payable during the lifetime of the participant with all payments ceasing at his death.
OPTION 2. Joint and survivor benefit. This option provides an actuarially reduced benefit payable to the participant during his lifetime, with payments to continue after his death to his joint annuitant in an amount which is fifty (50) percent, sixty-six and two thirds (66⅔) percent, seventy-five (75) percent or one hundred (100) percent of the participant's monthly retirement benefit, as elected by the participant upon his retirement, until the death of the joint annuitant. In the event the joint annuitant predeceases the retired participant, benefit payments shall cease upon the death of the participant.
(6)
[Election under Option 2.]
A.
Joint annuitant. A participant who elects Option 2 shall, on a form provided for that purpose, designate a person to receive the benefits which continue to be payable upon the death of the participant. Such person shall be the joint annuitant of the participant.
B.
Cancellation of election. The election by a participant of Option 2 shall be null and void if either the participant or his designated joint annuitant shall die before benefits commence. In the event this election becomes null and void, the participant shall have the right to name another joint annuitant or elect another option in which instance the six (6) months' requirement of subsection 5.A. shall be waived.
C.
Increase of benefit. In the event the joint annuitant predeceases the retired participant on or after the effective date of this ordinance, monthly benefit payments to the retired participant shall be increased thereafter to the benefit the participant would otherwise have been entitled to receive in accordance with paragraph 5.B. Option 1. of this section, subject to the reduction in paragraph 3.B. of this section, if applicable. Benefit payments shall cease upon the death of the participant.
(7)
Termination benefit.
A.
Termination benefit for participants who terminate employment on or before March 25, 1992. In the event of termination of employment within the first three (3) years of service, the participant's contributions will be returned without interest. Upon termination of employment after three (3) years of service but less than ten (10) years, the participant may either withdraw his contributions plus interest or leave his contributions in the fund and receive a monthly benefit to commence at age sixty-five (65) equal to the accrued benefit determined as of his date of termination. Upon termination of employment after the completion of ten (10) years of service the participant may either withdraw his contributions plus interest or leave his contributions in the fund and receive a monthly benefit to commence at his normal retirement date equal to the accrued benefit determined as of his date of termination; provided, however, such terminating employee may elect to commence receiving actuarially reduced benefits any time after he attains fifty (50) years of age.
B.
Termination benefit for participants who terminate employment after March 25, 1992.
(i)
For group 1 participants. In the event of termination of employment within the first three (3) years of service, the participant's contributions will be returned to the participant without interest within ninety (90) days of termination by means of a check mailed to the last known address of the participant or delivered by other means at the written request of the participant. Upon completing three (3) or more years of service, the participant is one hundred (100) percent vested in his benefit under the plan. In the event of termination of employment after three (3) or more years of service, the participant's contribution plus interest will be returned to the participant within ninety (90) days of termination by means of a check mailed to the last known address of the participant or delivered by other means at the written request of the participant, unless the participant, prior to the transmittal of such check, elects in writing to leave the contributions in the fund and to receive a monthly benefit to commence at a specific age after he becomes eligible to receive benefits. Except as provided in Section 15 of this Act regarding credit for prior service, any participant who receives a return of contributions shall be ineligible for a pension, except that in the case of a participant with three (3) or more years of service who receives an unrequested return of contributions, such participant may restore eligibility for a pension if, within sixty (60) days of receipt of same, the participant returns the full amount of the contributions and interest and provides to the pension board a written statement setting forth the date as of which the participant intends to retire. Any election of a date of intent to retire may be changed by the participant at any time by writing to the clerk of the pension board and expressing a revised date of intent to retire, subject to the provisions of this Act governing retirement dates. Expression of intent to retire confirms the participant's desire to leave contributions in the pension fund, and it shall not constitute an application for retirement. A refund of unforfeited contributions plus applicable interest may be requested at any time prior to the pension-eligible participant receiving monthly retirement benefits.
(ii)
For group 2 and group 3 participants. The terms and conditions in [subsection] 7.B.(i) above shall apply to group 2 and group 3 participants, except that:
(a)
In the event of termination of employment after at least three (3) but less than seven (7) years of service, the participant's contributions plus interest will be returned to the participant within ninety (90) days of termination by means of a check mailed to the last known address of the participant or delivered by other means at the written request of the participant;
(b)
The participant is one hundred (100) percent vested in his benefit under the plan only after completing seven (7) or more years of service;
(c)
In the event of termination of employment after at least seven (7) years of service, the participant's contributions plus interest will be returned to the participant within ninety (90) days of termination by means of a check mailed to the last known address of the participant or delivered by other means at the written request of the participant, unless the participant, prior to the transmittal of such check, elects in writing to leave the contributions in the fund and to receive a monthly benefit to commence at a specific age after he becomes eligible to receive benefits; and
(d)
Except as provided in Section 15 of this Act regarding credit for prior service, any participant who receives a return of contributions shall be ineligible for a pension, except that in the case of a participant with seven (7) or more years of service who receives an unrequested return of contributions, such participant may restore eligibility for a pension if, within sixty (60) days of receipt of same, the participant returns the full amount of the contributions and interest and provides to the pension board a written statement setting forth the date as of which the participant intends to retire.
C.
Payments over one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Effective as to distributions that occur on and after March 28, 2005, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, if (1) the termination benefit pursuant to this section is more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), and (2) the participant does not affirmatively elect to receive the distribution directly or to have such distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan in accordance with the requirements of section 8 (section 908(b)(12) of this Appendix), then the plan will pay the distribution in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the pension board that can account separately for taxable and non-taxable amounts.
(8)
Death benefit.
A.
Preretirement death benefit for group 1 participants. If a group 1 participant who has not retired dies prior to completing ten (10) years of service, his beneficiary shall receive a lump sum benefit equal to the participant's contributions plus interest. If a group 1 participant who has not retired dies after ten (10) years or more of service, the participant's beneficiary may elect to receive as a benefit one of the following forms of benefit, subject to the minimum distribution requirements in subsection (b)(11). The normal form in which this plan pays a participant's accrued benefit is a monthly benefit payable during the lifetime of the participant, with a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) guaranteed payments to the participant or his beneficiary. If a participant dies after ten (10) years or more of service but before receiving any portion of his accrued benefit, his beneficiary will receive a death benefit having an actuarial equivalent value equal to the one hundred twenty (120) guaranteed payments that would have been made to the deceased participant if he had survived and received payment(s) on the same date(s) as the beneficiary. Since the preretirement death benefit has an actuarial equivalent value equal to the deceased participant's one hundred twenty (120) guaranteed monthly payments, a beneficiary whose life expectancy is less than one hundred twenty (120) months will receive payments over a fewer number of months and in a greater monthly amount than a beneficiary whose life expectancy is at least one hundred twenty (120) months.
i.
If the participant's beneficiary is the surviving spouse, the spouse may elect to receive either:
I.
One hundred twenty (120) monthly payments (or fewer number of payments equal to the spouse's life expectancy) in an amount equal to the monthly payment the participant would have been entitled to receive had he qualified to take and had taken early retirement as of the date of his death, or if applicable in a greater monthly amount to take into account the fewer number of months of the spouse's life expectancy. The computation of such monthly benefit shall include, without limitation, the reduction applicable in computing early retirement benefits of one-eighth (⅛) of one (1) percent for each complete month, if any, by which his date of death precedes his normal retirement date. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to authorize early retirement for any participant under age fifty (50), or otherwise, except in strict accordance with the provisions of this section 8 [908 of this appendix] governing early retirement.
II.
A joint and survivor benefit, as set forth in (b)5.B. of this section 8 [908 of this appendix], equal to one hundred (100) percent of the participant's monthly joint and survivor retirement benefit, deferred until the participant would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, and calculated as if the participant had retired the day before his death. If the participant dies before reaching the age of fifty-five (55), then the surviving spouse shall elect whether to receive normal or early retirement as set forth in [subsection] (b)3. of this section 8 [908 of this appendix]. If the surviving spouse elects early retirement, then the spouse will be entitled to the joint and survivor benefit if the participant had reached the age of fifty (50) or, if the participant died prior to reaching the age of fifty (50), when the participant would have attained the age of fifty (50). If the surviving spouse elects normal retirement, then the spouse will be entitled to the joint and survivor benefit when the participant would have attained the age of fifty-five (55). No payments will be made after the spouse dies.
ii.
If the participant's beneficiary is not the surviving spouse, the beneficiary may elect to receive either:
I.
A lump sum benefit in an amount equal to the actuarial present value of the one hundred twenty (120) guaranteed payments that would have been made to the deceased participant if he had survived, had been qualified to begin and had begun payments on the same date that the beneficiary receives the lump sum, which shall be paid no later than the end of the fifth year following the participant's year of death. If the participant died before he reached his early retirement date, the lump sum death benefit will be reduced using the reduction applicable in computing early retirement benefits for the period between the date he would have reached his early retirement date and the date he would have reached his normal retirement date, and reduced by an actuarial equivalent reduction for the period between the date the lump sum is paid and the date the participant would have reached his early retirement date.
II.
One hundred twenty (120) monthly payments (or fewer number of payments equal to the spouse's life expectancy determined as of the first day of the year following the participant's year of death) in an amount equal to the monthly payment the participant would have been entitled to receive if he had survived, had been qualified to begin and had begun payments on the same date that the beneficiary begins the payments; payments will begin by the end of the calendar year following the participant's year of death. If the participant died before he reached his early retirement date, the monthly death benefit will be reduced using the reduction applicable in computing early retirement benefits for the period between the date he would have reached his early retirement date and the date he would have reached his normal retirement date, and reduced by an actuarial equivalent reduction for the period between the date monthly death benefits begin and the date the participant would have reached his early retirement date. Since the preretirement death benefit has an actuarial equivalent value equal to the deceased participant's one hundred twenty (120) guaranteed monthly payments, a beneficiary whose life expectancy is less than one hundred twenty (120) months will receive payments over a fewer number of months and in a greater monthly amount than would be received by a beneficiary whose life expectancy is at least one hundred twenty (120) months.
The benefits described in this paragraph shall be in lieu of any termination benefit under this section 8 [908 of this appendix].
B.
Preretirement death benefit for group 2 and 3 participants. The death benefit for a group 2 or 3 participant shall be subject to the same terms and conditions in subparagraph (A) above, except that if the participant has not retired and dies after ten (10) years or more of service, the participant's beneficiary may elect to receive as a benefit one of the following:
i.
If the participant's surviving spouse is the beneficiary, the spouse may elect to receive either:
I.
One hundred twenty (120) monthly payments (or fewer number of payments equal to the spouse's life expectancy) in an amount equal to the monthly payment the participant would have been entitled to receive had he qualified to take and had taken early retirement as of the date of his death, or if applicable in a greater monthly amount to take into account the fewer number of months of the spouse's life expectancy. The computation of such monthly benefit shall include, without limitation, the reduction applicable in computing early retirement benefits of five-twelfths ( 5/12 ) of one percent for each complete month, if any, by which his date of death precedes his normal retirement date (if a group 2 participant) or thirteen forty-eighths ( 13/48 ) of one percent for each complete month, if any, by which his date of death precedes his normal retirement date (if a group 3 participant). Nothing contained herein shall be construed to authorize early retirement for any group 2 or group 3 participant under age fifty-five (55), or otherwise, except in strict accordance with the provisions of this section 8 [908 of this appendix] governing early retirement.
II.
A joint and survivor benefit, as set forth in [subsection] (b)5.B. of this section 8 [908 of this appendix] equal to one hundred (100) percent of the participant's monthly joint and survivor retirement benefit, deferred until the participant would have been eligible for early or normal retirement and calculated as if the participant had retired the day before his death. If the participant dies before reaching his normal retirement date, then the surviving spouse shall elect whether to receive normal or early retirement as set forth in [subsection] (b)3. of this section 8 [908 of this appendix]. If the surviving spouse elects early retirement, then the spouse will be entitled to the joint and survivor benefit if the participant had reached the age of fifty-five (55) or, if the participant died prior to reaching the age of fifty-five (55), when the participant would have attained the age of fifty-five (55). If the surviving spouse elects normal retirement, then the spouse will be entitled to the joint and survivor benefit when the participant would have attained the age of sixty-two (62) (if a group 2 participant) or age sixty-seven (67) (if a group 3 participant). No payments will be made after the spouse dies.
ii.
If the participant's beneficiary is not the surviving spouse, the plan will pay the death benefit in accordance with the rules described above in subsection (A)(ii).
The benefits described in this paragraph shall be in lieu of any termination benefit under this section 8 [908 of this appendix].
C.
After retirement. If a participant has elected the straight life option, his beneficiary shall receive a lump sum benefit equal to the excess, if any, of the participant's contributions accumulated to his retirement date plus interest over the benefits actually paid to date of death. If a participant has elected any other form of payment, death benefits shall be payable as provided for by the provisions of the option elected, but in no event shall total benefits paid be less than the participant's contributions accumulated to his retirement date plus interest.
(9)
Beneficiary. All participants shall, on a form provided for that purpose, designate a person or persons to receive the benefits payable in the event of the death of the participant. Such person or persons shall be the beneficiary of the participant.
The participant may from time to time change the beneficiary by written notice to the pension board, and upon the receipt by the pension board of such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefit under this plan shall cease. In the event that any participant shall die without having designated a beneficiary or in the event that a participant shall die but the beneficiary designated by said participant shall fail to survive the participant, then and in either event, the person who shall constitute the beneficiary of the deceased participant shall be determined as follows:
(a)
In the event the deceased participant is survived by his or her spouse, then such surviving spouse shall be the beneficiary;
(b)
If the deceased participant is not survived by his or her spouse then the beneficiary shall be the deceased participant's estate.
(10)
Maximum benefits.
A.
Benefits with respect to a participant may not exceed the maximum benefits specified under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code for governmental plans. This section does not constitute an election under Section 415(b)(10)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
B.
General rule. The annual benefit under this plan payable to a participant at any time shall not exceed the maximum permissible amount. "Maximum permissible amount" shall mean the amount specified in IRC, Section 415(b), as adjusted automatically by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from time to time, with each new limitation to apply to limitation years ending within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment.
If the annual benefit commences before age sixty-two (62) or after age sixty-five (65), the maximum permissible amount shall be determined under IRC Section 415 and regulations and rulings thereunder. If the annual benefit commences when the participant has less than ten (10) years of participation in this plan or any predecessor plan to this plan, the maximum permissible amount as defined above shall be reduced by one-tenth ( 1/10 ) for each year less than ten (10) in accordance with applicable regulations.
C.
Incorporation by reference. The limits described in subsection A. above shall be applied under the terms of IRC Section 415 and the regulations thereunder, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. For purposes of applying such limitations, the following optional provisions shall apply:
(a)
The limitation year shall be the calendar year.
(b)
A year of service for purposes of calculating a participant's average compensation shall be the calendar year.
(c)
"Compensation" shall mean a participant's earned income, wages, salaries, and fees for professional services, and other amounts received for personal services actually rendered in the course of employment as a DeKalb County officer, employee or deputy excluding the following:
(1)
Employer contributions to a plan of deferred compensation that are not included in the employee's gross income for the taxable year in which contributed or employer contributions under a simplified employee pension plan to the extent such contributions are deductible by the employee, or any distributions from a plan of deferred compensation;
(2)
Other amounts which receive special tax benefits; and
(3)
Amounts that do not satisfy the timing rules set forth in the regulations under IRC Section 415.
Compensation for any limitation year is the compensation actually paid or includable in gross income during such year.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in IRC Section 402(g)(3)) and any amount that is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the employee and which is not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of IRC Section 125 or 457. In addition, compensation shall be increased by the amount by which the participant's compensation is reduced by salary reduction or similar arrangement under Section 132(f)(4) (i.e., a qualified transportation fringe benefit program).
The annual compensation taken into account shall not exceed the limitations of IRC Section 401(a)(17) in effect as of the beginning of the plan year in which it is paid.
(d)
Amounts that would otherwise constitute "compensation" above but are paid from a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan sponsored by the employer nevertheless shall constitute "compensation" for purposes of the limitations in IRC Section 415 in the year in which such amounts are actually received by the participant, but only to the extent such amounts are includible in the participant's gross income.
(e)
The following amounts also shall constitute "compensation" under [subsection] (c) above if (i) the amounts are paid by the later of two and one-half (2½) months after the participant's severance from employment with the employer or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the participant's severance from employment, and (ii) the amounts would have constituted compensation under [subsection] (c) above if they were paid prior to the participant's severance from employment with the employer:
(1)
Payment for unused accrued bona fide annual leave or other leave, but only if the participant would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued; and
(2)
Amounts received by a participant pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the payment would have been paid to the participant at the same time if the participant had continued in employment with the employer and only to the extent that the payment is includible in the participant's gross income.
(11)
Minimum distribution requirements.
A.
Benefit payments under this plan must begin by the later of April 1 of the calendar year following the year in which the participant reaches age seventy and one-half (70½) or retires from active employment. The participant's entire interest in the plan must be distributed over the life of the participant or the lives of the participant and a designated beneficiary, over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the participant or the life expectancy of the participant and designated beneficiary.
When a participant dies after distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the participant's interest shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution prior to the participant's death.
When a participant dies before distribution of benefits has begun, the entire interest of the participant shall be distributed within five (5) years of the participant's death. The five-year payment rule does not apply to any portion of the participant's interest which is payable to a designated beneficiary over a period not greater than the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary and which begins within one (1) year after the date of the participant's death. The five-year payment rule does not apply to any portion of the participant's interest which is payable to a surviving spouse over the life or life expectancy of the spouse which begins no later than the date the participant would have reached age seventy and one-half (70½).
B.
[Rules for determination.] The rules set forth in this subsection B shall apply for purposes of determining the required minimum distribution to participants and designated beneficiaries (as defined below) for calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 2003, even if, in the case of a designated beneficiary, the participant died before 2003.
(a)
No extension of death benefits or payment forms. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan. This subsection shall, instead, be deemed to limit and modify any provision of this plan to the extent that such limitation or modification is necessary to ensure that the plan complies with a good faith interpretation of IRC Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Form of distribution. For a participant who is employed by DeKalb County after age seventy and one-half (70½), any distribution payable under this subsection may be paid in any optional form of benefit that is available under the plan, provided that all consent requirements under the plan are satisfied. Any form of distribution payable under this plan, however, must satisfy the following requirements:
(i)
The distribution must be in the form of a periodic annuity for the participant's life, or for the joint life expectancy of the participant and designated beneficiary or over a period certain that does not exceed the maximum length of the period certain determined under the Treasury Regulations.
(ii)
The interval between payments must be uniform over the entire distribution period and must not exceed one (1) year.
(iii)
If payments have commenced over a period certain, the period certain may not be changed.
(iv)
Distributions in the form of a life annuity must satisfy the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) requirement of IRC Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6, A-2, or any successor regulation thereto.
(v)
All payments, either in the form of a life annuity or over a period certain must either be nonincreasing or increase only in accordance with the rules set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6, A-1.
For purposes of this subsection, references to a life annuity shall include an annuity for the joint life expectancy of the participant and the designated beneficiary.
(c)
Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required minimum distribution date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin) is the payment that is required for one (1) payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required minimum distribution date.
(d)
Lump sum distributions. In the case of a lump sum distribution from this plan that is distributed in or after the calendar year in which the participant attains or would have attained age seventy and one-half (70½), the amount of the lump sum that equals the participant's or designated beneficiary's required minimum distribution and is not an eligible rollover distribution, shall be determined using either of the methods set forth in the regulations. The pension board shall have the sole discretion to elect the calculation method but shall apply the same method to all lump sum distributions made in the same calendar year.
(e)
Incidental death benefit requirement. Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant or designated beneficiary must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of IRC Section 401(a)(9)(G). This rule insures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required minimum distribution date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury Regulations.
(f)
Actuarial increase after age seventy and one-half (70½).
(1)
A participant's accrued benefit shall be actuarially increased to take into account the period after age seventy and one-half (70½) in which the employee does not receive any benefits under the plan. The actuarial increase shall commence on April 1 following the calendar year in which the employee attains age seventy and one-half (70½), and end on the date on which benefits commence after retirement in an amount sufficient to satisfy IRC Section 401(a)(9).
The accrued benefit payable to such a participant as of the end of the period for which the actuarial increase is required shall not be less than:
(i)
The actuarial equivalent of the employee's accrued benefit as of April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the participant attained age seventy and one-half (70½); plus
(ii)
The actuarial equivalent of any additional benefits accrued after the date described in [subsection] (i) above; less
(iii)
The actuarial equivalent of any distributions made with respect to the participant's accrued benefit after such date.
(2)
The actuarial increase described above may reduce the benefit accrual otherwise required under IRC Section 41 l(b)(1)(H)(i).
(3)
The actuarial adjustment described above shall be made even during a period for which benefits are suspended.
(g)
Board discretion. The pension board shall have discretion to apply the provisions of this subsection to any benefit option elected by the participant to the extent necessary to avoid violating IRC Section 401(a)(9). The pension board may, for example, modify a participant's selection of an optional form of benefit to satisfy the incidental death benefit requirement by requiring that the participant select another form of benefit or another contingent annuitant, or by modifying the form of benefit so it complies with the applicable rules.
(h)
Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this subsection, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary.
(i)
Designated beneficiary. The term "designated beneficiary" shall be determined in accordance with the definition of "beneficiary" in the regulations, notwithstanding that this definition may be different from that set forth elsewhere in this plan, provided that any individual who is a designated beneficiary must also be a beneficiary (but not necessarily all of the beneficiaries) as defined in this plan. Each beneficiary, as defined in the plan, however, need not be a designated beneficiary in the event, for example, that a beneficiary disclaims his interest under this plan.
(ii)
Spouse. "Spouse" shall mean "spouse" as defined in the regulations. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed, however, to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan.
(iii)
Regulations. "Regulations" shall refer to the Treasury Regulations (including temporary regulations) promulgated under IRC Section 401(a)(9), as set forth in Treasury Regulations 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-6T, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS in the form of revenue rulings, notices, other regulations and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or any successor thereto.
(iv)
Distribution calendar year. "Distribution calendar year" is a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year that contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin.
(v)
Life expectancy. "Life expectancy" shall mean the period computed by the use of the Single Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the regulations.
(12)
Direct rollover of eligible rollover distributions. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary, that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
(a)
Definitions.
(1)
Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income.
(2)
Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in IRC Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in IRC Section 408(b), an annuity plan described in IRC Section 403(a), a qualified trust described in IRC Section 401(a), an annuity contract described in IRC Section 403(b), and an eligible plan under IRC Section 457(b) that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state that agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, provided that such account, annuity, contract, plan or trust accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. Effective January 1, 2008, eligible retirement plan shall include a Roth IRA established under IRC Section 408A.
(3)
Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO), as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. For distributions on and after January 1, 2007, a "distributee" includes a non-spouse beneficiary if the eligible rollover distribution is made to an individual retirement plan that is treated as an inherited individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity in accordance with IRC Section 402(c)(11).
(4)
Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.
(b)
Special rules for rollovers of after-tax contributions. To the extent that an eligible rollover distribution includes amounts that are not includible in gross income, such an amount shall constitute an eligible rollover distribution to the extent that (i) it is transferred in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a qualified trust or to an annuity contract described in IRC Section 403(b), and such trust or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution that is not so includible, or (ii) such portion is transferred to an individual retirement account described in IRC Section 408(a) or an individual retirement annuity described in IRC Section 408(b) (other than an endowment contract).
Effective January 1, 1988, the pension board will consider an adjustment to retirement benefits not less than on an annual basis, and will make a formal determination as to whether such adjustment should be granted. Consideration of any such adjustment will be made only in conjunction with information furnished in an annual actuarial report as provided in section 11 of this act [§ 911 of this appendix]. Nothing contained herein is to be construed as making any benefit adjustment automatic or mandatory in nature. In making such determination, the pension board will take into account the information contained in the annual actuarial report and any other policy issues regarding total retirement benefits or the pension plan in general. No adjustment will be made which would adversely affect the financial soundness of the plan without first making provision for any additional contributions necessary to retain financial soundness.
Forfeiture of contributions and benefits. Subject to the requirement for the giving of notice as set forth herein, a terminated participant's contributions plus interest shall be forfeited to the pension fund on the date (the "forfeiture date") which is seven (7) years after the last to occur of the following: (i) date of termination of the participant's employment with the county, (ii) date of issuance of a subsequently uncashed or undeliverable and unclaimed check refunding such contributions and interest, (iii) as to a participant with three (3) years or more of service, the first date as of which the participant is or becomes eligible for a retirement benefit under this plan, or (iv) the participant's expressed date of intent to retire which is in accordance with the provisions of this Act and is on file with the clerk of the pension board as of the time the determination with regard to forfeiture is made; provided, however, that a participant's contributions plus interest shall not be deemed abandoned if, within the applicable seven-year period, the participant has accepted a distribution from the pension fund, corresponded in writing concerning such contributions or interest, or otherwise indicated an interest as evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file with the clerk of the pension board; and provided, further that contributions and interest of a participant shall not be deemed forfeited unless the pension board sends written notice to the participant, not less than thirty (30) days following any forfeiture date, advising the participant of the applicable provisions of this section, and the participant fails, within thirty (30) days following the giving of such notice, to correspond in writing to the board concerning such contributions or interest, or otherwise expresses to the board an interest therein. Such notice from the board shall be sent by first class mail to the last known address of the participant as shown on the records of the board, but need not be sent if the address of the participant is shown by the board's records to be inaccurate or if the amount of contributions and interest involved is less than fifty dollars ($50.00). Any eligible participant or beneficiary who applies for a pension benefit later than the first date of eligibility shall forfeit to the pension fund all monthly benefits to which he or she would have been entitled prior to the first day of the month following the actual date of application for a pension. Any participant whose contributions are actually abandoned and paid over to the State of Georgia or another state in accordance with any provision of law shall be ineligible to thereafter receive pension benefits under the plan. Terminated employees who forfeit contributions and interest shall retain eligibility for the same monthly pension benefits for which they were eligible prior to the forfeiture, if any, but they shall be ineligible to withdraw contributions or interest.

Retirement incentives.
(1)
1996 retirement incentive. A participant who has attained age fifty (50) and less than age fifty-five (55), and who has completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service, and who retires with an early retirement date between September 1, 1996 and November 1, 1996 (inclusive) shall receive an immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall be an amount computed and payable in accordance with subsection 3.B. of this section 8, with no deduction for each complete month by which the date the benefit commences precedes the normal retirement date of the participant.
(2)
2010 retirement incentives.
A.
2010 early-out incentive. A participant shall receive the retirement opportunity and incentive referred to herein as the "2010 early-out incentive" only if the participant: is a current DeKalb County officer, employee, or deputy as of May 30, 2010; completes at least twenty-five (25) years of credited service as of May 31, 2010; is less than fifty (50) years of age on May 31, 2010; submits to the director of finance a fully completed and executed 2010 retirement incentive application and waiver/release between March 2 and April 16, 2010; allows that waiver/release to become effective and enforceable; and elects to retire with a retirement date of May 31, 2010. A participant who satisfies all these criteria and requirements for the 2010 early-out incentive shall receive an immediate monthly retirement benefit in an amount that is computed and payable in the same manner as a normal retirement benefit in accordance with subsection (b)1.B. of this section 8 [908], with no deduction for each complete month by which the date the benefit commences precedes the participant's normal retirement date. A participant who satisfies all criteria and requirements for the 2010 early-out incentive shall also receive, after his retirement date, a lump sum retirement benefit from the pension fund in an amount equal to the net value of the participant's unused accumulated annual leave (up to sixty (60) days) at his regular rate of pay. Because a participant who satisfies all criteria and requirements for the 2010 early-out incentive shall receive, from the pension fund, the retirement benefit described in the previous sentence, such a participant shall not be eligible to receive payment from any other source for any amount of unused accumulated annual leave. Some participants who are eligible to receive the 2010 early-out incentive may be deemed "key employees" because their retirement on May 31, 2010, would cause a substantial business hardship for the county. The chief executive officer or another elected county officer may defer the retirement date of a key employee under his supervision for up to three (3) months after May 31, 2010, if that key employee agrees in writing, before May 31, 2010, to accept the deferred retirement date. A key employee who agrees to accept a deferred retirement date shall not be paid any retirement benefit under this paragraph until after his deferred retirement date.
B.
2010 retirement-plus incentive. A participant shall receive the retirement opportunity and incentive package referred to herein as the "2010 retirement-plus incentive" only if the participant: is a current DeKalb County officer, employee, or deputy as of May 30, 2010; completes at least eight (8) years of credited service as of May 31, 2010; reaches the age of fifty (50) years on or before May 31, 2010; submits to the director of finance a fully completed and executed 2010 retirement incentive application and waiver/release between March 2 and April 16, 2010; allows that waiver/release to become effective and enforceable; and elects to retire with a retirement date of May 31, 2010. A participant who satisfies all these criteria and requirements for the 2010 retirement-plus incentive shall receive an immediate monthly retirement benefit in an amount that is computed and payable in the same manner as a normal retirement benefit in accordance with subsection (b)1.B. of this section 8 [908], with no deduction for each complete month by which the date the benefit commences precedes the participant's normal retirement date, and with two (2) years of service added to the participant's credited years of service for the purpose of calculating the participant's benefit under subsection (b)1.B. of this section 8 [908], except that the two (2) added years of service shall not increase the participant's credited years of service to a total higher than thirty (30) years. A participant who satisfies all criteria and requirements for the 2010 retirement-plus incentive may, in his timely-submitted 2010 retirement incentive application, elect to receive zero (0) percent, ten (10) percent, or twenty-five (25) percent of the actuarial present value of the total retirement benefit described above in this paragraph as a lump sum payment in 2010; however, if such a participant receives ten (10) percent or twenty-five (25) percent of the actuarial present value of that retirement benefit as a lump sum payment in 2010, then the participant's monthly retirement benefit amount shall be reduced based on the ten (10) percent or twenty-five (25) percent reduction in the actuarial present value of the amount remaining to be paid out to the participant. A participant who satisfies all criteria and requirements for the 2010 retirement-plus incentive shall also receive, after his retirement date, a lump sum retirement benefit from the pension fund in an amount equal to the net value of the participant's unused accumulated annual leave (up to sixty (60) days) at his regular rate of pay, plus one of the following two (2) amounts, whichever is larger: the net value of twenty-five (25) days of annual leave at the participant's regular rate of pay, or fifty (50) percent of the net value of the participant's unused accumulated annual leave (up to sixty (60) days) at his regular rate of pay. Because a participant who satisfies all criteria and requirements for the 2010 retirement-plus incentive shall receive, from the pension fund, the retirement benefit described in the previous sentence, such a participant shall not be eligible to receive payment from any other source for any amount of unused accumulated annual leave. Some participants who are eligible to receive the 2010 retirement-plus incentive may be deemed "key employees" because their retirement on May 31, 2010, would cause a substantial business hardship for the county. The chief executive officer or another elected county officer may defer the retirement date of a key employee under his supervision for up to three (3) months after May 31, 2010, if that key employee agrees in writing, before May 31, 2010, to accept the deferred retirement date. A key employee who agrees to accept a deferred retirement date shall not be paid any retirement benefit under this paragraph until after his deferred retirement date.
C.
Funding.

  Sec. 911. - Same—Appropriation; employment of actuary.
Commencing January 1, 1996, the governing authority in charge of county affairs for DeKalb County shall appropriate to the pension fund annually, to be paid in monthly installments, an amount equal to three and one-quarter (3.25) percentum of the amount of monthly compensation of each participant in this pension system. After forty (40) years of accreditable service under pension service no further contributions to the pension plan shall be made by DeKalb County on behalf of the employee.
Within sixty (60) days prior to the end of the first one-year period next following the effective date of this act [article], it shall be the duty of the governing authority of DeKalb County to employ some qualified actuary or firm of actuaries to analyze the DeKalb County pension plan and report thereon to the pension board. Should such report reveal that the contribution plan herein provided to be made by DeKalb County be insufficient to maintain the plan on a sound basis, it shall be the duty of such governing authority of DeKalb County to appropriate such further sums for the next one (1) year as would be necessary to maintain the fund and the plan on a sound financial basis. Should the actuary or firm of actuaries find that a lesser contribution to DeKalb County would maintain the fund and plan on a sound financial basis, DeKalb County is authorized to decrease its contribution to the percentage of the total payroll of the participants found by the actuary or firm of actuaries to be sufficient to maintain the plan and the fund on such sound financial basis. The pension plan shall be actuarially reviewed each one (1) year thereafter and adjustments made as set out herein if such adjustments are found to be necessary, and the actuary or firm of actuaries employed to make such analyses shall be selected by the pension board.

Any officer, employee or deputy who chose not to participate in this pension plan at its inception on July 12, 1962, may become a participant by:
(1)
Authorizing deductions to be made from his earnings on the basis set out herein for participants with his "years of service" to begin on the first day of the month immediately following this authorization, and his participation subject to all the provisions of this plan.

  Sec. 913. - Disability pension—Definition; filing of physicians' certificates; hearing.
Effective January 1, 1981, a participant shall be totally disabled for purposes of determining his eligibility retirement under section 8 [§ 908 of this appendix] and other matters related to this pension plan if the participant is in a continuous state of incapacity due to illness or injury which:
(a)
While it continues during the first twelve (12) months of incapacity prevents the participant from performing the duties of his normal occupation with the county; and
(b)
While it continues thereafter, prevents the participant from engaging in any occupation for which he is or becomes reasonably qualified by education, training or experience.
Whenever an application for disability pension has been filed, the applicant shall submit therewith a signed certificate from a licensed, practicing physician of Georgia certifying to the total disability of such applicant for a pension. Immediately thereupon the pension board shall order the applicant to be examined by the county physician or some other physician named by the board who likewise shall certify the physical ability or total disability of the applicant. In the event the certificates of the respective physicians shall generally agree upon total disability, such facts shall be conclusive as to the physical or mental condition of the applicant and the board shall thereupon enter an order granting a pension in the proper amount. In the event the certificate tendered by the applicant and the certification of the county physician appointed by the board shall disagree as to the condition of the applicant, the pension board shall consider both opinions and render a decision. If the pension board denies the application, the participant may request a hearing before the pension board. Such hearing shall be conducted informally by the examination of witnesses for and in opposition to such application who shall be sworn, and both the applicant and pension board may be represented by legal counsel if they so desire. Copies of documents may be received as evidence in lieu of the original at the discretion of the board, and affidavits shall be filed with the board at the time of the hearing. The decision of the board after a hearing shall be final as to the physical or mental condition of the applicant, but the proceeding shall be subject to review by writ of certiorari from the superior court of DeKalb County. The chairman of the pension board shall be authorized to acknowledge service on any such writ, and to answer same on behalf of the pension board.

  Sec. 914. - Same—Annual review.
The pension board shall have the right, at intervals of not less than one (1) year, to require an examination of all participants receiving disability pensions under the provisions of this act [article]. In the event any such participant receiving disability pension shall be found, as a result of such examination, not to be disabled, the pension board may, after hearing evidence thereon, and an opportunity to such participant to be heard, remove such participant from the list of those entitled to disability pension. Provided, however, that in the event such participant receiving disability benefits refuses to submit to a physical examination after thirty (30) days' notice to report for such examination, the pension board shall withhold payments of his benefits until he submits to such examination and the participant shall be deemed to have forfeited his benefits during the time of his refusal to submit to a physical examination.

Sec. 915.1. - Credit for prior service.
Any participant in the plan herein who shall return to the service of DeKalb County after an absence therefrom, whether under resignation, leave of absence or discharge, shall be entitled to credit against his service for all periods of time he has served as an officer or employee, or as a deputy of an officer of DeKalb County, provided such participant makes formal application to repurchase prior service credit (on such form as provided by DeKalb County) within six (6) months of the date of return to service, and provided that such participant shall restore to the pension fund, within twenty-four (24) months after official written notice of approval by the human resources and merit system director of the participant's application to repurchase prior service credit, all sums which he may have withdrawn from the pension fund on the date of his resignation or discharge from county service, together with interest thereon at the rate of eight (8) percent per annum from the date of his resignation or discharge from county service. Said sum may be paid in equal installments over a period not to exceed twenty-four (24) months; provided, however, should a participant under this section become eligible for any benefits before this amount is fully paid, the amount due the pension fund by him shall be deducted from such benefits at a rate to be determined by the board. Any participant who is granted an official leave of absence by the county for a period not to exceed six (6) months at any one (1) time and who does not withdraw his contributions from the pension fund may receive service credit for the duration of such leave of absence by paying into the pension fund the contributions he would have had had he been in continuous employment based on his salary or wages as of the last day of active duty. This amount may be repaid within twelve (12) months of the date of his return to duty and the county shall pay into the pension fund the same contribution required of it as if such employee had continued on active duty; provided, however, that should a participant under this section become eligible for benefits before this amount is fully paid, the amount due the pension fund shall be deducted from such benefits at a rate to be determined by the board.
Any participant who becomes a participant in this plan, leaves the service of DeKalb County, and then, on or after September 1, 2005, returns to the service of DeKalb County under this plan following an absence, shall resume participation in this plan as part of the same group of participants (group 1, 2, or 3, as defined in section 908 above) that he was part of immediately before such absence, provided that he did not receive a return of contributions. If any such participant received a return of contributions, he shall resume participation in this plan as a group 2 participant upon return to DeKalb County service between August 31, 2005 and January 1, 2016, and shall resume participation in the plan as a group 3 participant upon return to DeKalb County service on or after January 1, 2016, whether or not he restores the amounts that he withdrew with interest.

Sec. 918. - Credit for military service.
Any participant who shall have served in the armed forces of the United States during World War I or World War II or the Korean War and who, at the time of induction into said armed forces, was an officer, employee or deputy of DeKalb County, shall be entitled to have credit against his service with said county all of the time represented by the period of said service. Any participant who shall hereafter be inducted into the armed forces of the United States by conscription or under any compulsory military plan, shall likewise be entitled to credit for service during the period he was absent from county service and in the armed forces of the United States; provided such employee shall, within six (6) months after his discharge from the armed service, return to the service of DeKalb County, and pay to the pension fund a sum equal to the amount of the contribution which said participant would have made to the pension fund had he continued in the county service and had not been inducted into the armed forces of the United States, such payment to be made in not more than twelve (12) equal monthly installments. Should a participant under this section become eligible for benefits before this amount is fully paid in, the amount due the pension fund shall be deducted from such benefits at a rate to be determined by the board. Military service shall not be construed to interrupt continuous service.
(a)
The plan will grant continuous service for a period of military service in accordance with the requirements of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), O.C.G.A. § 38-2-279(f), and any other related federal or state laws, to a participant who was a current DeKalb County officer, employee or deputy when such military service commenced and who satisfies all terms and conditions to obtain such continuous service under one (1) or more of those laws, and will grant the participant an accrued benefit for such a period of military service if and to the extent that the participant or his beneficiary or estate makes up any required participant contributions as provided below. Such a participant, or the beneficiary or estate of a deceased participant, shall have the right to make up the participant's missed contributions and thereby receive an accrued benefit for a period equal to the participant's period of military service, up to the maximum number of years permitted under applicable laws. The participant, beneficiary or estate must notify the pension board of the desire to repay the missed participant contributions.
(b)
A participant seeking to exercise a legal right to make up required participant contributions to obtain an accrued benefit for a period of military service shall make such contributions either in one (1) lump sum payment or in installments paid during a period that ends no longer than five (5) years after the period of military service ends. If the participant died during the period of military service, a beneficiary or legal representative of the participant's estate seeking to exercise a legal right to make up required participant contributions to obtain an accrued benefit for the participant's period of military service shall make such contributions no later than one (1) year following proof of the participant's death. Make-up contributions for participants who are reemployed by the county after military service may be deducted from the participant's salary or other compensation on a pre-tax basis.
(c)
The amount of participant contributions required to obtain an accrued benefit for a period of military service shall be the amount of contributions that the participant would have been required to make during that period of military service if he had been continuously employed with the county during that period, calculated using the participant contribution rate(s) that were applicable during that period and the pay rate(s) the employee would have received during that period. If the determination of said pay rate(s) is not reasonably certain, the pay rate used to calculate the amount of participant contributions to be paid shall be the participant's average rate of compensation during the twelve-month period (or period of county employment, if shorter) immediately preceding his military service.
(d)
To the extent required or permitted by applicable law, a participant shall be required to inform the county in writing before entering military service in order to be eligible for continuing service as described above.

  Sec. 933. - Effect of working for DeKalb County after retirement under this plan.
(a)
Limits on county employment while receiving benefits under this plan. No participant shall receive any benefits from this plan while receiving salary or wages as an officer, employee or deputy of DeKalb County, except that after August 31, 2010, a participant may, after retirement under this plan, work as a merit-exempt, part-time officer, employee or deputy of the county without any discontinuation of the participant's benefits under this plan, subject to the following limitations:
(1)
Limit on hours of postretirement employment in a calendar year.
(A)
If a participant exceeds one thousand forty (1,040) hours of postretirement county employment in calendar year 2010, 2011, or 2012, the participant's benefits under this plan shall be discontinued for the remainder of each such calendar year in which the participant exceeds the one-thousand-forty-hour-limit, beginning with the month after the participant exceeds that limit.
(B)
If a participant exceeds four hundred sixteen (416) hours of postretirement county employment in any calendar year after 2012, the participant's benefits under this plan shall be discontinued for the remainder of that calendar year, beginning with the month after the participant exceeds the four-hundred-sixteen-hour limit.
(2)
Limit on postretirement county salary and/or wages in a calendar year.
(A)
If a participant earns postretirement county salary and/or wages in calendar year 2010, 2011 or 2012 that exceed fifty (50) percent of the participant's last preretirement annual base salary from the county, the participant's benefits under this plan shall be discontinued for the remainder of each such calendar year in which the participant's county salary and/or wages exceed that limit, beginning with the month after the participant's postretirement county salary and/or wages exceed that limit.
(B)
If a participant earns postretirement county salary and/or wages in any calendar year after 2012 that exceed twenty (20) percent of the participant's last preretirement annual base salary from the county, the participant's benefits under this plan shall be discontinued for the remainder of that calendar year, beginning with the month after the participant's postretirement county salary and/or wages exceed that limit.
(3)
If a participant works as a part-time county officer, employee, or deputy while receiving benefits under this plan in any three (3) calendar years, whether consecutive or not, the participant shall not receive any benefits under this plan while working as a county officer, employee or deputy in any fourth or later calendar year(s).
(4)
If a participant receives health insurance, life insurance, paid sick leave and/or paid annual leave that is paid for or subsidized by DeKalb County because of any postretirement employment, the participant's benefits under this plan shall be discontinued during the period in which the participant receives such insurance and/or leave.
(5)
In any calendar year (after 2011) that begins after a participant has reached the age of sixty-two (62) years, the restrictions in subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section 933(a) shall not apply to that participant. However, if a participant over age sixty-two (62) at the beginning of a calendar year (after 2011) earns postretirement county salary and/or wages in that calendar year that exceed the larger of the two (2) amounts described in [subsections] (A) and (B) below, the participant's benefits under this plan shall be discontinued for the remainder of that calendar year, beginning with the month after the participant's postretirement county salary and/or wages for the calendar year exceed the larger of the following two (2) amounts:
(A)
The amount equal to the county salary and/or wages the participant earned during the participant's last full calendar year of preretirement county employment (excluding any payout for unused annual leave) minus twelve (12) months of the participant's monthly retirement benefit as calculated under this plan for the current calendar year; or
(B)
The amount that equals fifty (50) percent of the participant's last preretirement annual base salary from the county.
Pension contributions shall be deducted from a participant's salary or wages during any period(s) of postretirement employment as a DeKalb County officer, employee or deputy when the participant's benefits under this plan are discontinued for any reason. For purposes of this section 933, "preretirement" refers to the period before a participant first received a pension benefit under subsection 8(b)(1), 8(b)(2), or 8(b)(3) of this plan [subsection 908(b)(1), 908(b)(2), or 908(b)(3) of this appendix] or under the 1996 or 2010 retirement incentives [subsection 908.1(b) of this appendix].
(b)
Limits on independent contractor service to or for DeKalb County while receiving benefits under this plan.

(c)
Prohibition of combined employee and independent contractor work while receiving benefits under this plan.

A participant who, after retirement under this plan, returns to work as a DeKalb County officer, employee, or deputy or performs services for DeKalb County or its officers or elected officials as an independent contractor shall be required to give the pension administrator notice of the expected return to work seven (7) days prior to the date the employment or services begin and shall be required to provide the pension administrator with any information requested regarding the expected term, hours, compensation and/or benefits associated with such employment or independent contractor status.
(e)
Monthly retirement benefit upon later retirement not reduced because of return to work. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, returning to work as a DeKalb County officer, employee, or deputy after retirement under this plan shall not cause a participant to receive, upon any later retirement under this plan, a monthly retirement benefit that is less than the actuarial equivalent of the monthly retirement benefit the participant was entitled to receive at the time of his earlier retirement under this plan, using the actuarial factors in effect on the date of the later retirement.

(1)
No pension board member shall directly or indirectly request, exact, receive or agree to receive a gift, loan, favor, promise or thing of value: (1) from any party with whom the pension board transacts business; or (2) from any other party if that party tends to influence the board member in the discharge of official duties or the board member recently has been, or is now or in the near future will be, involved in any official act or action directly affecting the donor or lender. This section shall not apply in the case of (1) a commercially reasonable loan made in the ordinary course of business by an institution authorized by the laws of the state to engage in the making of such a loan; or (2) an award publicly presented in recognition of public service.
(2)
No pension board member shall disclose or otherwise use confidential information acquired by virtue of his or her position as a member of the pension board for his or another person's private gain.
(3)

(4)
No pension board member shall bring, instigate, or otherwise be party to a legal action against DeKalb County, the pension board, or any other person or entity if the remedy or relief sought in such legal action would or could in any manner adversely affect or impact the pension fund or the pension board's ability to carry out its official duties.
(b)
Any board member who has reason to believe of the existence of any conflict or potential conflict shall promptly disclose such conflict or potential conflict to the pension board.
(c)
If any voting board member believes he or she has a conflict or potential conflict with regard to any matter brought before the pension board, then that member shall abstain from voting on such matter.
(d)
If a board member votes on a matter for which the pension board, by majority vote of all members of the board, determines that such board member has a conflict or potential conflict, then such vote shall not count, but shall instead be treated as if the board member had abstained from voting on such matter.
(e)
The pension board may, by majority vote of all members of the pension board, remove from the pension board any elected board member it concludes has violated the provisions of this section.

(f)
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any pension board member who is a current or former employee of DeKalb County from voting on issues concerning pension benefits for county employees or retirees, or from voting on any other official matter that comes before the pension board, so long as such matter does not solely or exclusively benefit such pension board member.
