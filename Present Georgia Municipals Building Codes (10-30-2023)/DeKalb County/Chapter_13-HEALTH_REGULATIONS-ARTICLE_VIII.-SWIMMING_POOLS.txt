(c)
Size. The minimum pool surface area shall be five hundred (500) square feet, except where otherwise described in this article. Calculations for determining size of a pool and the number and type of associated facilities shall be based on the maximum bathing load. Pool usage shall not exceed the maximum bathing load. The bathing load shall be calculated on the basis of one (1) person for each ten (10) square feet of pool surface area where the depth is less than or equal to five (5) feet; one (1) person for each twenty (20) square feet of pool surface in that portion where the depth exceeds five (5) feet approved diving area; and one (1) person for every three hundred (300) square feet where depths exceed five (5) feet and one (1) or more diving boards/platforms are installed. The department shall determine the bathing load for any pool that is designated as a "Special Purpose" pool, any pool with use restrictions, or pools serving facilities with no dwelling units. Pool bathing load shall be determined by the department based on the anticipated usage and assessment of other, similar facilities.
(d)
Depths. Minimum water depths shall be determined by the intended use of the pool. Depth at the slope-break shall not be greater than five (5) feet for pools with depths exceeding five (5) feet. In the diving well, depth shall be as stipulated in the ANSI Standard for Public Swimming Pools Section entitled "Diving" and in accordance with the minimum specifications as indicated in the (see Appendix — Figure No. 2) "Minimum Water Envelopes" from the same standard.

If water for the device is not taken directly from the pool, then the water for the device shall be circulated through a separate system consisting of pump(s), filter(s), disinfection equipment, and other appurtenances, as required by the department and this article. This includes, but is not limited to, spray guns, "mushrooms," buckets, water wheels, and other similar devices. Any water being discharged into pool water, or that makes contact with users or bathers, shall have the same minimum level of disinfection that is required for the type of pool that the device is installed within, as required in the section [13-197], "Disinfection and chemical feeders."
