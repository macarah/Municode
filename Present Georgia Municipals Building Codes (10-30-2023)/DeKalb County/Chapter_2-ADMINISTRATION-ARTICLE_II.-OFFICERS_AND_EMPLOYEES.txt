(5)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the chief executive fails to nominate individuals to fill any of the aforementioned positions within the ninety-day period specified, any member of the board of commissioners, including the chief executive, may nominate an individual to fill the positions of executive assistant and county attorney, and a majority vote of the board shall be required to confirm the appointment.
(c)
The chief executive may suspend or discharge the executive assistant or county attorney but any individual so suspended or discharged shall have the right of appeal to the full board of commissioners. The individual suspended or discharged shall file a written demand with the clerk of the board of commissioners asking that such appeal be placed on the first available agenda for consideration by the full board and it shall be the duty of the clerk of the board of commissioners to place the individual's appeal before the full board of commissioners on the first available agenda. Upon consideration of the appeal by the full board of commissioners, the full board of commissioners may set aside the suspension or discharge and reinstate the employee.
(d)
In addition, the board of commissioners shall have the right to suspend or discharge for cause, the executive assistant or the county attorney by a majority vote thereof. For these purposes, "cause" shall include deliberately withholding lawful information or causing to be withheld lawful information from the board of commissioners or furnishing or causing to be furnished falsified information to the board of commissioners.
(e)
All employees of the county who are subject to the jurisdiction of the governing authority of the county and who are not covered by the county merit system regulations, and where no contrary provisions or regulations have been or may hereafter be enacted by the board of commissioners, shall be employed, promoted, transferred, demoted and discharged by the chief executive and their salaries established and fixed by the chief executive within the budgetary limits set by the board of commissioners.

Sec. 2-62. - Declaration of policy.
It is essential to the proper government and administration of the county that its chief executive, board of commissioners, appointive officials, duly appointed members of the county planning commission and the county board of appeals be, and give the appearance of being, independent and impartial; that public service not be used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the county. Because the attainment of one (1) or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact or appears to exist a conflict between the private interests and public responsibilities of county officials, the public interest requires that the county protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the officials named above in situations where a conflict may exist. It is also essential to the efficient operation of the county that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust. Accordingly, the standards hereinafter set forth must be so interpreted and understood as not to unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire or inclination to seek and serve in public office by those persons best qualified to serve. To that end, the officials hereinabove named should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunity available to all other citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests except where a conflict of interest situation would necessarily result. The policy and purpose of this division, therefore, is to make clear those standards of ethical conduct that shall be applicable to the officials named above in the discharge of their official duties; to implement the objective of protecting the integrity of the county's government and to prescribe only such essential restrictions against conflict of interest as will not impose unnecessary barriers against public service.

Upon receipt of a complaint, the presiding officer shall cause a committee to be formed consisting of the presiding officer, the chief executive and one (1) member of the board of commissioners to be appointed by the official or appointive official alleged to have violated this division. If the presiding officer or the chief executive is the subject of a complaint or is otherwise unable to serve, the deputy presiding officer shall serve on the committee instead. The committee thus formed shall make such investigation of the complaint as it deems appropriate with respect to the matters contained in the complaint and, within thirty (30) days of its appointment, shall report its findings to the full board of commissioners. If the committee finds that a violation has occurred, it shall also recommend whether the board of commissioners shall either censure or reprimand the official or appointive official or take no further action. The board of commissioners at its next regular meeting, not less than fifteen (15) days after the committee makes its report, shall, by an affirmative vote of not less than four (4) members, act upon the report by either censuring or reprimanding the official or appointive official or, in its discretion, taking no further action.

(4)
The provisions of a defense against the claim or proceeding would not be in the best interest of the county;

(6)
The employee acts or fails to act, except in emergencies or the existence of extenuating circumstances, directly contrary to advice of the county attorney or safety personnel;
(7)
