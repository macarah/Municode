(f)

ARTICLE VI. - ENTERPRISE ZONE PROGRAM

Sec. 24-101. - Purpose and scope.
(a)
The DeKalb County Board of Commissioners has found that there is a need for revitalization in certain areas of DeKalb County. Revitalization will improve geographic areas within DeKalb County that are suffering from disinvestments, underdevelopment, and economic decline and will encourage private businesses to reinvest and rehabilitate such areas. This article should be liberally construed to accomplish these purposes.
(b)
The eligibility requirements contained herein are the minimum necessary to consider granting an application to participate in the enterprise zone program. The fact that an area or business may meet such eligibility requirements shall not entitle any such area, business or applicant to an enterprise zone designation or to additional incentives.
(Ord. No. 13-02, Pt. I, 12-20-01; Ord. No. 06-15, Pt. I, 9-12-06)
Sec. 24-102. - Criteria and boundaries of area-wide enterprise zones.
(a)
In order to be designated as an enterprise zone, a nominated area shall meet at least three (3) of the five (5) criteria specified in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this Code section 24-102. Creation of an enterprise zone shall be consistent with the DeKalb County Comprehensive Plan, as amended. The criteria for designation of an enterprise zone as set forth herein tracks the criteria set forth in O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6 and, in the event of conflict with state law, state law shall control.
(b)
Pervasive poverty shall be evidenced by showing that poverty is widespread throughout the nominated area and shall be established by using the following criteria:
(1)
The poverty rate shall be determined from the data in the most current United States decennial census prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Census;
(2)
For each census geographic block group within the nominated area, the ratio of income to poverty level for at least twenty (20) percent of the residents shall be less than one (1.0);
(3)
Census geographic block groups with no population shall be treated as having a poverty rate which meets the standards of paragraph (2) of this subsection; and
(4)
All parcels of a nominated area must abut and may not contain a noncontiguous parcel, unless non-abutting parcel qualifies separately under the criteria set forth under paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(c)
Unemployment shall be evidenced by the use of data published by the Office of Labor Information Systems of the Georgia Department of Labor indicating that the average rate of unemployment for the nominated area for the preceding calendar year is at least ten (10) percent higher than the state average rate of unemployment or by evidence of adverse economic conditions brought about by significant job dislocation within the nominated area such as the closing of a manufacturing plant or federal facility.
(d)
General distress shall be evidenced by adverse conditions within the nominated area other than those of pervasive poverty and unemployment. Examples of such adverse conditions include, but are not limited to, a high incidence of crime, abandoned or dilapidated structures, deteriorated infrastructure, and substantial population decline, relative to other comparable areas of the state.
(e)
Underdevelopment shall be evidenced by data indicating that recent development activities, or lack thereof, in the nominated area is lower than other development activity within DeKalb County. Such evidence may include data on land disturbance permits, business license fees, building permits, development fees, or other similar data indicating that the level of development in the nominated area is lower than development activity in other parts of DeKalb County. The data used shall be comparable in point or period of time and methodology employed.
(f)
General blight within the nominated area shall be evidenced by the inclusion of any portion of the nominated area in an urban redevelopment area as defined by O.C.G.A. § 36-61-2(20) for which an urban redevelopment plan has been adopted by the affected governing bodies according to the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 36-61-1.
(g)
The DeKalb County Board of Commissioners finds that based on the evidence, the area contained in the enterprise zone delineated in subparagraph (h) of this section satisfies at least three (3) of the five (5) criteria set forth in subsections (b) through (f) above and in O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6 and constitutes the enterprise zone(s) of DeKalb County. There is evidence of adverse economic conditions brought about by levels of poverty of at least twenty (20) percent, unemployment of ten (10) percent or more than the state average rate of unemployment as reported by the Office of Labor Information Systems of the Georgia Department of Labor, evidence of general distress within the enterprise zones of DeKalb County other than poverty and unemployment, including population loss, tax delinquency or high incidence of crime, evidence of underdevelopment lower than development activity within DeKalb County as a whole, and/or evidence of general blight.
