Crosswalks for median-divided streets shall provide for barrier-free passage and refuge areas as illustrated in Exhibit 3. Crosswalks shall be accompanied by pedestrian signals where required by DeKalb County and in conformity with the Manual for Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
J.
On-street parking. On-street parking is an efficient manner to provide convenient store-front parking and residential parking on minor streets in order to reduce the need for large surface parking lots. See Exhibits 1 and 2. An on-street parking space along the street frontage of an adjacent parcel shall not be counted with off-street and shared parking to meet parking requirements of chapter 27 when such parking space is within seven hundred (700) feet of a building entrance for which the parking space is required. On-street parking spaces shall be safely accessed from the travel lanes of the adjoining street, paved to the specifications of public streets and demarcated with painted lines not less than three (3) inches in width. Parallel parking spaces shall be not less than nine (9) feet wide and not less than twenty (20) feet in length. DeKalb County shall have sole authority to determine time limits, metering, and signage of on-street parking spaces on public streets within the overlay district.
K.
Off-street parking lots. Off-street parking lots shall be provided where there is not enough on-street parking available to satisfy the minimum parking requirements of chapter 27 and the Northlake Commercial Center Overlay District. Where possible, off-street parking lots shall be designed with interconnecting driveways and parking areas to encourage shared use with adjacent parcels. Joint access driveways and continuous access drives behind or between multiple parcels is encouraged to provide continuous inter-parcel access and lessen the need to re-enter public streets to make short trips. The satisfaction of minimum parking requirements with shared parking shall be subject to approval by the DeKalb County Planning Director based on a shared parking analysis performed to the standards of the Institute for Transportation Engineers.
Off-street parking lots shall be designed to minimize the view of parking from adjacent streets and sidewalks. No more than thirty (30) percent of the required parking spaces for a parcel shall be located in front yards. Off-street parking lots shall be separated from abutting streets by landscape strips and sidewalks as illustrated in Exhibits 1 and 2. Parking lots shall be separated from parking lots on adjacent parcels by landscape strips not less than ten (10) feet in width, planted with shrubbery, trees, and groundcover. Landscape strips may be broken by perpendicular access drives and pedestrian walkways or sidewalks. Plant materials shall be selected from the approved plant list in the appendix unless otherwise approved by the planning director.
Off-street parking lots shall be designed to provide for safe and continuous passage of pedestrians between parking bays and building entrances, and between adjacent parking areas and buildings. Landscape strips at the perimeter of off-street parking lots shall provide for safe and convenient crossings by vehicles and pedestrians as shown in Exhibit 8. Pedestrian pathways in parking lots and pedestrian ways that cross vehicular aisles in parking lots shall be appropriately demarcated as shown in Exhibit 8.
L.
Landscaping. Planting design should reflect and enhance the natural surroundings of each site as well as the design objectives of the building. Existing trees and native groundcover should be preserved wherever possible and integrated into the overall landscape design. Existing plant materials that are to be retained shall be clearly designated on the landscape plans and their root zones and tree canopies shall be adequately protected from damage or destruction during construction using suitable barricades or fencing. Newly planted trees, shrubs and groundcover materials used in landscaped areas shall be selected from the approved plant list in the appendix unless otherwise approved by the planning director.
Plant materials shall be of a size, species and variety specified in the approved plant list in the appendix unless otherwise approved by the planning director. Street trees must be a minimum of three-and-one-half-inch caliper as measured at six (6) inches above ground and help to articulate the pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems. Except for perpendicular crossings of driveways and utility easements. Street trees shall be planted with a spacing not to exceed thirty (30) feet. Street trees shall not be placed closer than eight feet from a building, driveway, light standard, sign standard, post, fire hydrant, or other permanent structure.
Evergreen groundcover planting shall be used on all slopes steeper than two and one-half (2½) to one (1) to aid in erosion control.
Landscape planting and irrigation plans must be prepared by a landscape architect registered in the State of Georgia for each application for a land-disturbance permit.
Transitional buffer zone—Where the transitional buffer zone is well vegetated and provides an adequate visual screen at eye level, it shall be undisturbed. Otherwise, the transitional buffer zone shall be either planted with double staggered rows of approved evergreen trees and shrubbery to form a dense visual screen or the existing vegetation shall be enhanced with native landscaping and groundcover adequate to provide an effective visual screen at eye level from adjacent properties. However, transitional buffer zones may be interrupted where necessary for perpendicular crossings of streets, fences, driveways utilities, and trails, bikeways or pedestrian ways.
Parking lot landscaping—The total length of any parking area facing a street shall be separated from the street by landscaping, including evergreen shrubbery at least eighteen (18) inches in height. Off-street parking lots shall be designed to maximize coverage by shade trees. Shade trees in parking lots shall be a minimum of two-and-one-half-inch caliper as measured at six (6) inches above ground. Off-street parking areas shall provide landscape islands and perimeter landscape strips that provide a cumulative total of at least one (1) shade tree per six (6) parking spaces. Each shade tree shall be planted in a planting area at least eight (8) feet wide. The planting area for a tree shall consist of permeable and well-drained soils with suitable ground cover that provides a minimum of one hundred (100) square feet for the roots of each large tree and fifty (50) square feet for the roots of each small tree. Landscape materials suitable for parking areas shall be selected from the approved plant list in the appendix unless otherwise approved by the planning director.
Irrigation—All newly planted landscape areas (including parking lot islands) shall be irrigated by a fully automatic, commercial, underground irrigation system in according with the following standards:
1.
All irrigation systems shall be provided with backflow preventers approved by DeKalb County. Such devices shall be located or screened so that they are not visible or accessible to the public from adjacent sidewalks, streets, alleys, or parking lots.
2.
Spray heads shall be located to provide one hundred (100) percent, overlapping coverage. Overspray onto sidewalks and other paved areas should be minimized.
3.
Control boxes and panels shall be located inside buildings or where they will not be visible or subject to vandalism.
