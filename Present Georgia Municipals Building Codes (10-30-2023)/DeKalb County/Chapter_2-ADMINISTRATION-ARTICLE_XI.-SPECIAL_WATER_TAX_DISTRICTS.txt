ARTICLE XI. - SPECIAL WATER TAX DISTRICTS

Sec. 2-500. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
Article IX, section II, paragraph VI of the Georgia Constitution gives the governing authority the power to create special districts for the provision of local government services within such districts, and to levy and collect taxes within such districts to pay for the cost of providing such services.
(b)
Private water systems collect, pump, and distribute treated potable water.
(c)
If a private water system is deficient and in need of repair, water main leaks and breaks can occur. Often, private water systems are not constructed in compliance with current county specifications, and are not repaired in a manner that reduces or eliminates water main leaks and breaks.
(d)
When water main leaks and breaks occur in private water systems, the county's public water system may experience contamination, lower pressure, deterioration and wastage, which adversely affects water quality and jeopardizes the health and welfare of county citizens.
(e)
The governing authority finds that failing private water systems may create potentially significant public health and safety hazards for all residents of the county. The governing authority further finds that costs associated with private water main leaks and breaks can be burdensome and, thus, it is in the best interests of all residents of the county to assist in the repair and upgrade of failing private water systems so that such systems can be incorporated into the county's public water system.
(f)
To achieve this public purpose, the governing authority wants to make available a process to correct the failings in private water systems and thereafter incorporate these private water systems into the county's public water system.
(g)
This article establishes a process to improve, regulate, maintain and operate water systems in special water tax districts (hereinafter referred to as "water tax districts") comprised of defined areas of the unincorporated county served by failing private water systems, as that term is defined in this article.
(h)
Once a water tax district is created and the county repairs and upgrades the failing private water system, then the chief executive officer shall formally accept the private water system into the county's public water system. After the water improvements are completed, and the cost of the repair and upgrade is fully paid by the collection of taxes within the water tax district, then the water tax district shall be dissolved by operation of law.
(i)
Once a failing private water system is upgraded to current specifications and/or repaired and incorporated in the county's public water system, then the governing authority believes that contamination, lower pressure, deterioration and wastage of the county's water supply will be reduced. Therefore, creating special water tax districts as provided in this article protects the health and welfare of the county's citizens by improving the water quality of the county's waterways, and is a cost-efficient method of reducing water line breaks.
(j)
Nothing in this article shall be construed to require the governing authority to approve any request to establish a water tax district, and it shall be in the sole legislative judgment of the governing authority to approve the establishment of any such water tax district.
(k)
Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the governing authority from creating a water tax district if it determines that the water tax district is required to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the county, and it shall be in the sole legislative judgment of the governing authority to make a determination to establish any such water tax district.
(l)
This article shall not be used to create a water tax district to repair individual water service lines or laterals that run from a public or private water main to a structure, as such water service lines or laterals are regulated in chapter 25 of this Code. Repair, upgrade, and replacement of such water service lines or laterals remain the responsibility of the owner of the structure.
(m)
Nothing in this article shall be construed to provide a mechanism to create water tax districts to service property that houses apartments, or to service a commercial, business, industrial, or office structure, enterprise or development.
( Ord. No. 13-10 , Pt. I, 5-28-13)
Sec. 2-501. - Definitions.

Apartment means a building containing four (4) or more independent, self-contained, residential units; each independent, self-contained, residential unit must be comprised of one (1) or more rooms, designed, occupied or intended for occupancy as separate living quarters, with cooking, sleeping, and bathroom facilities. The term "apartment" does not include a condominium as that term is defined in state law.
Complete petition means a petition that includes: (i) the signatures of the required number of owners of the property lying within the proposed water tax district in favor of such designation; and (ii) an accurate description of the property to be included in the proposed water tax district, including tax map parcel identification numbers, as used by the tax assessor and the tax commissioner. The petition is subject to verification of property owner signature(s) and property owner(s) boundary lines by the director of watershed management.
Costs or costs incurred within a water tax district means the actual cost of designing, repairing, upgrading and constructing the water improvements in the water tax district, including the actual cost of surveying; engineering design; fee simple, right-of-way and/or easement acquisition; construction, financing, legal, interest and other related expenses; and the county's administrative costs. Costs shall be amortized over a period of ten (10) years for each individual water tax district.
Failing private water system means a private water system that has been determined to be in need of repair and deficient in a written, sealed engineering report prepared by a civil engineer licensed by the State of Georgia.

Sec. 2-509. - Calculation of taxes to be assessed in the water tax district.
(a)
The property owners in the water tax district collectively shall pay fifty (50) percent of the costs incurred within a water tax district, but in no event shall each property owner's share of costs exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500.00). The county shall pay fifty (50) percent of the same costs, or a greater amount if necessary to enforce the seven thousand five hundred dollar ($7,500.00) cap. Each property owner in the water tax district shall be responsible for and pay his/her pro rata share of the costs, which shall be divided equally among all property owners within such district on the basis of the number of lots, whether improved or unimproved, or on the basis of the number of condominium units, as that term is defined by state law. Owners of exempt properties shall not be included in the calculation of costs.
(b)
Each year, the finance director shall be responsible for calculating each property owner's annual pro rata share of the costs, in accordance with the provisions of this article. The tax commissioner shall be responsible for collecting from the property owners payment of their pro rata share of the fifty (50) percent of costs incurred within a water tax district. The finance director and tax commissioner shall be notified by the executive assistant at such time as the water tax district is approved to commence the collection and receipt of monies in payment of estimated assessment rates. Beginning January 1 of the year following the creation of the tax district and for each year thereafter, the tax statement issued to each such property owner shall include a separate line item tax showing each property owner's annual pro rata share of the costs until paid. When all work within an approved water tax district is complete, the finance director and tax commissioner shall adjust estimated assessment rates pursuant to subsection 2-508(c) to reflect all costs incurred within a water tax district.
(c)
The fifty (50) percent of costs, as limited by the seven thousand five hundred dollar ($7,500.00) cap, shall be the special services water tax and shall become due and payable at the same time that other county taxes are due and payable. If such tax remains unpaid, the tax commissioner shall have the authority to issue a writ of fieri facias or execution against the property served, which writ shall have the same lien dignity and priority as writs of fieri facias or executions issued for other county taxes. Each annual special services water tax shall become a lien against the property served on January 1 of each year in the same manner that a lien attaches for other county taxes, and such lien shall cover the property of the owner until such special services water tax is paid. Any unpaid amount shall accrue penalty, interest and charges in the same manner and at the same rate as other delinquent county taxes.
