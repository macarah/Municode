Editor's note— Ordinance No. 89-21, adopted May 23, 1989, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, inclusion of § 1 as Art. IV, Div. 7, §§ 25-301—25-306, was at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 25-301. - Declaration of policy.
O.C.G.A. section 12-5-27.1 provides that whenever a local government entity is required by the environmental protection division to reduce phosphorus in its wastewater being discharged into the waters of the state, such local government entity shall pass an ordinance mandating the retail sale of low phosphorus household laundry detergent as part of its phosphorus reduction process. It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the county to encourage the use of clean phosphate-free household laundry detergents and to prohibit the sale of household laundry detergents which contain more than five-tenths (0.5) percent phosphorus by weight. The county finds that such use and sale will be a cost-effective way to reduce the amount of phosphorus in wastewater discharge so as to protect Georgia's rivers and lakes downstream; promote health, safety, and welfare; and prevent injury to human health, plant and animal life, and property. It is vital to the health, well-being, and welfare of present and future inhabitants of the county that these sources be protected against contamination and pollution.
