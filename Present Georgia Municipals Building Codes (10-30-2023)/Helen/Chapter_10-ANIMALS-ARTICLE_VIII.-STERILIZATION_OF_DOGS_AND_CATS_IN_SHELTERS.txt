ARTICLE VIII. - STERILIZATION OF DOGS AND CATS IN SHELTERS

Sec. 10-81. - Policy.
The board of commissioners finds that the breeding of dogs and cats acquired from animal shelters, animal control agencies, humane societies or public and private animal refuges results in the birth of thousands of animals who become strays, suffer privation and death, constitute a public nuisance and health hazard, and ultimately, are impounded and destroyed at great public expense.
