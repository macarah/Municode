(a)
Front yard: No parking areas, structures, fences or patios shall be allowed in the first ten feet of a front yard, measured from the street or highway right-of-way. A five-foot wide sidewalk shall be constructed in this area parallel to the street or highway when it is not feasible to construct a five-foot wide sidewalk parallel to the street or highway within the street or highway right-of-way. The design of the remaining area of this ten-foot strip shall follow the criteria found under the definition of a yard. The remainder of the front yard can have parking and/or drive through and walk to the building entrance, if a three-foot landscape strip can be placed next to the building. The parking and drive area layout must follow the parking criteria in section 34-254. A patio can be constructed between the ten-foot strip and the building. No fences can be constructed between the ten-foot strip and the building except if the project is allowed a buffer along the side property line in conformance with the buffer criteria defined in this section. Should buildings on the property be existing, and be located on the property that will not allow this criteria to be complied with, the planning design and review board shall review a submitted design of the front yard, and make a recommendation to the city council for granting a variance, based on the best interest of the community and the property owner.
(b)
Side yard: No structures shall be allowed in a side yard. Parking and/or a drive through and/or walk to the building entrance is permitted in a side yard, if a six-foot landscaped strip can be placed between the side property line and the parking and/or drive through and/or walk area, and a three-foot landscaped strip can be placed between the parking and/or drive through and/or walk and the building.

The purpose and intent of this section is to preserve and/or create as much natural vegetative environment as possible; therefore, all zones must have a coverage of tree dripline area of no less than 25 percent of the total property area (excluding the area of the building footprint plus 15 feet around the building perimeter). The following requirements shall be met:

(2)
In areas where no trees exist, hardwood trees of at least eight feet in height, indigenous to the area must be planted, and which upon maturity will provide the minimum coverage in subsection (a) above. Placement of trees to be planted must be clearly shown on the landscaping plan.
(b)
Meeting the initial minimum requirements of subsection (a) also requires the proper treatment and protection of trees used to meet this requirement. This means that if any tree used to meet the requirement dies within five years of the approval for development, it must be replaced by a tree of at least eight feet in height and the new tree must meet the same five-year requirement.
