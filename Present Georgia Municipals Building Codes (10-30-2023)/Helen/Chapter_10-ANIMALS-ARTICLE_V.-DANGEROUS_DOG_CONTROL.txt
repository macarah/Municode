It is unlawful for an owner to have or possess within the county a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog without a certificate of registration issued in accordance with the provisions of this section.

Subject to the additional requirements of subsection (c) of this section for dangerous dogs, the animal control officer shall issue a certificate of registration to the owner of such dog if the owner notifies the animal control officer or the animal control officer otherwise finds sufficient evidence of:
(1)
A proper enclosure to confine the dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog; and
(2)
The posting of the premises where the dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog is located with a clearly visible sign warning that there is a dangerous dog on the property. The sign required shall conform substantially to the design provided by the department of natural resources.

In addition to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a dangerous dog shall present to the animal control officer evidence of:
(1)
A policy for insurance in the amount of at least $500,000.00 with a maximum deductible of $100.00 issued by an insurer authorized and approved by the state insurance commissioner to transact business in the state that insures the owner of the dangerous dog against liability for any personal injuries including but not limited to death, and property damage inflicted by the dangerous dog. A dangerous dog has the potential of deadly force, and for this reason liability insurance policies that unduly restrict coverage as to any personal injuries and property damage as determined by the animal control officer shall be deemed to not meet the insurance requirements of this subsection. The determination of the animal control officer as to whether the exclusion unduly restricts the liability coverage will be based upon the following facts:
a.
A dangerous dog is capable of deadly force;
b.
The intent of this subsection is that there be liability coverage for any personal injuries including death and any property damage inflicted by the dangerous dog;
c.
The nature of the exclusions contained within the policy; and

A dangerous dog has the potential of deadly force, and for this reason surety bonds that unduly restrict coverage as to any personal injuries and property damage as determined by the animal control officer shall be deemed to not meet the liability bond requirements of this subsection. The determination of the animal control officer as to whether the exclusion unduly restricts the liability bond coverage will be based upon the following facts:
a.
A dangerous dog is capable of deadly force;
b.
The intent of this subsection is that there be liability bond coverage for any personal injuries and any property damage inflicted by the dangerous dog;
c.
The nature of the exclusions contained within the bond; and
d.
Any other reasonable factor that may be considered in achieving the intent of this subsection that there be liability bond coverage for any personal injuries and any property damage inflicted by the dangerous dog; and

(g)
An animal control officer is authorized to make whatever inquiry is deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this article.
