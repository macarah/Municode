Whenever a request is filed with the building inspector by a public authority or by at least five residents of the city charging that any dwelling, building, or structure is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use or whenever it appears to the building inspector, (from his own motion), that any dwelling, building, or structure is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use or is vacant, dilapidated, and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, the building inspector shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and any parties in interest in such dwelling, buildings, or structure a complaint stating the charges in that respect and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the building inspector, (or his designated agent), at a place within the city, fixed not less than ten days nor more than 30 days after the serving of said complaint; that the owner and any parties in interest shall be given the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint; and that the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the building inspector.
(b)
If, after such notice and hearing, the building inspector determines that the dwelling, building, or structure under consideration is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use or is vacant, dilapidated, and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and caused to be served upon the owner and parties in interest thereof an order:
(1)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner or parties in interest, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to render it fit for human habitation or for current commercial, industrial, or business use or to vacate and close the dwelling, building, or structure as a human habitation; or
(2)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner or parties in interest, within the time specified in the order, to remove or demolish dwelling, building, or structure.
In no event shall the city commission require removal or demolition of any dwelling, building, or structure except upon a finding that the cost of repair, alteration, or improvement thereof exceeds one- half the value such dwelling, building, or structure will have when repaired to satisfy the minimum requirements of this article.
(c)
If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with an order to vacate and close or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the building inspector may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or the [dwelling, building or structure] be vacated and closed or demolished; and that building inspector may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any building, dwelling, or structure so closed a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use; the use or occupation of this building for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use is prohibited and unlawful.
(d)
If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with an order to remove or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the building inspector may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be removed or demolished; provided, however, that the duties of the building inspector, set forth in paragraph (c) and this paragraph, shall not be exercised until the city commission shall have by ordinance ordered the building inspector to proceed to effectuate the purpose of Article VIII with respect to the particular property or properties which the building inspector shall have found to be unfit for human habitation or unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use, which property or properties shall be described in the ordinance;
(e)
The amount of the cost of such vacating and closing or removal or demolition by the building inspector shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Said lien shall attach to the real property upon the payment of all costs of demolition by the city and the filing of an itemized statement of the total sum of said costs by the building inspector in the office of the clerk of the city upon a lien docket maintained by the clerk for such purposes. If the dwelling, building, or structure is removed or demolished by the building inspector, he shall sell the materials of such dwellings, buildings, or structures and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the removal or demolition and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the building inspector, shall be secured in such manner as may be directed by such court, and shall be disbursed by such court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of such court. Nothing herein shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause the removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
(f)
The city may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for removal or demolition of dwellings, buildings, or structures only in the following manner:
(1)
The owner or parties in interest shall be allowed to satisfy the amount due on such lien by paying to the city, within 30 days after the perfection of said lien, a sum of money equal to 25 percent of the total amount due and by further paying to the city the remaining balance due on such lien, together with interest at the rate of seven percent per annum, in three equal annual payments, each of which shall become due and payable on the anniversary date of the initial payment made as hereinabove prescribed;
(2)
Should the property upon which such lien is perfected be sold, transferred, or conveyed by the owner or parties in interest at any time prior to the termination of the said three-year period, then the entire balance due on such lien shall be due and payable to the city; and
(3)
Should the amount due on such lien, or any portion thereof, be unpaid after the passage of said 3 year period, or upon the occurrence of the contingency provided for in subparagraph (2) above, the City may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for alteration, repair, removal, or demolition of dwellings, buildings, or structures in the same manner as provided in O.C.G.A. 48-5-358 and other applicable state statutes.
