ARTICLE IX. - DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS

Sec. 46-151. - Philosophy.
(a)
The supervising elected official or a department manager is responsible for the proper and efficient operation of his/her department and for enforcing all policies and regulations. It is the responsibility of all employees to observe the policies and regulations.
(b)
Disciplinary action may be imposed upon an employee for conduct or actions, which interfere with or prevent the effective and efficient performance of a department's responsibilities. The purpose of such disciplinary action shall be to effect a correction of an employee's conduct rather than to be punitive.
(c)
The type and severity of disciplinary action shall be related to the gravity of the offense, the employee's record of disciplinary action, length of service, and actions taken in similar cases both within the department and in other departments. Adverse action taken must be based on cause supported by sufficient evidence, be consistent with other such actions taken and be fair and equitable.
(Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04)
Sec. 46-152. - Authority for disciplinary action.
The county manager, department manager or supervising elected official is authorized to apply such disciplinary measures as may be appropriate and necessary. In cases of reduction in pay, suspension, demotion and dismissal, the department manager or elected official shall consult the director of human resources or county manager. This requirement for consultation is not intended to relieve the department manager or elected official of responsibility or to preclude the immediate suspension of an employee when emergency or other circumstances make it impractical to obtain prior consultation.
(Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04)
Sec. 46-153. - Reasons for disciplinary action.

Sec. 46-154. - Types of disciplinary action.
Disciplinary action should only be taken to the extent necessary to correct a problem. Types of disciplinary action from the least severe to the most severe are:

(2)
Written reprimand;
(3)
Probation;
(4)
Suspension;

(Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04)
Sec. 46-155. - Procedures for disciplinary action.
(a)
Oral reprimand.
(1)
Whenever grounds for disciplinary action exist and the supervisor determines that the incident, action or behavior of the employee is such that more severe disciplinary action is not immediately necessary, the supervisor should orally communicate to the employee the supervisor's observation of the problem and offer assistance in correcting the situation.
(2)
When an oral reprimand is given, the supervisor should ensure that the employee's personnel file is documented to show date and nature of the reprimand. The employee should be advised that the reprimand will be documented in the personnel file and that he/she may submit comments for the file.
(3)
Depending on the circumstances or seriousness of the offense, normally no more than two oral reprimands should be given to an employee for the same type of offense, after which a more severe type of disciplinary action should be taken. Whenever possible, however, sufficient time for improvement should be allowed before further and/or more severe action is taken.
(b)
Written reprimand.
(1)
When a supervisor determines that a written reprimand is appropriate and necessary, the reprimand shall be addressed to the employee and shall include:
a.
The charge;
b.
The specific behavior;
c.
The dates of the behavior that support the charge;
d.
The warning that continuance of this behavior will result in more severe disciplinary action;
e.
An offer of assistance in correcting the behavior; and
f.
Circumstances affecting the severity of the discipline.
(2)
A signed copy of the reprimand shall be included in the employee's personnel file in the human resources office. The employee shall have the opportunity to submit written comments to be included in the file and request review by next level supervisor if any.
(c)
Probation. The supervising elected official or the county manager has the authority to place an employee on probation for a period up to one hundred eighty (180) days. Such action shall be considered the equivalent of a final written warning.
(d)
Suspensions. Personnel, who are suspended, with or without pay, will continue to be entitled to the health insurance coverage they were authorized under the county's group policy prior to the suspension, until such time as the suspension is resolved.
(1)
Misdemeanor or felony. When an employee has been charged with a crime classified as a misdemeanor or felony, the supervising elected official or department manager shall:
a.
Review the nature of the employee's offense;
b.
Assess the impact of the crime on the ability of the employee to perform the duties of his/her position in a satisfactory manner;
c.
Determine whether continued service would put the public in jeopardy;
d.
Assess the impact upon the reputation and good name of the county;
e.
Consult with the director of human resources regarding actions to be taken; and
f.
If appropriate, suspend the employee until disposition of the charge or charges. If a suspension is granted under this section, the employee may be required to pay health and insurance payments.
(2)
Disciplinary action. When a supervising elected official or department manager determines that suspension is an appropriate corrective action, an employee may be suspended for up to 30 workdays. Ordinarily, an initial suspension for a particular offense will not exceed three to five work days depending on the seriousness of the offense. A 30-day suspension would normally be imposed only for the most serious and flagrant of offenses or as the last in a series of progressively more severe suspensions.
(3)
Written notice.
a.
On or before the effective date of the suspension, the supervising elected official or department manager will provide the employee with a written statement setting forth:
1.
The reasons for the suspension;
2.
The effective date of the suspension;
3.
The date the employee should return to work;
4.
The warning that continuance of this behavior will result in more severe disciplinary action;
5.
An offer of assistance in correcting the behavior;
6.
Circumstances affecting the severity of the discipline; and
7.
Advice on the right of appeal.
b.
Except in the case of suspension with pay and emergency suspensions, the employee shall have an opportunity to present at least oral reasons why he/she should not be suspended, which shall be considered before determining whether a suspension shall be imposed.
(4)
Types of suspension.
a.
Suspension with pay.
1.
Whenever there is reason to believe that an employee may have committed a serious violation or offense, but sufficient evidence is not yet available to make a proper evaluation and determination of the appropriate final action, the supervising elected official or department manager may suspend an employee for up to ten workdays pending investigation with pay.
2.
In certain circumstances, the supervising elected official or department manager may determine that even though a suspension without pay may not be appropriate, it is nonetheless necessary to relieve the employee of duties and remove him/her from the work site. In such a case, a suspension with pay may be given the employee for up to five workdays.
3.
The county manager or supervising elected official may authorize a suspension with pay for any period that may be deemed necessary.
b.
Suspension without pay. The supervising elected official or department manager shall give their employee the opportunity to present at least oral reasons why he/she should not be suspended without pay before determining whether a suspension shall be imposed. A supervising elected official or county manager may suspend an employee without pay.
c.
Emergency suspension. If an emergency exists which makes immediate suspension of an employee necessary before concurrence can be obtained; to preserve the health and safety of the employee or others; or to continue vital services to the public; or to continue a county function without serious disruption, a supervising elected official or a department manager may make such an immediate suspension.
(5)
Restoration to active duty. At the end of the period of suspension, the employee shall be returned to active duty at his/her previous salary rate unless other disciplinary action affecting the position and/or salary has been taken.
(e)
Reduction in pay. In the event that a reduction in pay is warranted, the employee will be given advanced notification of this pending action and given the opportunity to respond. When a supervising elected official or department manager has obtained the required concurrences and determines that an employee's performance or conduct is of such nature that it can best be corrected through a reduction of pay within grade, the employee shall be advised in writing of such action as follows:
(1)
The reasons for such action;
(2)
The extent of the reduction;
(3)
The effective date;
(4)
Previous warnings, counseling and attempts to correct the situation; and
(5)
Advice on the right of appeal.
(f)
Demotion. In the event that a demotion is warranted, the employee will be given advanced notification of the pending action and given the opportunity to respond. A supervising elected official or department manager may determine that demotion of an employee to a position in a lower pay grade is a proper action to correct a situation. In such a case, supervising elected official or the department manager shall furnish the employee with a statement of the reasons for such action and the effective date at least three (3) days before the proposed date of the action. The statement shall fully set forth:
(1)
The reasons for the demotion;
(2)
Previous warnings, counseling and attempts to correct the problem;
(3)
Notification of the employee's right of appeal.
(g)
Dismissal.
(1)
When dismissal is warranted, the employee will be given advanced notification of this pending action and given the opportunity to respond.
(2)
An employee may be dismissed when:
a.
All reasonable attempts at corrective action have been ineffectual;
b.
The seriousness of and the circumstances surrounding the offense leave dismissal as the only feasible alternative;
c.
The employee is no longer able to perform one or more duties required by his/her position due to loss of required license, permit or certification.
(3)
A dismissal shall be effective only after the supervising elected Official or department manager has consulted with the director of human resources and has presented the employee with the reasons for dismissal in writing specifically and fully stated.
(4)
The supervising elected official or department manager shall notify the employee of the right to appeal.
