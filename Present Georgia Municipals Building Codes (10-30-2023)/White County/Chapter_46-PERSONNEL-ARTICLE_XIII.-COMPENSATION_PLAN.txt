Sec. 46-256. - Maintenance of the compensation plan.
(a)
The county, or its designated agency, shall periodically make studies of pay practices by a sampling of public and private sector employers in the labor markets in which county employees are recruited. The county shall utilize the information in the evaluation of assignments of grade levels and pay ranges and in proposing amendments to the salary schedules.
(b)
Factors relevant in maintaining a sound, fair, and equitable compensation plan include ranges of pay in other classes, prevailing rates of pay for similar employment in both public and private organizations in the labor markets, other benefits received by employees, the financial and economic considerations existing, and the ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel.

(c)
When an employee is transferred from one position to another in the same grade level or to a position in another grade level, he/she shall continue to be paid at the same rate of pay.
(Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04)
Sec. 46-260. - Reinstatement and re-employment.
A reinstated or re-employed employee shall be paid at a salary rate within the pay range to which the position is assigned.
