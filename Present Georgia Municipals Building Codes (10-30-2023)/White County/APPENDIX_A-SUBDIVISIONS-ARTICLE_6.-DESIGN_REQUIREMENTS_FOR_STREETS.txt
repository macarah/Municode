ARTICLE 6. - DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR STREETS

Section 601. - Access.
Every subdivision shall be accessed by a public street, or class I street, or a previously approved access of at least a 30-foot easement (a private street). This may include the extension of previously approved subdivision streets.
If the planning commission or administrative official finds that inadequate access exists, the subdivider's remedy is to pursue the proper access to the subdivision by upgrading the access road to the subdivision. This shall require improving the access to current county road standards. In such cases of inadequate access, street or access improvements are required. A preliminary plat for the subdivision shall be required, regardless of the number of lots.
Where existing streets serving the subdivision are inadequate to serve the additional traffic, the planning commission or administrative officer shall not approve the subdivision unless adequate access improvements are provided by the subdivider, which shall require improvements to county standards.
Section 602. - Lot frontage.
Each lot shall abut upon a public street or an approved subdivision street and at a minimum, have 60 feet of lot frontage. In the case of a lot fronting on and accessed by a, cul-de-sac, the minimum lot frontage may be reduced to 35 feet. Double or reverse frontage lots are required to have proper frontage on all sides that could be used as access.
Section 603. - Conformance to adopted major thoroughfare and other plans.
All streets and other features of the adopted comprehensive plan shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and if any, to the dimensions indicated on the major thoroughfare plan or transportation element of the comprehensive plan adopted by the county board of commissioners.
Section 604. - Continuation of existing streets.
Existing streets shall be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width, when new streets are constructed.
Section 605. - Tract plan for future streets and phases.
Where the land proposed to be subdivided or developed includes only part of the tract owned or intended for subdivision or development by the subdivider or land developer, a tentative plan of a future street system for the portion not slated for immediate subdivision or land development consideration shall be required by the administrative officer. When such tentative plan is required, it shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider or land developer at the time of submission of an application for preliminary plat or development plan approval, whichever occurs first.
Section 606. - Street names.
Street names shall be reviewed for correct usage and reasonable meanings consistent with the language used and are subject to the approval of the GIS/mapping department.
Section 607. - Street alignment, intersections, and jogs.
Streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing streets. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles (90 degrees), but in no case shall such a street intersection be less than 75 degrees. Where street offsets or jogs cannot be avoided, offset "T" intersections shall be separated by a minimum centerline offset of 300 feet.
Section 608. - Development along arterial street or limited access highway.
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an arterial street or a limited access highway, the Administrative Officer or Planning Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way as a marginal access street, from which the lots shall be accessed instead of the arterial street or limited access highway. In such cases, the Administrative Officer or Planning Commission shall require a ten-foot-wide, no-access easement planted to prohibit travel across it.
Section 609. - Alleys.
Alleys may be required at the rear of all lots used for multi-family, commercial or industrial developments. Alleys may be provided in one or two-family residential developments.

All street rights-of-way outside of the paved portions shall be graded to conform to the approved cross section and shall be soiled and grassed with a material acceptable to the director of public works.
The director of public works may require that drainage facilities be installed to provide a stable subsurface and base for fills and base course construction over wet weather springs, soft spots, and other unstable soils. The director of public works may require the subdivider or land developer to submit a soil analysis and drainage design performed by an engineering firm.
Section 624. - Street trees.
Street tree planting is required along all new collector and arterial streets in the county and private streets within commercial and industrial subdivisions. Street trees are optional but recommended in all other subdivisions. Trees should not encroach upon right-of-way or interfere with future maintenance by the county should the road become a public street.
When required or where provided, the subdivider, owner of land to be dedicated as a public street, or the developer of a street shall at the time of preliminary plat approval submit a plan for the provision of street trees. It is the intent of this section that the subdivider carefully position street trees on the plan while taking into account future driveway and sidewalk locations, if provided. Suitable arrangements must be made for either the subdivider/developer or individual builders to install street trees according to a plan approved by the public works department as a part of preliminary plat approval, prior to dedication or opening of said street, or by the administrative official if a preliminary plat is not required. It is the preference of the county that the subdivider shall install said street trees prior to the dedication or opening of the public or private street; however, the planning commission may accept an agreement where the responsibility for street tree planting is shifted to the owners or individual builders of the lots to be subdivided. Any such responsibility shall be legally transferred in a form acceptable to the county attorney.
Street trees and other shrubbery that may be retained or planted shall be placed or retained so as not to obstruct sight distances at street intersections.
Section 625. - Sidewalks.
Though not required, if sidewalks are employed in a subdivision they shall have a minimum width of four feet and shall be provided under the following conditions:

b.
All driveway aprons over sidewalk areas shall be installed with concrete by the developer or builder.
c.
Sidewalks thickness and material shall be determined by the public works department. Except as specified, alternative materials may be used, but must be approved by the public works department.
Section 626. - Street lights.
Street lights are not required but may be provided in accordance with county specifications by the developer of a subdivision prior to the approval of a final plat; provided however, that within mountain and/or hillside development areas as designed by resolution of the board of commissioners, low level street lights shall allowed in key areas and intersections. Fixtures and standards/poles installed or used shall be approved by the utility company which will be responsible for the maintenance of the facilities and by the director of public works. The fixtures shall be mounted no more than 30 feet above the ground and shall have appropriate arm length or power to place light over the street. Post-top luminaries may be permitted when approved by the director of public works. Fixtures shall be located no more than 500 feet apart, unless approved by the director of public works, and when provided at least one light shall be located at each public or private street intersection within the subdivision or land development.
The developer, or homeowners' association, shall pay all costs for poles, fixtures and any other related items or materials necessary for the installation of street lights, as well as arrange an agreement with the utility company for complete maintenance of all installations.
Section 627. - Deceleration lanes.
For subdivisions or land developments accessing state routes, the state department of transportation may require the installation of deceleration lanes.
The director of public works may require the installation of a deceleration lane for a distance of 100 feet and a 50-foot taper from all project entrances serving commercial and industrial subdivisions, and residential subdivisions serving 50 lots or more for accessing county roads. For all commercial properties, if an acceleration/ deceleration lane is not required, the subdivider or land developer may be required to construct a wide entrance according specifications of the director of public works.
Section 628. - Improvements to abutting streets.
For subdivisions and land developments that abut and access an abutting public street, the subdivider or land developer shall install road improvements according to standards and specifications of the director of public works along all abutting streets.
When a subdivision or land development uses or proposes to use an unpaved public right-of-way for access, the subdivider or land developer shall dedicate right-of-way and improve that right-of-way to right-of-way and pavement widths consistent with county street design standards.
Section 629. - Residential driveways.
All entrances or exits of any driveway from or to any state or federal highway shall be subject to the approval of the state department of transportation. Any driveway that will abut a public street must obtain a driveway permit from the county public works. Public works will determine if the chosen driveway location is the best available for sight distance and will evaluate the correct size for the driveway culvert or give permission to omit the culvert.
Section 630. - Nonresidential driveways.
All entrances or exits of any driveway from or to any state or federal highway shall be subject to the approval of the state department of transportation.
