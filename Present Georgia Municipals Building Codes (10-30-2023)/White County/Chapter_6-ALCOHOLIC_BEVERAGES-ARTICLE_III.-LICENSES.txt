Such taxes shall be collected by the licensee under this chapter and any such licensees shall remit the same to the county clerk on or before the tenth day of the succeeding month along with the appropriate returns showing a summary of the licensee's gross sales derived from the sale of distilled spirits by the drink. Gross sales shall include, all credit card sales and those sales shall be reported and taxes collected thereon shall be submitted to the county clerk or designee to the same extent as required of cash sales.
It shall be duty of each licensee required to make a report and pay any tax levy hereunder to keep and preserve suitable records of the sales taxable under this section, and such other books or accounts as may be necessary to determine the amount of the tax due. It shall be the duty of every licensee to keep and preserve such records for a period of three years and to provide such returns and reports as may be required by the county clerk or designee. Licensees collecting the tax provided for in this section shall be allowed a percentage of the tax due and accounted for and shall be reimbursed in the form of a deduction in submitting, reporting and paying the amount due, if the amount is not delinquent at the time of payment. The rate of deduction should be the same rate authorized for deductions from state tax under chapter 8 of title 48 as provided in O.C.G.A. § 3-4-133. The county clerk is hereby authorized to create such reports and returns as may be necessary to adequately provide for the collection of the excise tax provided in this section.
In the event the county clerk or designee deems it necessary to verify the excise tax submitted to the county pursuant to this section, for any month, he or she shall notify the licensee of such need for verification and the licensee shall submit a verified comprehensive report to the county clerk or designee, prepared by an auditor, reflecting all sales under this section by the licensee and the taxes submitted to the county. The licensee shall have 30 days to submit such a report to the county clerk or designee following such a request.

Entities selling malt beverages to retail package and/or consumption on the premises licensees shall substitute "state form ATT-122" for the summary of sales.
