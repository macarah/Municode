No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

Secs. 26-87—26-115. - Reserved.
ARTICLE IV. - MINORS

Sec. 26-116. - Title.
This article shall be known and referred to as the "City of Wrens Juvenile Evening Curfew Ordinance."
(Code 2002, § 3-6-1; Ord. No. 01-007-2009, § 3(3-6-1), 7-14-2009)
Sec. 26-117. - Purpose.
The mayor and council have determined that there has been an increase in juvenile violence and crime by persons under the age of 17 years in the city resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior; that persons under the age of 17 years are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful activity and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime; that there has been a significant breakdown in the supervision and guidance normally provided by parents for minors resulting in an increase in crime, substance abuse, school drop out rates, juvenile pregnancy, and other illicit behavior. The city has an obligation to provide for the protection of minors from each other and from other persons, for the enforcement of parental control over and responsibility for children, for the protection of the general public, and for the reduction of the incidence of juvenile criminal activities which are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances. The mayor and council have determined that a curfew for those under the age of 17 years will be in the interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare and will help to attain the foregoing objectives and to diminish the undesirable impact of such conduct on the citizens of the city and will promote the public good, safety and welfare. Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm and legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had demonstrated effectiveness in many cities. The mayor and council have determined that a curfew ordinance will increase parental responsibility for minors within their control and decrease minor delinquency.
(Code 2002, § 3-6-2; Ord. No. 01-007-2009, § 3(3-6-2), 7-14-2009)

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

The term "emergency errand" includes, but is not limited to, a fire, a natural disaster, or automobile accident, or any situation requiring immediate action to prevent serious bodily injury or loss of life.
