(3)
While 15 days is expressed as a minimum requirement for submission of an application under this article, the city has no intention of suppressing spontaneous free speech activities which, because of their nature and/or need for immediate action, cannot conform to the application process.

The city shall be entitled to recover against the applicant the sums expended by the city for those extraordinary expenses agreed to but not provided by the applicant.
(c)
Insurance requirements.
