8.
Floors.
a.
The floor of the lowest occupied rooms shall be slab on fill, below grade or over a fully enclosed basement or crawlspace. All door and window openings in the fully enclosed basement shall be tightly fitted. If the basement is used as a habitable living area, the doors and windows must conform to the standards given above for these elements. All crawlspace vents must incorporate a plywood backing plate of baffle, which prevents a clear line-of-sight from inside to outside without blocking airflow.
9.
Ventilation.
a.
A mechanical ventilation system shall be installed that will provide the minimum air circulation and fresh-air supply requirements for various uses in occupied rooms without the need to open any windows, doors, or other openings to the exterior.
b.
Gravity vent openings in attic shall not exceed Building Code minimum in number and size. The openings shall be fitted with transfer ducts at least three (3) feet in length containing internal sound-absorbing duct lining. Each duct shall have a lined ninety-degree (right angle) bend in the duct such that there is no direct line-of-sight from the exterior through the duct in the attic.
c.
If a fan is used for forced ventilation, the attic inlet and discharge openings shall be fitted with sheet metal transfer ducts of at least twenty-gauge steel, which shall be lined with one-inch-thick coated glass fiber, and shall be at least five (5) feet long with at least one ninety-degree (right angle) bend.
d.
All vent ducts connecting the interior space to the outdoors shall contain at least a ten-foot length of internal sound-absorbing duct lining. Each duct shall be provided with a ninety-degree (right angle) bend in the duct such that there is no direct line-of-sight through the duct from the venting cross-section to the room opening cross-section. Domestic range exhaust ducts to the outside shall be prohibited (see subsection (b)(9)f).
e.
Duct lining shall be coated glass fiber duct liner at least one (1) inch thick.
f.
Range exhaust hoods should incorporate a filtered, air recirculation system rather than ducting to the exterior. Other kitchen exhaust ducts exhaust ducts to the exterior shall contain a baffle plate across the exterior termination which allows proper ventilation. The dimensions of the baffle plate should extend at least one diameter beyond the line-of-sight into the vent duct. The baffle plate shall be of the same material and thickness as the bent duct material.
g.
Building heating units with flues or combustion air vents shall be located in a closet or room closed off from the occupied space by doors.
h.
Doors between occupied space and mechanical equipment areas shall be solid core wood or twenty-gauge steel metal at least one (1) inch thick and shall be fully weatherstripped.
(c)
Upon written application from any applicant for a permit under this chapter, the city building inspector may allow substitute materials ("substitute materials") in lieu of those required in subsection (b) above (the "required materials") so long as both of the following conditions are met:
(1)
The substitute materials will have a STC rating equal to or greater than the STC rating of the required materials; and
(2)
The city building inspector has been convinced that the substitute materials will provide at least as much interior noise protection as the required materials.

Sec. 5-27. - Commercial car wash water recycling requirement.
(a)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to reduce water consumption from commercial car wash facilities by requiring all new conveyor car washes to install operational recycled water systems.
(b)
Applicability. This section shall apply to all conveyor car washes permitted and constructed after January 1, 2011, regardless of the water source. Conveyor car washes permitted and constructed after January 1, 2011, shall have through March 1, 2018 to comply with this section. This section shall not apply to conveyor commercial car washes that were permitted or constructed before January 1, 2011. Additionally, this section shall not apply to self-service car washes or in-bay car washes.
(c)
Definitions. The following words and phrases, whenever used in this section, shall have the following meaning:
"Conveyor car wash" means a commercial car wash where the car moves on a conveyor belt during the wash. The driver of the vehicle can remain in the vehicle or wait outside of the vehicle.
"In-bay car wash" means a commercial car wash where the driver pulls into the bay and parks the car. The vehicle remains stationary while a machine moves back and forth over the vehicle to clean it, instead of the vehicle moving through the tunnel.
"Recycled water system" means a water system that captures and reuses water previously used in wash or rinse cycles.
"Self-service car wash" means a commercial car wash where the customers wash their cars themselves with spray wands and brushes.
(d)
