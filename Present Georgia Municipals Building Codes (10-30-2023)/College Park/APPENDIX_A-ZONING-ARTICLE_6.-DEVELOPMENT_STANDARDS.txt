B.
Facades and exterior walls including sides and backs. The building shall be designed in a way that will reduce the massive scale and uniform and impersonal appearance and will provide visual interest. Long building walls exceeding one hundred (100) feet shall be broken up with projections or recessions having a minimum offset of ten (10) feet horizontal or vertical depth along all sides, and in sufficient number, to reduce the unbroken massing into lengths of approximately forty (40) feet or less along all sides of the building. Projections from the facade may be used as an alternate approach upon approval by the mayor and council.
C.
Street frontage. Along any public street frontage the building design shall include at least one (1) of the following: Windows, arcades, awnings or other acceptable features along at least sixty (60) percent of the building length and appropriately spaced. Arcades and other weather protection features shall be of sufficient depth and height to provide a light-filled and open space along the building frontage. Architectural treatment, similar to that provided to the front facade shall be provided to the sides and rear of the building to mitigate any negative view from any location off-site and any public area (e.g. parking lots, walkways, etc.) on site.
D.
Detail features. The building shall include architectural features that contribute to visual interest at the pedestrian scale and reduce the massive aesthetic effect by breaking up the building wall, front, side, and rear, with color, texture changes, wall offsets, reveals, or projecting ribs.
E.
Roofs. The roof design shall provide variations in rooflines and add interest to, and reduce the massive scale of, large buildings. Roof features shall complement the architectural and visual character of adjoining neighborhoods. Roofs shall include two (2) or more roof planes. Parapet walls shall be architecturally treated to avoid a plain, monotonous look.
F.
Materials and color. The buildings shall have exterior building materials and colors that are aesthetically pleasing and compatible with materials and colors that are used in adjoining neighborhoods or as approved by the mayor and council. This includes the use of high-quality materials and colors that are low reflective, subtle, neutral, or earth tone. Certain types of colors shall be avoided, such as fluorescent or metallic, although brighter colors in limited quantities as building trims and as accents may be considered at the discretion of the planning commission. Construction materials such as tilt-up concrete, smooth-faced concrete block, prefabricated steel panels, and other similar materials shall be avoided unless the exterior surface is covered with an acceptable architectural treatment.
G.
Entryways. The building design shall provide design elements which clearly indicate to customers where the entrances are located and which add aesthetically pleasing character to buildings by providing highly-visible customer entrances.
H.
Screening of mechanical equipment. Mechanical equipment shall be screened to mitigate noise and views in all directions. If roof-mounted, the screen shall be designed to conform architecturally to the design of the building either with varying roof planes or with parapet walls. A wood fence or similar treatment is not acceptable. If ground-mounted, the screen shall be comprised of materials identical to those of the building facade. Screening shall be by use of brick, stone or similar material where applicable.

Delivery and loading spaces. Delivery and loading operations shall be designed and located to mitigate visual and noise impacts to adjoining neighborhoods. If there is a residential use or residentially zoned area adjacent to the site, such operations shall not be permitted between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. the following day. For good cause shown, the planning commission may permit deliveries at additional times provided the applicant submits evidence that sound barriers between all areas for such operations effectively reduce noise emissions to a level of fifty-five (55) Db or less as measured at the lot line of any adjoining residential property. Delivery and loading areas shall be set back from a residential use or residentially zoned property that is adjacent to that site. A landscape buffer of substantial width shall be provided adjacent to the delivery and loading area where it adjoins residential uses or zones. The landscape buffer shall include evergreen shrubs and/or trees plus deciduous canopy trees at regular intervals to provide noise, light, and visual screening. If the delivery and loading spaces are located within an enclosed building or underground, no such setback and buffer area shall be required.
Delivery trucks shall not be parked in close proximity to or within a designated delivery or loading area during non-delivery hours with motor and/or refrigerators/generators running, unless the area where the trucks are parked is set back at least fifty (50) feet from residential property to mitigate the truck noise. Any engine motor idling shall not exceed five (5) minutes.
The delivery and loading areas shall be screened or enclosed so that they are not visible from public streets, public sidewalks, internal pedestrian walkways or adjacent properties.

Outdoor lighting shall provide security, with a minimum illumination of two and four-tenths (2.4) foot-candles of light measured at grade level. This can be accomplished by aiming the lights downward and fitting lights with hoods. The light element shall not protrude below the lower edge of the hood. To minimize any indirect overflow of light on adjacent residential properties, the height of any proposed parking lot light standard shall be as short as possible and shall stair step down to a lower height when close to residential uses or residentially used properties. Lighting standards shall apply as approved by the mayor and council.
T.
Ancillary uses. The applicant must demonstrate that any ancillary uses such as tire shops or snack bars will not have negative impacts on adjacent residential uses, residentially zoned properties, or adjacent properties. Any ancillary use must be oriented to face away from any residential use or residentially zoned property that is adjacent to the site.
