ARTICLE II. - RIDE SHARE
DIVISION 1. - BIKE SHARING INFRASTRUCTURE

Sec. 16-25. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
The public health, safety and welfare will be enhanced by the implementation of a self-service bicycle rental program. The program, which will establish bike sharing infrastructure, both in the public right-of-way and on private property in the City of College Park, and which will be fully paid for by one or more vendors ("providers") selected by the city, will accomplish the city's goals of establishing a positive and useful program for the general public while eliminating city costs and expenses if the city were to directly implement the program.
(b)
The location of bike share infrastructure on public property is intended to increase utilization of other public transit modes by providing a first mile and last mile travel alternative that will increase the range of destinations served.
(c)
The bike sharing experience of the general public will be enhanced by the ability of the city to contract with providers to install and manage bike share infrastructure on public property including the public right-of-way for the installation around the city of multiple rental stations ("stations" or "kiosks") that house rental bicycles.
(d)
The system will allow the general public to rent bicycles from stations located around the city, use a bicycle for trips of varying times and durations and return the bicycle to a different station. Such programs provide a convenience for residents, workers and visitors because bicycles are available on an as-needed basis and are available for one-way trips. The program, made available by the city, can operate on a cooperative basis and link with other programs sponsored by other entities to grow the system quickly and expand the reach of the program beyond the city.
(Ord. No. 2019-04, § 2, 3-18-19)
Sec. 16-26. - Definitions.
The words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. The use of capitalized abbreviated reference terms for the definitions contained herein are intended to refer to the terms and phrases from which they were derived.
Bike sharing rental program means a system funded, managed and operated by one or more providers under contracts entered into with the city, which provide the public with opportunities to rent bicycles from stations at locations on both private and public property including the public right-of-way.
Kiosk means self-service bicycle rental station kiosk which is a structure containing the self-service payment device located at a station at which bicycles are rented.
Provider means a bicycle rental service provider which is a person or entity with a contract with the city to provide self-service bicycle rental services.
Rental bicycle or bicycle means a self-service rental bicycle that is rented from a station that is operated by a private self-service bicycle rental service.
Station means a public self-service bicycle rental station which is an automated facility constructed as a part of a bike sharing rental program where bicycles are made available for rental without the requirement that employees or attendants be present to accept rental payments from customers, rent bicycles to customers, or receive bicycles from customers when the bicycles are returned from rental.
Storage means self-service rental bicycle storage which is a part of a station that is utilized for the storage of rental bicycles available for rental or being returned after rental at any station, including stations maintained by a private self-service bicycle rental service; for the servicing of rental bicycles, or for the storage of any goods or materials, provided that no part of any station may be used for the storage of rental bicycles that are inoperable or which cannot be rented within twenty-four (24) hours after their return.

Sec. 16-27. - Authorization to allow the use of public property and right-of-way for the program.
As directed by mayor and city council, the public works director is authorized to allow the installation of stations and kiosks on public property including the public right-of-way. Such stations shall only be installed by a provider that has a contract with the city to manage and provide services to the public under the program. In order for the provider to install required infrastructure for operations of the program in the public right-of-way, the provider must enter into an encroachment agreement with the city for the installation of each kiosk and station. In no instance shall the contract or the authorization granted by this section require the public works director to allow the installation of kiosks and stations in locations which the public works director deems unsuitable for the installation of such infrastructure.

A notice shall be posted by the provider at the site on the street frontage where the station is to be located which states that the provider has sought permission from the city to install a station at the location.

The public works director shall receive any comments from the public and consider those comments in making a decision as to whether to authorize the station installation.

Submitted plans will either be: approved; denied; or recommended for resubmittal with modifications. The submitted design plans for stations located on private property must also comply with the same restrictions related to the location and placement of the stations installed in the public right-of-way as described immediately above in section 16-28.
