In the absence of any other disability pension from the city, a service-related disability pension in an amount equal to one hundred (100) per cent of the accrued benefit, having a minimum monthly payment of no less than two hundred dollars ($200.00), shall be paid to a disabled employee, without regard to age or length of service, who shall become totally and permanently disabled as the direct and proximate result of any of the following causes:

(2)
An occupational or industrial disease due to specific poisons, mechanical or chemical irritants and the like, which are recognized as a peculiar hazard of the occupation in the service of the city in which such person was engaged and of a character which other persons not so engaged do not contract; or

A disease or illness resulting immediately and exclusively from emergency exposure in the line of duty as an officer or employee of the city without the intervention of natural causes.
(c)
Nonservice-related disability. An employee who is not otherwise eligible for a disability pension, but who has been in the active service and on the payroll of the city for the immediately preceding ten (10) years and whose health during such period of service becomes totally and permanently impaired by reason of injury, ill health, age or infirmity, shall, as a matter of right, be entitled to retire and to receive from the pension fund, for the period that such employee's health continues to be totally and permanently impaired, a disability pension in an amount equal to one hundred (100) per cent of the accrued benefits. This disability pension shall be provided without regard to the age of the employee entitled thereto. In no event shall the monthly benefit payment be less than two hundred dollars ($200.00).
(d)
Double collection. Under no circumstances shall any employee be allowed to collect a disability pension while also collecting a normal service pension from the city.
(e)
Continuance of disability prerequisite to payments:
(1)
Investigation. Any disability pension except that resulting from the provisions of subsection (a), shall be paid only during the continuance of such employee's total disability. If the status of an employee's total disability comes into question, the pension board shall be authorized from time to time, but no more frequently than once every six (6) months, to investigate and inquire into the physical condition of the employee. If deemed necessary by the pension board, the employee shall be examined by a physician selected by the pension board for determination of the employee's disability status. An issue regarding continuance of disability and eligibility of the employee to receive a pension may be framed at the request of any member of the pension board or by any member of the governing body. Thereupon, the pension board shall proceed, after twenty (20) days' notice to the employee, to fully investigate and inquire into the question of continuance of disability.
(2)
Testimony, etc. The city and the employee shall have the right to present sworn and documentary testimony upon the question of the continuance of total disability and both parties shall have the means of compulsory process for the attendance of witnesses and the right to be represented by counsel. In the event that the judgment of the pension board should be that total disability has ceased, judgment shall be entered accordingly and the pension theretofore allowed shall immediately cease and no longer be payable to the employee. Said judgment shall be entered upon the minutes of the board and shall constitute a final judgment, which either the governing body or the employee may appeal by writ of certiorari as now provided by law.
(3)
Authority of the pension board. The authority of the pension board to enter a new judgment terminating a disability pension formerly allowed to a disabled employee must be exercised during the employee's lifetime. If such authority is not exercised during the employee's lifetime, the question of continuance of the employee's disability pension may never be raised.
(f)
Reports of injury in line of duty. Every employee shall be required, within thirty (30) days after an injury in the line of duty as an officer or employee of the city, to file with the clerk of the pension board, upon forms provided for such purpose, a written report of such injury, indicating the cause and extent of injury to the best of the employee's knowledge and belief. Said written report shall include all other pertinent information requested by the pension board or by the clerk. Notice of injury properly given to the city pursuant to the workers' compensation laws of the state shall meet the notice requirements of this subsection. The minutes of the pension board shall from month to month show the date of filing of each such report, the names of the persons filing such reports and a brief statement of the nature and cause of injury claimed. Written reports shall be preserved by the clerk as part of the permanent records of the pension board. Any employee so injured and failing without excuse to file such report shall be forever barred from basing a claim for a disability pension on the injury so received.
(g)
Medical and laboratory examination; reports. All employees and probationary employees injured in the line of duty shall stand such physical examination, including laboratory and X-ray examination, as the governing body or pension board may from time to time require.

To illustrate, if a person upon whose service a pension depends drew, during the last twelve (12) months that such employee received wages as an employee of the city, the sum of one hundred seventy dollars ($170.00) per month and during the preceding twelve (12) months the sum of one hundred forty dollars ($140.00) per month, the "average monthly salary or wage" of such employee would be the sum of one hundred fifty-five dollars ($155.00) per month. If the same employee during the last nine (9) months of employment by the city drew the sum of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00) per month and during the preceding fifteen (15) months the sum of one hundred eighty dollars ($180.00) per month, the average monthly salary or wage of such employee as used in this division would be the sum of one hundred ninety-six dollars and eighty-seven and one-half cents ($196.87½) per month.
(Code 1963, § 2-69)
Sec. 14-69. - Service pension.
Any such employee who has attained the age of sixty-five (65) with ten (10) years of service, or who has attained the age of fifty-five (55) and completed twenty-five (25) years of service on the payroll of the city, of which five (5) years or more must have been immediately preceding the right to have benefits under this division, shall be entitled to retire as a matter of right and to receive a service pension in an amount equal to one-half (½) the average monthly salary or wage as herein defined, paid to such employee, but not exceeding the sum of one thousand three hundred dollars ($1,300.00) per annum in any instance, which service pension shall be paid monthly during the remainder of the natural life of such employee, except that such pension shall cease immediately upon acceptance of such employee of other public employment of the nature defined by section 14-71. Pension benefits for an employee who has not attained the age of fifty-five (55) and completed twenty-five (25) years of service shall be computed on the same basis as provided for a partial pension for disability.
(Code 1963, § 2-70)
Sec. 14-70. - Service connected disability pensions.
A service connected disability pension in an amount equal to one-half (½) the average monthly salary or wage as herein defined, but not exceeding thirteen hundred dollars ($1,300.00) per annum in any instance, shall be paid to a disabled employee without regard to age or length of service, who shall become totally and permanently disabled as the direct and proximate result of any of the following causes:
(1)
Accident suffered in line of duty as an officer or employee of the city resulting immediately in total and permanent disability of such person;
(2)
An occupational or industrial disease due to specific poisons, mechanical or chemical irritants and the like, which are recognized as a peculiar hazard of the occupation in the service of the city in which such person was engaged and of a character which other persons not so engaged do not contract; or
(3)
From a disease or illness resulting immediately and exclusively from emergency exposure in the line of duty as an officer or employee of the city, without the intervention of natural causes.
(Code 1963, § 2-71)
Sec. 14-71. - Pension for disability.
(a)
Full pension. Any employee of the city who has been in the active service and on the payroll of the city for twenty-five (25) years or more, of which service five (5) years or more must have been immediately preceding the right to have benefits under this division and whose health during said period of service becomes totally and permanently impaired by reason of injury, ill health, age or infirmity, shall, as a matter of right, be entitled to retire and to receive from the pension fund hereby created a disability pension equal in amount to the normal retirement pension to which such employee would otherwise be entitled. The disability pension provided by this section shall be allowed without regard to the age of the employee entitled thereto.
(b)
Partial pension. Any employee of the city who is not entitled to a pension as described in subsection (a), but who has been in the active service and on the payroll of the city for ten (10) years or more of which service five (5) years or more must have been immediately preceding the right to have benefits under this division and whose health during said period of service becomes totally and permanently impaired by reason of injury, ill health, age or infirmity shall, as a matter of right, be entitled to retire and to receive from the pension fund hereby created for the period that such employee's health continues to be totally and permanently impaired, a disability pension in an amount proportionate to the total number of whole years of service to the city by such employees. The disability pension provided by this section shall be allowed without regard to the age of the employee entitled thereto. The amount of such disability pension shall be such proportionate part of the service pension allowed after twenty-five (25) years of service for an employee earning the same salary or wages that the number of whole years of service by such disabled employee bears to twenty-five (25) years. To illustrate, the amount of a disability pension based on an average monthly salary or wage of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175.00) after fifteen (15) years of service to the city would be fifteen-twenty-fifths of one-half of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175.00), or the sum of fifty-two dollars and fifty cents ($52.50) per month. The amount of a disability pension based on an average monthly salary or wage of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00) would after nineteen and one-half (19½) years of service be nineteen-twenty-fifths of one-half of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00) per month or the sum of eighty-five dollars and fifty cents ($85.50) per month. The amount of pension allowed for disability under this subsection shall never exceed the sum of thirteen hundred dollars ($1,300) per annum with respect to employees in the employ of the city prior to July, 1, 1965, who retain their status in the pension plan of the city as said plan existed to the year 1965.
(c)
Under no circumstances shall any employee of said city be allowed to collect a disability pension and a normal retirement pension.
(Code 1963, § 2-72)
Cross reference— For amendment to this section, see § 14-90(7).
Sec. 14-72. - Increase in amount of pension.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, every person now entitled to and receiving a pension hereunder and so entitled and so receiving the same on January 1, 1980, shall be entitled and so receiving an additional and extra fifty dollars ($50.00) per month. This section is to become effective January 1, 1981, and shall not apply to any person not entitled to and receiving a pension from the city as of January 1, 1980.
(Code 1963, § 2-73)
Sec. 14-73. - Continuance of disability prerequisite to payments.
(a)
Investigation. Any disability pension allowed to any city employee from any cause, that is either the service connected disability pension or the disability pension allowed after ten (10) years or more of service, except the disability pension allowed after twenty-five (25) years or more of service, shall be allowed and paid only during the continuance of such employee's total disability, except that such pension may be continued to the employee's qualified widow or qualified minor children in a reduced amount if the employee makes the additional contributions provided by section 14-79. If a question should arise at any time as to the continuance of total disability and the eligibility for that reason of the pensioner to continue to receive a pension, the pension board shall be authorized from time to time, but not oftener than once each six (6) months, to investigate and inquire into the physical condition of such pensioner and if it deems advisable to have such pensioner examined by a physician selected by the pension board for that purpose. An issue regarding continuance of disability and eligibility of the pensioner to receive a pension may be framed at the request of any member of the pension board or of any member of the governing body. Thereupon, the pension board shall proceed, after twenty (20) days' notice to the pensioner, to fully investigate and inquire into the question of continuance of disability.
(b)
Testimony. Both parties, that is, both the pensioner and the governing body shall have the right to present sworn and documentary testimony upon the question of the continuance of total disability and both parties shall have compulsory process for the attendance of witnesses and the right to be represented by counsel. In the event that the judgment of the pension board should be that total disability ceased during the pensioner's lifetime, judgment shall be entered accordingly and the pension theretofore allowed to the pensioner for total and permanent disability shall immediately cease and determine and shall no longer be payable either to the pensioner or the pensioner's beneficiary. The judgment of the pension board upon an issue of continuance of disability shall be entered upon the minutes of the board and shall constitute a final judgment which either the governing body or the pensioner may review by writ of certiorari as now provided by law.
(c)
Authority of board. The right of the pension board to enter a new judgment terminating a disability pension formerly allowed to a disabled employee must be exercised during the employee's lifetime. If such right is not exercised during the employee's lifetime and if such employee has made all contributions required by this division for benefits to such employee's widow or minor children, the question of continuance of the employee's disability pension to such employee's qualified widow or qualified minor child, at the reduced amount provided by this division, may never again be raised.

Sec. 14-74. - Reports of injury in line of duty.

Said written report shall include all other pertinent information requested by the board on its forms or by the clerk. The minutes of the pension board shall from month to month show the date of filing of each such report, the name of the person or persons filing same and a brief statement of the nature and cause of injury claimed. Written reports shall be preserved by the secretary as a part of the permanent records of the board. Any employee so injured and failing without excuse to file such report shall be forever barred from basing a claim for a pension on the injury so received.
(Code 1963, § 2-75)
Sec. 14-75. - Medical and laboratory examinations; reports.
All persons hereafter employed by the city, all probationary employees and all employees injured in line of duty shall stand such physical examination, including laboratory and X-ray examination, as the governing body may from time to time require. Such examinations shall be conducted by the persons designated by the governing body and written reports thereof shall be directed to the governing body, filed with the pension board and preserved as a part of the records of the board. Such reports shall be prima facie evidence in any future proceeding before the pension board of facts stated therein regarding the physical condition of such employees. The expense of examination of any person injured in the line of duty as a city employee shall be borne by the governing body. The expense of examination of other employees or prospective employees shall be borne in such manner as the governing body may from time to time require.

If such employee desires that such employee's widow or the employee's minor child or children succeed to the employee's rights as a pensioner, either upon employee's death after retirement on a pension or after the employee was eligible to retire, such employee may provide therefor by making the necessary designation of a beneficiary as herein provided and by paying within the time required by this division, in addition to the ordinary contribution of three (3) per cent of wages, an extra one per cent of such salary or wages, but not exceeding the sum of two dollars ($2.00) per month in any instance for widow's and children's benefits. If such additional deduction for benefits to widows and minor children is authorized, said extra one per cent of salary or wages shall be paid to the treasurer of the pension fund and credited to the pension account of such contributing employee.
(b)
Employer contributions. The governing body shall, beginning with the calendar year 1946 and annually thereafter, appropriate and pay into the pension fund created by this division an amount equal to the contributions thereto by all employees of the city during each calendar year, thereby matching dollar for dollar the contributions of all employees to said pension fund.

Fund management. Said pension fund shall be managed and invested by the pension board for the use and benefit of all employees of the city participating therein, and for the use and benefit of widows and dependent minor children of employees who have made for their protection the additional contribution of wages which is provided by this division. All investments of pension funds shall be authorized by the pension board. The board is specifically authorized to place funds held by it with banks or trust companies having corporate trust powers and authorized to do business in this state, and to authorize any such bank or trust company to invest and reinvest such funds for its account, subject to the provisions relating to investments by domestic insurance companies under the laws of the state. The board is further authorized to employ such banks and trust companies as agents for the keeping of records and the receipt and disbursement of funds held by or due the board.

The board is further authorized to purchase insurance contracts on the lives of participating employees and to purchase annuity contracts to provide retirement benefits to participating employees and pay all premiums thereon. The board is further authorized to employ such insurance companies to provide actuarial advice and to provide services in the keeping of records, and the receipt and disbursement of funds held by or due the board.

(Code 1963, § 2-79)
Sec. 14-79. - Beneficiaries; designation; contribution required; payment of pension.
(a)
Designation. In order to have the benefits of this section, an employee now on the payroll of the city (except a probationary employee) shall within thirty (30) days after approval of the ordinance from which this section is derived, and a person thereafter employed or a probationary employee shall within six (6) months after employment commences, file with the clerk of the pension board on forms provided for that purpose a request in writing that either the employee's spouse or minor child or children be recorded as beneficiary to receive benefits for which the employee agrees to make the additional contributions provided by this section. In addition to designation of beneficiary, such form shall state the names and ages of all members of the family of such employee. Beneficiary may be changed to the other class, that is, from spouse to children or from children to spouse, at any time. Such written requests shall be kept by the clerk as a part of the permanent records of the pension board.
(b)
Additional contributions. Thereafter, an additional one per cent of such employee's salary or wages shall be deducted each month and paid into the pension fund created hereby, except that such additional payment shall not exceed the sum of two dollars ($2.00) per month in any instance.
(c)
Rights of beneficiary. Except as herein provided, the last beneficiary so specified shall succeed to the rights of such employee as pensioner, upon such employee's death after retirement on pension, or being eligible to retire, except that the amount of pension paid to a beneficiary so designated shall be seventy-five (75) per cent of the amount of the pension that such employee was receiving, or entitled to receive, at the time of the employee's death.
(d)
Eligibility of beneficiary. A widow cannot receive a pension hereunder after she remarries, or unless she had been married to the employee upon whose service the pension depends at least five (5) years before such employee retired or became eligible for retirement. A minor child cannot receive a pension hereunder if more than eighteen (18) years of age, or after marriage. If there should in any case be more than one minor child unmarried and eighteen (18) years of age or under, then any pension payable to minor children hereunder shall be payable to and divided in equal shares between all minor children who, as it appears from the record filed with the pension board, are entitled to benefits under this division. Disbursement of pensions to minor children shall be made to their legally qualified guardian.
(e)
Nonexistence of qualified widow. If an employee specified his widow and there is no widow qualified to receive a pension under this division, but there are one or more minor children who would be qualified to receive a pension if they had been designated by the employee, such qualified minor children or their guardian may make application to the pension board and receive a pension as if designated by the employee to receive same. If a widow receives a pension hereunder and her right to continue to receive same terminates because of her death or remarriage, upon certification of the facts to the pension board such pension shall be continued without a new application to the minor child or children qualified to receive a pension under this division.
(f)
Nonexistence of qualified minor. If an employee specifies such employee's minor child or children and there is no minor child qualified to receive a pension under this division, but there is a widow who would be qualified if she had been designated by the employee, then such qualified widow may make application to the pension board and receive a pension as if designated by the employee to receive same. If a minor child or children receive a pension hereunder and the right to continue to receive same terminates because of the death or the marriage or attainment by all minor children of more than eighteen (18) years of age, upon certification of the facts to the pension board such pension shall be continued without a new application to the surviving widow qualified to receive benefits hereunder for the period of time that she remains unmarried.
(g)
Death of beneficiary. Upon death of either a minor child or widow, such person's estate shall be entitled to no benefits under this division. A pension payable to a widow under this division shall be payable for the term of her natural life or widowhood.
(Code 1963, § 2-80)
Cross reference— For amendment to this section, see § 14-90(6).
Sec. 14-80. - Death of pensioner.
Upon the death of any pensioner of any of the classes set forth in this division, such pensioner's pension shall cease and determine and shall not continue to be paid to such pensioner's heirs, executors or administrators, except as herein provided.
(Code 1963, § 2-81)
Sec. 14-81. - Probation period of six months required.
Notwithstanding any provision or clause of this division, no employee of the governing body shall be required to make any contribution to the pension fund established by this division and no pension rights shall accrue to such employee or such employee's widow or minor child for a period of six (6) months after the commencement of such employee's employment as an employee of the city. In the event such new employee continues in the service of the city after the six (6) month period, then the full amount of contributions required by this division of other employees making the same salary or wages during the same six (6) months shall be deducted from the employee's wages during the seventh month of employment and, together with all contributions required by this division during the seventh and succeeding months, shall be paid into the pension fund and credited to the account of such contributing employee. The amount of such deduction during the seventh month, where three (3) per cent with maximum of six dollars ($6.00) per month or four (4) per cent with maximum of eight dollars ($8.00) per month, shall depend upon whether such probationary employee made the election for benefits for widow and minor children within the six (6)-month period as required by this division.
Beginning with the seventh month of employment, but not before, such new employee and such employee's beneficiaries herein named shall acquire pension rights under this division. After such pension status is acquired, the period of service of such new employee for the purpose of measuring benefits under this division shall date from the beginning of the period of original employment by the city.
It is the intention of this section of this division to require in all cases a six-month probation period, during which time a new employee shall not contribute to, nor acquire rights under, the pension system hereby created for the city, but that after the termination of the probationary period such new employee shall acquire pension rights which, if such employee remains in the service of the city that length of time, shall date back to such employee's first employment on probation by the governing body.
(Code 1963, § 2-82)
Sec. 14-82. - Refunds, credit for prior service.
No refund of any portion of the contribution of an employee to the pension fund shall be made under any circumstances, either to a former employee, an employee leaving the service of the city, or the executor, administrator or heirs-at-law for a former employee, except that if an employee leaves the service of the city subsequent to February 1, 1959, after at least five (5) years' continuous service and desires to surrender all pension rights under this division, the employee shall, upon application therefor within ninety (90) days after leaving the service of the city, be entitled to a refund of three-fourths (¾) of the total contributions made by such employee, and except that if an employee is discharged by the governing body to enable a returning veteran to resume the position that such veteran formerly held with the city, then all contributions made by such displaced employee shall be refunded to such employee.
If a person so displaced should again become an employee of the city, credit on such employee's pension status for periods of service prior to displacement shall be obtained only on condition that such employee, within six (6) months from the time reemployment commences, repays into the pension fund the amount of contributions so refunded to such employee, together with three (3) per cent interest thereon from date of withdrawal to date of repayment into said fund.
(Code 1963, § 2-83)
Sec. 14-83. - Cessation of benefits.
If any employee of the city, after having been granted a pension hereunder, shall thereafter, become an officer, deputy or employee of this municipality, then in that event such employee's pension shall cease and such pensioner shall have no further rights or benefits under this article. This prohibition shall not apply to employees, who after being granted a pension, are elected to the positions of mayor and members of the city council.

DIVISION 4. - 1965 PENSION PLAN

Sec. 14-90. - Establishment and applicability of plan.
The pension benefits provided by this section and the several subsections of this section shall be in lieu of the pension benefits provided to employees under laws affording pension benefits to employees of the city in existence prior to the adoption of the enactment from which this section is derived, approved by the General Assembly during the year 1965.
(1)
Any officer or employee of the city who was so employed on the effective date of such enactment, and who is otherwise eligible for pension benefits under the act approved January 30, 1946 (Ga. L. 1946, pp. 432 through 454) and sections 14-66 through 14-83, may elect to come under the provisions of this section, and the several subsections hereof, in lieu of other pension benefits and obligations which the applicant might have been entitled to from the city under the pension plan of the city as same existed prior to the effective date of such enactment, to the extent that the provisions of this section are in conflict with prior acts establishing or amending the pension plan for employees of the city. All officers and employees employed by the city on the effective date of this section, who do not in writing elect to accept the benefits and obligations of this section, and the several subsections hereof, shall have the rights and obligations with respect to the employees pension plan of the city determined under the law as it existed prior to this section. Employees and officers of the city who become employed by the city after the effective date of the enactment from which this section is derived shall have their benefits and obligations with respect to the pension plan of the city determined with reference to and fixed by the provisions of said pension plan as amended by this section.
(2)
Any officer or employee of the city who elects to come under the provisions of this section, and the several subsections hereof, or who becomes employed by the city subsequent to the effective date of the enactment from which this section is derived and who retires as a matter of right and after reaching the age of fifty-five (55), shall be entitled to receive a service pension in an amount equal to two (2) per cent of the first three hundred dollars ($300.00) of such employee's average monthly salary, plus one and one-half (1½) per cent of such employee's average monthly salary over three hundred dollars ($300.00), multiplied by the number of years of service. For example, an employee who retires as a matter of right after twenty-five (25) years of service, whose monthly salary is five hundred dollars ($500.00), is entitled to a monthly pension in the amount of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00) determined as follows: Two (2) per cent of the first three hundred dollars ($300.00) of average monthly salary equals six dollars ($6.00). One and one-half (1½) per cent of the average monthly salary over three hundred dollars ($300.00), (which excess is two hundred dollars ($200.00) in this illustration), equals three dollars ($3.00). The sum of six dollars ($6.00) and three dollars ($3.00) thus obtained, or nine dollars ($9.00), is then multiplied by twenty-five (25), (the number of years of service), to arrive at the monthly pension of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00). Pensions benefits of that class of employees having retired under this section prior to July 1, 1979, shall be increased by the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per annum.
(3)
The sum of five (5) per cent of the salary or wages of officers and employees coming under the provisions of this section, and the subsections hereof, and who do not provide for the payment of a pension to a widow or minor child or children, shall be deducted from the salary or wages earned by such officers and employees during each calendar month. The sum of six (6) per cent of the salary or wages of officers and employees coming under the provisions of this section, and the subsections hereof, and who desire that the employee's widow or minor child or children succeed to the employee's rights as a pensioner (as authorized by sections 14-50 through 14-62) shall be deducted from the salary or wages earned by such officers and employees during each calendar month.
(4)
With respect to officers and employees in the service of the city on the date the enactment from which this section is derived became effective, and who elect to come under the provisions of this section, the sums required to be paid as deductions from salary or wages under this section, and the subsections hereof, shall be deducted from all sums paid such officers and employees as salary or wages subsequent to the date on which the officer or employee files with the pension board a written application to elect to come under the provisions of this section. With respect to persons coming into the service of the city after such effective date, an employee's contributions shall commence after such employee's probationary period (as described in section 14-66) has been served.
(5)
Any person in the service of the city on such effective date, who elects to come under the provisions of this section, and the subsections hereof, and who shall voluntarily retire within three (3) years immediately following such effective date, shall pay into the pension fund an amount which, when added to the amounts deducted by the city, will equal the total amount that would have been deducted during such three-year period had the person remained in the service of the city for the full three-year period at the salary or wages such employee was drawing at the time of such employee's retirement. Such payment shall be made within six (6) months after retirement. In case the required payment is not made within said six-month period, the pension board shall collect the amount by deductions from future pension payments, in such amounts as the board may fix, whether such payments are made to the employee or a surviving widow or children designated as beneficiary by the employee. Past due payments shall bear interest at six (6) per cent per annum. No payments shall be required in case of involuntary retirement, but shall be required in case of death of an employee, within three (3) years of the date of approval of this section, who has designated a widow or minor children as beneficiary to succeed to the employee's rights as a pensioner, where the widow or minor children designated are eligible for and actually receive pension payments.
(6)
There is hereby added to section 14-79, following the sentence ending with the word "widowhood" at the end of such section, the following provisions:
"Provided that if a widow of the pensioner receiving service pension benefits is more than five (5) years younger than the pensioner there shall be deducted from her pension one-twelfth of two (2) per cent per month for each month that she is more than five (5) years younger than the pensioner; provided, however, that said reduction of one-twelfth of two (2) per cent shall not apply if the widow is fifty-five (55) years or more of age at the time she becomes eligible for benefits.
"The words minor 'child' or 'children' shall mean the natural or legally adopted minor child or children of an employee who were in life or adopted prior to the pensioner's retirement from active service."
(7)
The following sentence contained in section 14-71, commencing in the eleventh line from the top of page 442 of said original act, is deleted in its entirety, to wit: "The amount of pension allowed for disability shall never exceed the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month in any instance." And the following is substituted in lieu thereof: "The amount of pension allowed for disability shall never exceed the sum of thirteen hundred dollars ($1,300.00) per annum with respect to employees in the employ of the city prior to July 1, 1965, who retain their status in the pension plan of the city as said plan existed prior to the year 1965."
(8)
There is hereby added to this division the following provisions: "If an employee who has contributed to the pension fund and who has at least five (5) years of continuous service should resign or be dismissed from the city without having received or become eligible to receive a pension of any kind (except an employee displaced by a returning veteran), such employee shall be entitled to receive a refund of seventy-five (75) per cent of the total contributions made by the employee to the pension fund, and the payment by the pension board of such refund to such employee shall terminate such employee's rights under this law. Such refund shall be paid within ninety (90) days of the employee's date of termination of service; and should such an employee die before receiving said refund, said refund shall be paid to such employee's estate. No employee who has resigned or been dismissed from service with the city and who has been paid a refund of a portion of such employee's contributions to the pension fund, and who is reemployed by the city, shall be entitled to receive credit on such employee's service record for prior year's service until all of the amount received as refund (together with three (3) per cent interest per annum thereon from the date of terminating employment to date of repayment of the refund) shall be repaid to the pension fund; and such repayment must be made by the employee during such employee's lifetime and while in the employ of the city.
"If an employee who has contributed to the fund should die without having received or become entitled to receive a pension of any kind under this law, and without leaving a qualified widow or minor child eligible to receive a pension of any kind under this law, the estate of such deceased employee shall be entitled to receive a refund of ninety-five (95) per cent of the total contributions made by the employee to the pension fund. No pension shall be paid under this division to any person except to a qualified employee or to the qualified widow or minor child or children of a qualified employee.
"If any employee is discharged from employment by the city for the purpose of enabling a returning veteran to resume the position formerly held by said veteran, all contributions to the pension fund made by such displaced employee shall be refunded to such employee."
(Code 1963, § 2-91)
Editor's note— Senate Bill No. 79, 1965, § 1 amended the pension Act originally included in the charter and presently codified as this article by enacting the provisions codified as § 14-90 above.

(a)

It is the intent of this provision that the city pay the entire sum required for the funding of the city employee pension fund.
(b)
Any refund or estate benefit which an employee or such employee's estate becomes eligible to receive under the law prior to enactment of this amendment shall be limited to the actual contributions paid by said employee prior to this amendment.
