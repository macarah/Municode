(Ord. No. 2018-11, § 1(Exh. A), 11-19-18)
Sec. 10-4. - Same—Filing to avoid charges; false statements.
Whoever makes application for any utility service in such person's own behalf, or on behalf of another, for the purpose of avoiding past due amounts and charges for previous service to the same or separate account; or whoever uses a false name in applying for such service or in any other manner attempts to obtain any such service through fraud or false pretense shall be guilty of an offense punishable in the City Court of College Park and said application shall be void.

(Ord. No. 2018-11, § 1(Exh. A), 11-19-18)

(a)
All electric, sanitation, water and sewer charges incurred by a person or entity for the provision of such utility services to one (1) property during a calendar month shall be listed on a single, monthly bill issued by the city.
(b)
Any bill issued by the city for the provision of any utility service shall be due and payable immediately upon issuance and shall be considered delinquent if not fully paid before 11:59 p.m. on the twenty-first (21 st ) day following the date of such bill; provided, however, that if such date falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday observed by the city, then such bill shall be due and payable by 11:59 p.m. on the following business day.
(c)
In the event the person or entity fully liable for all monetary obligations arising from the city's provision of a utility service to a property fails to fully pay any bill for the provision of such service before 11:59 p.m. on the twenty-first (21 st ) day following the date of such bill, a penalty in an amount determined by resolution of the mayor and council shall be automatically added to any outstanding, unpaid amount due under such bill.
(d)
In the event the person or entity fully liable for all monetary obligations arising from the city's provision of a utility service to a property fails to remit to the city monies for all amounts shown on the bill required by subsection (a) before 11:59 p.m. on the seventh (7 th ) calendar day after the past due date indicated on such bill, the city shall have the right, pursuant to section 10-13(b), to discontinue the utility service. In addition to the right to discontinue such service, the failure to remit to the city all amounts shown on such bill by 11:59 p.m. on the seventh (7 th ) calendar day after the past due date indicated on the utility service bill shall result in the imposition by the city of an administrative charge as determined by resolution of the mayor and council.

Said record shall also include any information as to whether any bill was returned to the city due to the inability of the mail carrier to deliver such item to the listed mailing address or any information indicating any other delivery issue.
(2)
Where the city's records show a bill was issued to the person or entity fully liable for all monetary obligations arising from the provision of the utility service at the current mailing address provided to the city by such person or entity and said records do not indicate the bill was returned by the mail carrier as undelivered or any other delivery issue, a rebuttable presumption arises that such bill was actually received by the person or entity fully liable for said monetary obligations within five (5) calendar days after the date the bill was issued.

(Ord. No. 2018-11, § 1(Exh. A), 11-19-18)
Sec. 10-10. - Liability for utility charges.
(a)
Any utility service furnished by the city may be instituted by the owner or occupant of premises where such service are available. Such owner or occupant shall be liable for payment of all rates and charges therefor.
(b)
All unpaid charges for sanitation services shall constitute a lien on the property to which such services were provided in accordance with section 6-10 of the City Charter, and such lien may be enforced and foreclosed in the same manner as liens for city property taxes.
(c)

Should the results of the check show the meter to be functioning accurately and in accordance with the city's standards, the deposit will be forfeited by the customer. Should the results of the check show the registration of the meter to be in error in excess of the city's standards or show the meter is registering more utility than actually is passing through that device, the city will refund the deposit to the customer.
(c)
Repair or replacement of meter. If the results of the meter test performed by the city under this section show the registration of the meter to be in error in excess of the city's standards or show the meter is registering more utility than actually is passing through the device, the city shall repair or replace the meter at no charge to the customer. The results of the meter test show the meter to be functioning accurately and the customer requests the replacement of that meter, the city shall replace the meter and shall charge the customer an administrative fee in an amount as determined by resolution of the mayor and council.

e.
Any other ground for which the administrator, in his/her discretion, determines that an adjustment is appropriate and that the grant of such adjustment would not violate any provision of this article or any other ordinance of the city.
(3)
The following conditions and restrictions shall apply to any administrative adjustment sought under subsection (a)(2)d.:
a.
No administrative adjustment may be granted for excessive water loss due solely to a faulty or malfunctioning faucet, spigot or toilet.
b.
To be eligible for such adjustment, the requestor must submit to the administrator documentation or other evidence establishing that the faulty water heater, the faulty meter or the water pipe leak that caused the excessive water loss has been repaired.
c.
In determining the monetary amount of any administrative adjustment, the administrator may not consider account information or charges on any account statement that was issued by the city more than six (6) months before the date of the bill in issue.
(4)
Individual financial hardship. In the case of individual financial hardship, the requestor may obtain an administrative adjustment that extends (for a maximum of six (6) months) the period in which the requestor may have to remit to the city the full amount due under a utility service account. The administrator may grant an administrative adjustment due to a requestor's individual financial hardship under the following terms:

c.
A requestor may obtain only one (1) administrative adjustment due to an individual financial hardship in any twelve-month period.
(5)
Medical condition. Where any resident of the property has a medical condition that requires the provision of the utility service and additional time is needed to fully pay all amounts due on the account for such service, the requestor may obtain an administrative adjustment that extends (for a maximum of six (6) months) the period in which the requestor may remit to the city the full amount due under a utility service account. The administrator may grant an administrative adjustment due to such medical condition under the following terms:
a.
The requestor can obtain only an extension of the time in which to pay and cannot obtain a reduction of any charge (other than penalties assessed under section 10-5(c)).

Extension of due date based on a request for an administrative adjustment.
(1)

Notwithstanding a pending written adjustment request, the failure to timely remit full payment for all charges and assessments shown on a bill shall be grounds for the involuntary discontinuance of utility service under section 10-13(b). The administrator has the discretion to waive the requirements of this subsection and to set a new due date for the full payment.
(2)
Where the written request for an administrative adjustment is sought under subsection (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section, the due date for the full payment of all charges and assessments for the adjustment is sought shall be automatically extended until seven (7) days after the date the administrator's decision on the request.
