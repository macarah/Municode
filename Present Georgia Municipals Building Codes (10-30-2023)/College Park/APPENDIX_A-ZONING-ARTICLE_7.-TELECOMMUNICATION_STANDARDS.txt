ARTICLE 7. - TELECOMMUNICATION STANDARDS

7.1 - Purpose.
The purpose of this Article is to establish guidelines and regulations for the siting of all wireless, cellular, television, and radio telecommunications facilities, including all equipment and network components, exclusive of any underlying support structure, such as antennas, transmitters, receivers, base stations, power supplies, cabling, accessory equipment, or other mechanisms used to provide and or aid the transmission of wireless data, cellular, television, radio, or other telecommunications services. The Mayor and Council recognize that the city is to provide for the siting of telecommunication facilities, support structures, and antennas pursuant to the mandates of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. While mandated to make such provisions, the Mayor and Council also recognize that telecommunications facilities, such as towers and monopoles, telecommunication support structures, and antennas may negatively impact the aesthetic appearance of the city, and may reduce the property value of lots proximately located to such telecommunication support structures, particularly when they are sited adjacent to residential areas.
The goals of this Article, therefore, are:
1.
To encourage the location of telecommunications facilities, including all Telecommunication Support Structures, Equipment, and/or Antenna(s) in nonresidential areas;
2.
To promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by regulating the sitting of and establishing development standards for wireless facilities and related wireless support structures, equipment, and infrastructure;
3.
To minimize the total number of telecommunication support structures within the community necessary to provide adequate personal wireless services to residents of College Park;
4.
To encourage the joint use of new and existing telecommunication support structure sites among service providers;
5.
To locate telecommunication facilities and antennas in areas where adverse impacts on the community are minimized;
6.
To encourage the design and construction of telecommunication facilities and antennas in a manner that minimizes adverse visual impacts;
7.
To follow and promote policies embodied in Section 704 of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and O.C.G.A. § 36-66B-1, et al., in such a manner as not to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent wireless services or to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless services in the city;
8.
To encourage the location of telecommunication support structures on municipal property; and
9.
To enhance the ability of the providers of wireless telecommunications services to deliver such services to the community effectively, efficiently and safely.

If the City requires any widening, repair, reconstruction, or relocation of a public road or highway, or relocation of poles, support structures, or small cell installations as a result of a public project, the telecommunication facility owner shall relocate poles and support structures that have been installed in the right-of-way at no cost to the City in case said poles and support structures are found to unreasonably interfere with the widening, repair, reconstruction or relocation project or the public project. The telecommunication facility owner shall relocate the poles or support structures:
a.
By the date designated in a written notice by the City that contains a good faith estimate of the date by which the City intends to commence work so long as the time frames are applied to all utilities in the right-of-way, provided, however, that the date designated for relocation shall be at least forty-five (45) days after the City provides written notice of same; or
b.
Within the time frame that the telecommunication facility owner estimates in good faith is reasonably needed to complete the relocation, so long as such good faith estimate is provided to the City in writing within thirty (30) days following receipt of the City's written notice and explains in detail why such relocation cannot be reasonably completed by the date designated by the City.
2.
The telecommunication facilities owner shall reasonably cooperate with the City to carry out reconditioning work activities for any poles or decorative poles owned by the City in a manner that minimizes interference with the approved use of the facility. The City shall use reasonable effort to provide the telecommunication facility owner with written notice of reconditioning work at least one hundred twenty (120) days before such work begins. Upon receiving such notice, it shall be the telecommunication facility owner's sole responsibility to provide adequate measures to cover, remove, or otherwise protect the facility from the consequences of the reconditioning work including, but not limited to, paint and debris fallout. The City reserves the right to require removal of all facilities from the City's pole and surrounding premises during reconditioning work, provided that the requirement to remove such is contained in the written notice required herein. All costs associated with the protection measures shall be the sole responsibility of the telecommunication facility owner.
3.
In the case of the City needing to replace its poles or decorative poles, the City shall provide the telecommunication facility owner with at least one hundred twenty (120) days written notice of same before the City may remove the facility. The City shall promptly notify the telecommunication facility owner when the poles have been replaced and the equipment can be reinstalled. During the replacement work, the telecommunication facility owner may maintain a temporary communications facility on the property, or, after approval by the City, on any land owned or controlled by the City in the vicinity of the property.
4.
If the telecommunication facility owner fails to relocate a support structure as required in this section, or fails to provide a good faith estimate of the time needed to relocate, the City shall have the right, ten (10) days after written notice of same, to cut power or move any support structure or pole located in the right-of-way as the City may determine to be necessary, appropriate, or useful in order to commence work on the public project.
L.
Abandonment; Removal of Facilities.
1.
A small cell installation that is not operated, or a support structure or pole that is not utilized, for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner shall remove such within ninety (90) days after receipt of a written notice from the City notifying the owner of the abandonment. The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail at the last known address of the owner. Unless the owner provides written notice that the facility is not abandoned or does not remove same within said ninety (90) days, the City shall remove the facility, support structure or pole through actions provided for nuisance abatement under this Code.
2.
If an owner decides to abandon any small cell installation, support structure or pole, the owner shall notify the City no later than thirty (30) days after abandonment. The owner shall then remove the facility no later than 90 days after said notice. Failure to remove the facility, pole or support structure shall authorize the City to do so at the owner's expense. The owner shall be responsible for an additional penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00). Until the owner pays said expense and penalty, the owner shall not be entitled to apply for, or receive, any future permits under this section.
M.
Public Safety.
1.
An Applicant in the public right-of-way shall employ due care during the installation and maintenance process and shall comply with all safety and public right-of-way protection requirements in the City codes and regulations and State Law.
2.
An Applicant or permittee pursuant to this section shall not place any small cell installations, support structures, poles or decorative poles where they will interfere with any existing infrastructure or equipment and shall locate its lines and equipment in such a manner as not to interfere unnecessarily with the usual vehicular or pedestrian traffic patterns or with the rights or reasonable convenience of owners of property that abuts any public right-of-way.
3.
If the City determines that a telecommunication facility owner's activity in the public right-of-way pursuant to this section creates an imminent risk to public safety, the City shall provide written notice to the facility owner requiring the facility owner to address said risk. If the facility owner fails to address the issue within 24 hours of the written notice, the City shall be authorized to address said issue at the facility owner's expense.
4.
Any damage to the public right-of-way caused by the activities of the telecommunication facility owner while occupying, installing, repairing or maintaining small cell installations, poles, or support structures shall be repaired promptly by the facility owner. If the facility owner fails to conduct such repairs within ninety (90) days of receipt of a written notice from the City notifying the facility owner of the damage to the right-of-way, the City shall be authorized to correct and repair the damage at the facility owner's expense, plus a five hundred dollars ($500.00) penalty. Failure of the facility owner to pay the City's expenses under those circumstances, as well as the penalty, shall result in the facility owner being prohibited from applying for, or receiving, any further permits under this section until the full amount is paid to the City.
N.
Alternate Locations. For application for new poles in the public right-of-way in areas zoned for residential use, the City may propose an alternate location in the public right-of-way within one hundred (100) feet of the location set forth in the application, and the Applicant shall use the City's proposed alternate location unless the location imposes technical limits or significant additional costs, a fact the Applicant must certify to have determined in good faith, based on the assessment of a licensed engineer, and shall provide a written summary of the basis for such determination.
O.
First Come, First Served Requests. If multiple applications are received by the City to install two or more poles or decorative poles at the same location or to co-locate two (2) or more small cell installations on the same pole, decorative pole or support structure, the Applications shall be considered in the order they were received once deemed complete and, if a permit is granted for the first completed application, the subsequent completed applications for the same location shall be deemed to be automatically denied.
