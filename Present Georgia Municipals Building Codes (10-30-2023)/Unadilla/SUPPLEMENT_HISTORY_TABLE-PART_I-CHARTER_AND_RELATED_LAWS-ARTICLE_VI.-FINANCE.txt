ARTICLE VI. - FINANCE

Section 6.10. - Property tax.
The Council may assess, levy and collect an ad valorem tax on all real and personal property within the corporate limits of the City that is subject to such taxation by the State and County. This tax is for the purpose of raising revenues to defray the costs of operating the City government; providing governmental services; for the repayment of principal and interest on general obligations; and for any other public purposes as determined by the Council in its discretion. The City is hereby exempted from the provisions of Georgia Code sections 92-4101 through 92-4104, inclusive.
Section 6.11. - Millage rate, due dates, payment methods.
The Council, by ordinance, shall establish a millage rate for the City property tax; a due date; and in what length of time these taxes must be paid. The Council, by ordinance, may provide for the payment of these taxes by installments or in one lump sum, as well as to authorize the voluntary payment of taxes prior to the time when due. The tax rate set by such ordinance shall be such that reasonable estimates of revenues from such levy shall at least be sufficient, together with other anticipated revenues, fund balances and applicable reserves, to equal the total amount approximated for each of the several funds set forth in the annual operating budget for defraying the expenses of the general government of the City.
Section 6.12. - Occupation and business taxes.
The Council, by ordinance, shall have the power to levy such occupation or business taxes as are not denied by general State law. Such taxes may be levied on both individuals and corporations who transact business in the City or who practice or offer to practice any profession or calling therein to the extent such persons have a constitutionally sufficient nexus to the City to be so taxed. The Council may classify businesses, occupations, professions or callings for the purpose of such taxation in any way which may be lawful and compel the payment of such taxes as provided in this Article.
Section 6.13. - License, permits, fees.
The Council, by ordinance, shall have the power to require any individuals or corporations who transact business in this City or who practice or offer to practice any profession or calling therein to obtain a license or permit for such activity from the City and pay a reasonable fee for such license or permit where such activities are not now regulated by general State law in such a way as to preclude City regulation. Such fees may reflect the total cost to the City of regulating the activity and if unpaid shall be collected as provided in this Article for delinquent taxes and fees. The Council, by ordinance, may establish reasonable requirements for obtaining or keeping such licenses as the public health, safety and welfare necessitates.
Section 6.14. - Service charges.
The Council, by ordinance, shall have the power to assess and collect fees, charges and tolls for sewer, sanitary, health services or any other services rendered within and without the corporate limits of the City for the total cost to the City of providing such services. If unpaid, such charges shall be collected as provided in this Article for delinquent taxes and fees.
Section 6.15. - Special assessments.
The Council shall have power and authority to assess all or part of the cost of constructing, reconstructing, widening or improving any public way, street, sidewalk, curbing, gutters, sewers or other utility mains and appurtenances, from the abutting property owners, under such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by ordinance. Such special assessments shall become delinquent thirty days after their due dates, shall thereupon be subject, in addition to fi. fa. charges, to a penalty of ten percent, and shall thereafter be subject to interest at the rate of seven percent per annum from date due until paid. A lien shall exist against the abutting property superior to all other liens except that it shall be of equal dignity with liens for County and City property taxes. Said lien shall also be enforceable by the same procedures and under the same remedies as provided for in this Article for City property taxes.
Section 6.16. - Construction, other taxes.
The City shall be empowered to levy any other tax allowed now or hereafter by State law and the specific mention of any right, power or authority in this Article shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers of the City to govern its local affairs.
Section 6.17. - Collection of delinquent taxes and fees.
The Council, by ordinance, may provide generally for the collection of delinquent taxes, fees or other revenue due the City by whatever reasonable means as are not precluded by general State law. This shall include providing for the dates when the taxes or fees are due; late penalties or interest; issuance and execution of fi. fas.; creation and priority of liens; making delinquent taxes and fees personal debts of the persons required to pay the taxes or fees imposed; revoking City licenses for failure to pay any City taxes or fees; allowing exceptions for hardship; and providing for the assignment or transfer of tax executions.
Section 6.18. - Transfer of executions.
The City Clerk shall be authorized to assign or transfer any fi. fa. or execution issued for any tax or for any street, sewer or other assessment in the same manner and to the same extent as provided by Georgia law regarding sales and transfers of tax fi. fas. Such transfer or assignment, when made, shall vest the purchaser or transferee with all right, title and interest as provided by Georgia law governing sales and transfers of tax fi. fas.; provided, however, that upon levy of execution and sale of property pursuant to such tax fi. fa., whether assigned, transferred or executed by the City, the owner of such property, in fee simple or lesser interest shall not lose his right to redeem the property in accordance with the requirements of redemption of property sold under State or County ad valorem tax fi. fas. as said requirements now exist or as may be hereinafter provided by law.
Section 6.19. - General obligation bonds.
The Council shall have the power to issue bonds for the purpose of raising revenue to carry out any project, program or venture authorized under this charter or the general laws of the State. Such bonding authority shall be exercised in accordance with the laws governing bond issuances by municipalities in effect at the time said issue is undertaken.
Section 6.20. - Revenue bonds.
Revenue bonds may be issued by the Council as provided by an Act of the General Assembly of Georgia, approved March 31, 1937, known as the Revenue Bond Law (Ga. L. 1937, p. 761), as now or hereafter amended, or by any other Georgia law as now or hereafter provided.

Section 6.25. - Capital improvements budget.
(a)
The Mayor may submit to the Council a proposed capital improvements budget with his recommendations as to the means of financing the improvements proposed for the ensuing fiscal year. The Council shall have power to accept with or without amendments or reject the proposed program and proposed means of financing. The Council shall not authorize an expenditure for the construction of any building, structure, work or improvement unless the appropriations for such project are included in the capital improvements budget, except to meet a public emergency threatening the lives, health or property of the inhabitants, provided that such authorization is passed by two-thirds vote of the membership of the Council.
(b)
No appropriation provided for in the capital improvements budget shall lapse until the purpose for which the appropriation was made shall have been accomplished or abandoned, provided, however, that the Mayor may submit amendments to the capital improvements budget, accompanied by his recommendations thereon, at any time during the fiscal year. Any such amendments to the capital improvements budget shall become effective only upon adoption by a vote of the Council.

There shall be an annual independent audit of all City accounts, funds and financial transactions by a Certified Public Accountant selected by the Council.

(b)
The Council may quitclaim any rights it may have in property not needed for public purposes upon report by the Mayor and adoption of a resolution, both finding that the property is not needed for public or other purposes and that the interest of the City has no readily ascertainable monetary value.
(c)
Whenever in opening, extending or widening any street, avenue, alley or public place of the City, a small parcel or tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the City, the Council may authorize the Mayor to execute and deliver in the name of the City a deed conveying said cut-off or separated parcel or tract of land to an abutting or adjoining property owner or owners in exchange for rights-of-way of said street, avenue, alley or public place or in settlement of any alleged damages sustained by said abutting or adjoining property owner. All deeds and conveyances heretofore and hereafter so executed and delivered shall convey all title and interest the City has in such property, notwithstanding the fact that no public sale after advertisement was or is hereafter made.
