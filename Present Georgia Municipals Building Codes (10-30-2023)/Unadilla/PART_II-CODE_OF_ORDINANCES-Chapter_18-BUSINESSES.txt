Sec. 18-90. - Introduction.
Based on the experiences of other municipalities and counties, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas, Indianapolis, Indiana, Kennedale, Texas, the deposition of Steven M. Youngelson, professor of social ecology at the University of California, Irvine taken March 13, 1999 in the case of Artistic Entertainment v. City of Warner Robins, 223 F3D 1306(2000) and the deposition of James W. Meeker, faculty associate professor in the School of Social Ecology at the University of California, Irvin also taken on March 13, 1999 in the Artistic Entertainment case and on the wisdom and common sense of the mayor and council of the City of Unadilla, the mayor and council take note of the well-known and self-evidence conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country.
It is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, other adult businesses have the same deleterious effects on the community.
Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and other adult businesses are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and other adult businesses are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described. The mayor and council finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city as well.
The mayor and council therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and playgrounds to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult business establishments. Therefore, the mayor and council finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult business establishment. The mayor and council finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.
