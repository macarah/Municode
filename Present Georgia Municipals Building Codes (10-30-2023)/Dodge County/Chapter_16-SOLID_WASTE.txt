DIVISION 4. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS PROTECTION REGULATIONS

Sec. 16-205. - Findings of fact.
Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste, like septic tank affluent, contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
(Ord. of unknown date(4), § 7(a))
Sec. 16-206. - Reference map.
The official map for delineation of significant groundwater recharge areas in the county to be regulated areas under this article is the state department of natural resources' Significant Recharge Areas, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 edition).

Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements.
(2)
All new single-family dwellings, multifamily dwellings, mobile home parks, or other uses located within a groundwater recharge area and not served by both public water and sewer systems shall be required to have a minimum lot or space size at least 150 percent of normal requirements of the state department of human resources according to its Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems for the particular location and soil characteristics involved, but said minimum lot or space size shall not be in any case less than the minimum lot or space size specified by any underlying zoning district. The regulations specifying the largest minimum lot or space size shall apply.
(3)
All lots shall have a minimum width of 150 feet, or as specified in any underlying zoning district if stricter (larger), in the area where an approved on-site sewage management system is to be located.
(4)
All new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner except for the construction of mining settling basins.
(5)
All new agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compact clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 107 cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service.

DIVISION 5. - MAJOR RIVER CORRIDOR PROTECTION DISTRICT REGULATIONS

Sec. 16-229. - Findings of fact.
Perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second are of vital importance to the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable for habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. These river corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters.
(Ord. of unknown date(4), § 8(a))
Sec. 16-230. - District delineation.
Protected rivers, as defined under the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, adopted by the state department of natural resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, includes any perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second. The Ocmulgee River through the county meets these criteria. A protective 100-foot vegetation buffer is hereby established along this river. The buffer area is measured horizontally from each river bank within the county jurisdiction. Under the method prescribed by the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, no development or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within a 100-foot buffer of the river bank except for the permitted uses in section 16-231.
(Ord. of unknown date(4), § 8(b))
Sec. 16-231. - Permitted uses.
No development, or construction, or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the 100-foot buffer from the protected river except for the following uses, and the natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land disturbing activity or construction permitted within the river corridor for these acceptable uses:
(1)
Single-family dwellings, if any underlying zoning district so permits, provided each dwelling is located on a lot with a minimum size as specified by the county health department or the underlying zoning district regulations, but shall be the greater of these requirements; however, in any case, the lot for each dwelling shall not be less than two acres, not including any area between the river banks; and provided the septic tank drain field is located outside of the 100-foot buffer area.
(2)
Any industrial or commercial uses existing prior to the adoption of these local protection ordinances, providing they do not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended, and meet all other federal and state environmental regulations.
(3)
Road and utility crossings, providing the construction of these crossings meets the requirements of the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended, or any local requirements, if stricter.
(4)
