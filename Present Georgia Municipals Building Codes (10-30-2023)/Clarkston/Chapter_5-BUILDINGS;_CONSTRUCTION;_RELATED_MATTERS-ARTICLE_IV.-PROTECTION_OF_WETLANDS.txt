ARTICLE IV. - PROTECTION OF WETLANDS

Sec. 5-200. - Purpose.
(a)
The wetlands in the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the State of Georgia.
(b)
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
(c)
The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.
(Ord. No. 243, § 1, 10-3-00)
Sec. 5-201. - Definitions.
[As used in this article, the following terms shall have the respective meaning ascribed to them:]
Generalized wetlands map: The current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for the City of Clarkston, Georgia.
Jurisdictional wetland: An area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination: A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, as amended.
Regulated activity: An activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.
(Ord. No. 243, § 1, 10-3-00)
Sec. 5-202. - Establishment of the wetlands protection district.
(a)
The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the City of Clarkston, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
(b)
The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of the jurisdictional wetlands within the City of Clarkston, Georgia and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal, state or county permitting requirements.
(Ord. No. 243, § 1, 10-3-00)
Sec. 5-203. - Protection criteria.
Requirement for local permit or permission: No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is located within fifty (50) feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the city clerk using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
(Ord. No. 243, § 1, 10-3-00)
Sec. 5-204. - Permitted uses.
The following uses shall be allowed as of [a] right within the wetlands protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein.
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.

(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

Sec. 5-206. - Administration and enforcement procedures.
(a)
Upon receiving an application for a building permit or a development permit, the city clerk shall determine whether the area covered by the permit is in a wetlands protection district of the city as defined herein, or within fifty (50) feet of such a district. If the city clerk determines that the area covered by the requested permit is not within a wetlands protection district, or within fifty (50) feet of such a district, the clerk shall so note upon the application and no further action shall be required hereunder. If the city clerk determines that such area is within a wetlands protection district of the city, or within fifty (50) feet of such a district, the clerk shall not approve the permit and shall immediately notify the applicant of such determination and the requirement under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act that a determination must be obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as to whether the area to be developed lies within an area containing wetlands. No city permit for building or development shall be issued until such time as the applicant obtains and presents to the city clerk one of the following:
(1)
A written determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that no wetlands are on the area to be developed;
(2)
A Section 404 Permit; or
(3)
A letter of permission from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers allowing development on the wetland area.
(b)
Should the code enforcement officer of the city find that unpermitted activity is taking place on areas which he knows or reasonably believes are wetlands, he shall immediately contact the appropriate officials of DeKalb County who conduct building and/or development inspections requesting that they inspect and issue a stop work order, if appropriate, and shall also immediately notify the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
