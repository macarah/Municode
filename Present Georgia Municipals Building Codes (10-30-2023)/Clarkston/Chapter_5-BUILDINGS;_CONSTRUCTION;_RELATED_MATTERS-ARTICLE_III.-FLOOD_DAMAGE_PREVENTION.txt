(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(5)
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and
(6)
Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include this improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 5-133. - Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments.
An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of section 5-153 apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the city prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include:
(1)
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
(2)
Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the city. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles;
(3)
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one (1) every one hundred (100) feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development;

(Ord. No. 338, § 1(Attach. § 4.4), 9-1-09)
Sec. 5-134. - Floodway encroachments.
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood water, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased floodheights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (2) below;
(2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and
(3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the city.
(Ord. No. 338, § 1(Attach. § 4.5), 9-1-09)
Sec. 5-135. - Maintenance requirements.

(5)
Elevated buildings. All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished and flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
a.
Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
1.
Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
2.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and
3.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions.
b.
So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished and flood-resistant enclosure shall solely be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and
c.
The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
(6)
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located three (3) feet above the base flood elevation or one (1) foot above the future-conditions flood elevation, whichever is higher, so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;
(7)

DIVISION 5. - VARIANCES

Sec. 5-160. - Variance procedures.
The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this article. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the city, or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above.
(1)
Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be submitted to the city. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(2)
Any person adversely affected by any decision of the city shall have the right to appeal such decision to the mayor and city council as established by the city in accordance with procedures to be published by the city. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(3)
Any persons aggrieved by the decision of the City of Clarkston may appeal such decision to the DeKalb County Superior Court as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
(4)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(5)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(6)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(7)
In reviewing such requests, the city and the mayor and city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(8)
Conditions for variances:
a.
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
1.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
2.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
3.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
b.
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief, and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
c.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
d.
The director of public works shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(9)
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the city and the mayor and city council shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.
(10)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city and the mayor and city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this article.
(11)
Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."
