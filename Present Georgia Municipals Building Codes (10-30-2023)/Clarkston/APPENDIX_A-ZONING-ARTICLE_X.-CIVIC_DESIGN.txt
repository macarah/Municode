The purpose of these criteria is to create standards for outdoor lighting which will provide nighttime safety, security and utility, while reducing light pollution and light trespass, and increase conservation of energy.
(2)
Any lighting used to illuminate parking areas, access drives or loading areas shall be of such a design or level of illumination so as to minimize the amount of ambient lighting perceptible from adjacent properties and that would impair the vision of motorists.
(3)
The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) Lighting Handbook, Ninth Edition, shall be used as a guide for lighting installations. The definitions in this handbook shall be used for technical terminology.
(b)
Lighting standards.
(1)
Entrances into developments from a street may be lighted for traffic safety reasons provided such lighting does not exceed the foot candle requirements for lighting walkways and streets.
(2)
Lighting poles mounted on private property within fifty (50) feet from the street right-of-way may not exceed a height of sixteen (16) feet.
(3)
Accent lighting for building facades and other vertical structures shall be directed solely onto the building or structure and not toward the sky or onto adjacent properties. Direct light emissions shall not be visible above the roofline or beyond the building's edge. Shielding shall be provided to restrict light to the object being accented.

Lighting for uses adjacent to residentially zoned property shall be designed and maintained such that illumination levels do not exceed 1.0 foot-candles along property lines. Lighting for uses adjacent to non-residentially zoned property shall be designed and maintained such that illumination levels do not exceed 3.0 foot-candles along property lines.

All lighting fixtures designed or placed so as to illuminate any portion of a site shall meet the following requirements:
a.
Fixtures.
i.
Any wall or pole-mounted light fixture shall be a cutoff luminaire whose source is completely concealed with an opaque housing and shall not be visible from any street. The light output of the fixture shall be 2.5 percent or less of the total output at ninety (90) degrees from the vertical plane and ten percent or less of total output at eighty (80) degrees from the vertical plane.
ii.
Light fixtures for canopies covering fueling stations and at individual drive-through facilities shall be mounted such that the lens cover is recessed or flush with the bottom surface of the canopy and/or shielded by the fixture or the edge of the canopy. The light output of the fixture shall be 2.5 percent or less of the total output at 90 degrees from the vertical plane and ten (10) percent or less of total output at eighty (80) degrees from the vertical plane.
b.
Lamps. For parking lot and site lighting, the same type of lamp must be used for the same or similar type of lighting on any one site or development. All exterior luminaires that operate at greater than one hundred (100) watts shall contain lamps having a minimum efficacy of sixty (60) lumens/watt unless the luminaire is controlled by a motion sensor.
i.
Illumination levels. All site lighting shall be designed so that the level of illumination as measured in foot-candles (fc) at any one point meets the following standards. Minimum and maximum levels are measured at any one point. Average level is not to exceed the specified limit by more than twenty (20) percent, and is derived using only the area of the site included to receive illumination. Points of measure shall not include the area of the building or areas which do not lend themselves to pedestrian traffic. Also, if the major portion of the lighting design is to be in the front of a building, the average level should not be affected by additional lighting in the back of the same building, which would raise the average of the intended area for lighting. Illumination levels are as follows:
EXPAND
Location or Type of Lighting Minimum Level (fc) Average Level (fc) Maximum Level (fc)
Advertising Sign N/A N/A 20.0
Walkways and Streets 0.6 1.0 10.0

Maximum illumination readings must be taken directly beneath the luminaire. Vertical illumination readings shall be taken on the surface of the object being lighted or at five (5) feet above the ground for pedestrian areas.

a.
Location and mounting information for each light.
b.
Illumination calculations showing light levels in foot candles at points located on a ten-foot or smaller grid, including an illustration of the areas masked out per the requirements above regarding points of measurement.
