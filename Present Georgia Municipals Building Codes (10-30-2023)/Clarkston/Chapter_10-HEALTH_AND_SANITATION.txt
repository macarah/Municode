Abandonment, abandoned animal means the intentional or complete forsaking of any domesticated animal by its custodian, without making reasonable arrangements for the adequate care and custody of the animal to be assumed by another person or the failure to return and resume responsibility of an animal at the designated time as arranged with the care giver. Abandonment also means the act of placing a domesticated animal on public property or within a public building, unattended or uncared for, or on or within the private property of another without the express permission of the custodian, custodian, or tenant of the private property. A domesticated animal shall also be considered abandoned when it has been unattended and without adequate and proper food and water for a period more than thirty-six (36) hours, regardless of where such animal may be found or kept.
Abused animal means any animal which is mistreated, beaten, tormented or teased, or is deprived of water, food or shelter, or is kept under unsanitary conditions, or is abandoned, or is trained for fighting other animals.
Adequate care means exhibiting attention to the needs of an animal, including but not limited to, the provision of food, water, shelter, sanitary, safe, and healthy conditions, and adequate and timely veterinary medical attention necessary to maintain good health for the specific age, size, species, and breed of animal or to prevent suffering.
Adequate food means sufficient quantity of non-contaminated and nutritionally healthy sustenance that is appropriate to the species, breed, size, age and health of the animal, or at the direction of a licensed veterinarian; which is sufficient to prevent starvation, malnutrition, or risk to the animal's health. Garbage, spoiled, rancid, or contaminated food is not adequate food.
Adequate shelter means a protective covering for a domestic animal that provides adequate space and protection to maintain the animal in a state of good health, and that prevents pain, suffering, or significant risk to the animal's health. Adequate shelter shall consist of a completely enclosed structure with four (4) sides, a constructed floor, and a roof with a door opening. It should also be clean, dry, and compatible with current weather conditions, in addition to age, size, species and condition of the animal. The structure should be of sufficient size to allow the animal to stand, turn around, lie down, and go in and out of the structure comfortably. To be adequate, some type of bedding that is quick drying, such as hay or pine straw, must be provided to maintain comfortable temperatures within the structure during times when the ambient, outside temperature is below thirty-two (32) degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, the structure shall include a heavy plastic or rubber flap to cover the door and/or window openings during the months of December through March or when the ambient, outside temperature is below thirty-two (32) degrees Fahrenheit. From April through November, the structure shall either be shaded or moved out of direct sunlight. If the shelter is made of wood, it shall be raised at least two (2) inches off the ground to prevent seepage or rotting. Examples of inadequate shelter include, but are not limited to, lean-tos, metal or plastic drums, boxes, abandoned vehicles, porches, decks, or material that does not provide sufficient protection from the elements.
