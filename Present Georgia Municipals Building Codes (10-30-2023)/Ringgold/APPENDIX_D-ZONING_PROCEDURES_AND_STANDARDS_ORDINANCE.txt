Whether the extent to which the destruction or diminishing of the value of the lot or parcel proposed for zoning amendment promotes the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public.
d)
Whether the property to be affected by the proposed amendment can be used as currently zoned considering the suitability of the subject lot or parcel for the proposed zoned purposes.
e)
Whether the relative gain to the general public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon the owner of the subject lot or parcel under the current zoning substantially promotes the general welfare of the public.
f)
The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned, considered in the context of land development in the area and in the vicinity of the proposed land to be rezoned.
g)
Whether the lot or parcel sought to be rezoned/annexed under the proposed amendment is in conformity or divergence with the policy and intent of the adopted Joint Comprehensive Plan/equivalent, as amended.

(Ord. No. 2014-0324, § 1, 3-24-14)
Section 1-9 - Conditional use (special use) standards.

d)
Whether the proposed use will not adversely affect the health, safety, security, morals, or general welfare or residents, visitor or workers in the area; and
