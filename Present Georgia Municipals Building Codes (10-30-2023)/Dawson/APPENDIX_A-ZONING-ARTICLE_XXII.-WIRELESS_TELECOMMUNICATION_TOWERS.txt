(Ord. No. 2018-03, § 1(Exh. A, § C), 6-14-18)
Sec. 22.04. - General provisions.
The following requirements apply to all wireless telecommunications facilities regardless of the zoning district in which they are to be located. These general standards are to be supplemented with the specific regulations for each zoning district found in the following sections.
A.
When the proposed wireless telecommunications facility is to include a new tower, a plot plan at a scale of not less than one inch is equal to 100 feet shall be submitted. This plot plan shall indicate all building uses within 300 feet of the proposed facility. Aerial photos and/or renderings may augment the plot plan.
B.
The location of the tower and equipment shelter shall comply with all natural resource protection standards established in the Zoning Code, including those for floodplain, wetlands, and steep slopes.
C.
Security fencing eight feet in height shall surround the tower, equipment shelter and any guy wires, either completely or individually as determined by the City Council.
D.
The following buffer plantings may be located around the perimeter of the security fence as deemed appropriate by the City Council.
1)
An evergreen screen shall be planted that consists of either a hedge, planted three feet on center maximum, or a row of evergreen trees planted five feet on center maximum.
E.
Existing vegetation (trees and shrubs) shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible.
F.
No new tower, except amateur radio towers, shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department and City Council that no existing tower or existing alternative tower structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts and shall consist of more than mere conclusory statements that no existing tower is suitable. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of one or more of the following:
1)
That no existing towers or suitable alternative tower structures are located within the geographic antenna placement area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
2)
That existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's antenna and related equipment.
3)
That the applicant's proposed antenna(s) would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna(s) on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
4)
That the cost or contractual provisions required by the tower owner to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable.
5)
That the applicant adequately demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
G.
Any application to locate an antenna on a building or structure that is listed on an historic register, or is in a historic district shall be subject to review by the municipality's Architectural Review Board, Building Commissioner, or City Council if there is no such review board or officer.
H.
The tower shall be painted a non-contrasting gray or similar color minimizing its visibility, unless otherwise required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Towers or antennas shall maintain either a galvanized steel or concrete finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA and FCC, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. At all tower sites, the design of all buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and building environment.
I.
No advertising is permitted anywhere on the facility, with the exception of identification signage.
J.
All providers utilizing towers shall present a report to the City Clerk notifying them of any tower facility locate in the municipality whose use will be discontinued and the date this use will cease. If at any time the use of the facility is discontinued for 180 days, a designated local official may declare the facility abandoned. (This excludes any dormancy period between construction and the initial use of the facility.) The facility's owner/operator will receive written notice from the City Clerk and will be instructed to either reactivate the facility's use within 180 days, or dismantle and remove the facility. If reactivation or dismantling does not occur, the municipality will remove or will contract to have removed the facility and assess the owner/operator the costs.
K.
No tower under 150 feet shall be artificially lighted except to assure safety or as required by the FAA. Any tower between 150 and 200 feet in height shall follow safe marking and obstruction lighting as prescribed by the FAA. Security lighting around the equipment shelter is permitted. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. In the event that a tower requires lighting by virtue of its height, the city may require the construction of the tower at a lower height in order to avoid lighting requirements.
L.
"No Trespassing" signs shall be posted around the facility with a telephone number of who to contact in the event of an emergency.
M.
Applicants will provide evidence of legal access to the tower site thereby maintaining this access regardless of other developments that may take place on the site.
N.
A Conditional Use Permit must be approved by the City Council with a subsequent Building Permit issued by the City Clerk for construction of new towers in nonindustrial districts. A conditional use permit should comply with all requirements for building permits set forth in this chapter. Collocation of antennas on a single tower, antennas attached to existing structures/building, towers located in industrial districts, or replacement towers to be constructed at the site of a current tower are permitted used and will not be subject to the conditional use permitting process.
O.
Any decision to deny a request to place, construct or modify a wireless telecommunications antenna and/or tower shall be in writing and supported by evidence contained in a written record of the proceedings of the City Council.
P.
Underground equipment shelters are encouraged, especially in nonindustrial districts, and may be requested by the City Council.
Q.
Upon the transfer of ownership of any tower, alternative tower structure, or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the tower permittee shall notify the department of the transaction in writing within 30 days.
