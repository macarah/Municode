In all sections of the franchise area where the cable, wires, or other similar facilities or public utilities are placed underground, the grantee shall place its cables, wires, or other like facilities underground to the maximum extent that existing technology reasonably permits the grantee to do so.
(Code 1974, § 4-103(IX))

(b)
Failure on the part of a grantee to commence and diligently pursue each of the foregoing requirements and to complete each of the matters set forth herein, shall be grounds for termination of its franchise pursuant to the terms of section 13-52(b) and section 13-53(b); provided, however, that the franchise authority may in its discretion extend the time for the commencement and completion of construction and installation for additional periods in the event the grantee, acting in good faith, experiences delays by reasons of circumstances beyond its control.
(c)
In the event the operation of any part of a cable television system is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, or in the event such system has been installed in any public street without complying with the requirements of the grantee's franchise, the grantee shall promptly, upon being given ten (10) days' notice, remove from the streets or public places all such property and poles of such system.

The bond shall provide for thirty (30) days prior written notice to the franchise authority of any intention on the part of the grantee to cancel, fail to renew, or otherwise materially alter its terms.
(b)
Neither the filing of an indemnity bond with the agency, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the franchise authority thereunder, shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the grantee or limit the liability of the grantee under the terms of its franchise for damages, either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise.

The amount of any application fee shall be a credit against the first year's franchise fee.
(b)
A grantee shall file with the agency, within ninety (90) days after the expiration of any calendar year or portion thereof during which its franchise is in force, a financial statement certified by a responsible officer of the grantee, showing in detail the gross revenues, as defined herein, of the grantee during the preceding calendar year or portion thereof. It shall be the duty of the grantee to pay the franchise entity within fifteen (15) days after the time for filing such statement, the sum prescribed above or any unpaid balance thereof for the calendar year covered by such statements.
(c)
The franchise entity shall have the right to inspect the grantee's records showing the gross subscriber revenues from which its franchise payments are computed and shall also have the right of audit and recomputation of any and all amounts paid under this article. No acceptance of payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the franchise entity may have for further or additional sums payable under this article or for the performance of any other obligation hereunder; however, an accounting rendered to the franchise entity and to which no exception is made within three (3) years after receipt by the franchise entity shall be deemed to be accurate and shall not thereafter be subject to question or made the basis of any claim by franchise entity against grantee.

(2)
Support its credit and attract necessary capital under efficient and economical management;
(3)
Provide a return to equity owners commensurate with current returns on investment in other enterprises having corresponding risks.
(c)
No rate established shall afford any undue preference or advantage among subscribers, but separate rates may be established for separate classes of subscribers, and rates may reflect the increased cost of providing service to isolated or sparsely populated areas.
(d)
Should grantee desire to change any rate or rates, it shall notify each subscriber and the franchising authority, in writing, of the intended change, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date the change is to be effective.

(b)
Upon receipt of a request for a renewal of a franchise, the franchise authority shall then render a decision to renew or not to renew the grantee's franchise, and if the former course is taken, whether or not its franchise should be modified in any way.
