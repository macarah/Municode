i.
For one- and two-family dwellings, the required fire flow is reduced by 50 percent in sprinkled buildings.
ii.
For buildings other than one- and two-family dwellings, the fire flow can be reduced up to 75 percent, but the resulting fire flow cannot be reduced below 1,500 gallons per minute.
1.
Fire flow calculation area: The fire flow calculation area shall be the total floor area of all floor levels within the exterior walls, and under the horizontal projections of the roof of a building, except as modified in Section B104.3IFC.
2.
Separate fire flow calculation areas: Portions of a building which are separated by fire walls without openings, constructed in accordance with the International Building Code (IBC 702.1), may be considered as separate fire flow calculation areas.
3.
Fire wall: A fire-resistance rated wall having protected openings (no openings of any kind, whether protected or otherwise, are allowed for separating fire flow calculation areas) which restricts the spread of fire.
b.
Dividing the building into separate fire flow calculation areas constructed in accordance with the International Building Code (IBC). The fire flow for each fire flow calculation area within the building is then calculated according to Table B105.1IFC.
(3)
