If, after notice and hearing as provided above, the magistrate court determines that the dwelling, building, structure, or property under consideration is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use; or is vacant, and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall issue an order that states in writing its findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing, an order as follows:
(a)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, structure, or property can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property requiring the owner within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such dwelling, building, structure, or property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation, and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
(b)
If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling, building, structure, or property cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property.
For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure or property" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia Appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. Title 43, Chapter 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alternation, or improvement of the structure shall be the costs necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in Dawson County.

Sec. 48-8. - Failure to comply with order of the court.

Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The marshal's office shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the dwelling, building, structure, or property a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this dwelling, building or structure is prohibited and unlawful."
(Ord. of 12-1-2022(1))
Sec. 48-9. - Salvage of reusable materials.

Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid, according to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9(a)(6). The marshal's office and board of commissioners are relieved of any and all liability resulting from, or occasioned by, the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials consistent with O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9(a)(6).

(b)
Upon final determination of costs, fees and expenses incurred in accordance with this section, the marshal's office shall transmit to the Dawson County Tax Commissioner a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties.
