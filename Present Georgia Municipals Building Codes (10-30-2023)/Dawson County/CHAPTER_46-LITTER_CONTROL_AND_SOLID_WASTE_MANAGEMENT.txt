Every person in possession, charge or control of any building or residence from which trash, industrial waste or other waste is accumulated or produced shall provide and keep in a suitable place readily accessible to licensed private collectors' receptacles and containers suitable for the storage of all such waste materials which will normally accumulate between the established collection dates. This provision shall not be construed to require such persons to use the services of a licensed private collector for solid wastes removal so long as each person assures the removal and disposal of such solid wastes in a manner permitted by this chapter at least as frequently as private collector's normal schedule for the area, but in any event at least once each week.
(2)
All receptacles and containers as required by this chapter shall be constructed of an opaque, non-porous material such as metals, hard plastics or similar materials, or safe construction and design and shall be maintained in good, orderly and serviceable condition at all times. Any receptacle or container which does not conform to the requirements of this chapter, or which have ragged or sharp edges or any other defects likely to hamper or injure the person collecting the contents therefrom or the public generally, shall be promptly replaced by the user thereof.
(g)
Maintenance. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the owner of any private property and the tenant in possession of any private property, jointly and severally, to keep the property in an orderly condition and maintained so as not to be a public nuisance or a menace to public health.
(h)
Burning. No garbage, solid wastes, litter or other trash shall be burned as a private means of disposal.

The distribution of information such as public announcement, political endorsement, opinions, invitation, solicitations, and commercial advertisements is an activity protected by both the U.S. Constitution and the Georgia Constitution. This section is to regulate and control litter incidental to the distribution of papers and packaging.

Unless otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, nothing herein shall restrict the placement of any handbill, circular, pamphlet, poster, or other literature on any automobile in the county so long as the same is secured to prevent wind-driven debris and unsightly litter.

Unless otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, nothing herein shall restrict the placement on any private property any handbill, circular, pamphlet, poster, postcard, newspaper or other literature or advertising device, so longs the following conditions are met:
a.
Such publications and materials may be placed in a box provided for that purpose, secured to a doorknob or placed in a secure area of a building such as a door jamb or screen door; or
b.
Such publications and materials may be placed or thrown on to private property so long as the distributor of such materials "sweeps" the distribution area and retrieves all remaining items within four days of distribution. This procedure shall be referred to as "sweeping." Any papers distributed and not "Swept" from private property, vacant lands, and/or public rights of way become litter under this ordinance after four days, and citations can be issued pursuant to this ordinance for violations thereof.
(3)
Should such publications and materials be placed or thrown on to private property and the owner of said property notifies the publisher in writing that he/she does not wish to receive such publications at a particular street address, continued delivery of publication directly to said property by the publisher or his/her agents shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Absent a written expression of intent to the contrary, a property owner shall be presumed to consent to delivery by such means.
(4)
It shall be unlawful for any person to tack, post, or nail any paper, metal, wood or other signs of any character on any telegraph, telephone or electric light pole, located in any public right-of-way or in any means erect said signs within the public right-of-way.

For purposes of sentencing, the first citation before the magistrate court shall be deemed the "first offense," however; consideration may be given by the court to the previous warning citation.
