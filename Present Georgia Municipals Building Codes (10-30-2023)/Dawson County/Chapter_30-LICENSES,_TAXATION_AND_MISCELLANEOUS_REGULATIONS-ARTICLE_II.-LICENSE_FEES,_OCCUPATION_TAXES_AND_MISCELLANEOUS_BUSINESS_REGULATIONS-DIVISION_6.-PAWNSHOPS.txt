(Ord. of 11-19-2009, § 6.02)
Sec. 30-241. - Application for license; issuance of license.
(a)
Application.
(1)
All persons 25 years of age or older desiring to obtain a license required under this division shall make written application to the board of commissioners through the planning and development department for such privilege, and shall supply such information as may be required by the county manager or designee. The application shall be sworn to by the applicant or agent thereof.
(2)
All applicants shall furnish all data, information and records requested of them. Failure to furnish such data, information and records within 30 days from the date of such request shall automatically serve to dismiss the application, with prejudice. An applicant, by filing an application, agrees to produce for oral interrogation any persons who are considered as being important in the ascertainment of the facts relative to such license, as may be requested by the board of commissioners or its duly authorized representative. The failure to produce such persons within 30 days after being requested to do so shall result in the automatic dismissal of such application.
(b)
Notification to county of changes in information. Licensees shall immediately notify the county, in writing, through the planning and development department, of any change in any information, material or data furnished in connection with an application for a license, or of any material change in the type of business or ownership or qualifications of the applicant or employees subsequent to license issuance.
(c)
Citizenship and residency requirements.
(1)
No license shall be granted under this division to any applicant who is not a citizen of the United States and who has not been a resident of the county for a period of one year prior to filing the application.
(2)
Where the applicant is a corporation, the majority stockholder must meet the residence requirements set out in subsection (c)(1) of this section, and the license shall be issued to the corporation and the majority stockholder.
(3)
If the applicant is a partnership, the requirements pertaining to corporations shall apply.
(d)
Applicants with prior convictions.
(1)
No license shall be issued under this division to any person for pecuniary gain where any individual having an interest, either as owner, partner, principal stockholder or licensee, whether such interest is direct or indirect, or beneficial or absolute, or his spouse, has been convicted or has taken a plea of nolo contendere, within five years immediately prior to the filing of the application, for any felony or misdemeanor of any state or of the United States or any municipal or county ordinance which would have any effect on the applicant's ability to properly conduct such a business, except traffic offenses. The term "conviction," as used in this section, shall include an adjudication of guilt or plea of guilty, plea of nolo contendere or forfeiture of a bond when charged with a crime. Where the violation is for a misdemeanor, forfeiture of bond or violation of a county ordinance, or where there is a plea of nolo contendere, the county manager or designee may, after investigation, waive the violation as a disqualification.
(2)
The board of commissioners, on appeal, may waive any conviction as a disqualification if it finds that it would have no material effect upon the applicant's ability to properly conduct its business if such license were granted.
(e)
Investigation of applicant. All applications for a license for a pawnshop shall be investigated by the county marshal. No license shall be issued by the county manager or designee to any person until such time as a signed and notarized background check consent form has been filed by such person with the marshal's office or such department's designee and upon payment of a fee that shall be established by the board of commissioners and a search of the criminal record of the applicant is completed. The background check consent form shall include, but not be limited, to the name, date of birth, address, citizenship status and prior arrest record of the person, though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order. Applications must be accompanied by a valid government issued I.D. card. (for example a drivers license or state issued I.D. card). The marshal shall report his recommendations to the board of commissioners. A copy of such report shall be filed with the planning and development department.
(f)
Time limit for obtaining license. All licenses must be obtained and fees paid not later than two weeks from the date of the approval of the application by the board of commissioners, and, if not so obtained, the approval granted by the board of commissioners shall be void.
(g)
Issuance. When a license has been approved and the applicant has deposited with the planning and development department the required fee, the license shall be issued.
(Ord. of 11-19-2009, § 6.03)
Sec. 30-242. - Display of license number.

(a)
All holders of licenses under this division must, within three months after the issuance of the license, open the establishment referred to in the license for business, unless such period is extended by the county manager or designee. Failure to open the licensed establishment within the three-month period shall serve as an automatic forfeiture and cancellation of the unused license, and no refund of license fees shall be made to the license holder.
(b)
Any holder of a license who shall begin the operation of the business as authorized in the license, but who shall for a period of three consecutive months thereafter cease to operate the business as authorized in the license, shall, upon completion of the three-month period, automatically forfeit his license, and the license shall, by virtue of such failure to operate, be canceled without the necessity for any further action of the county manager or designee.

Sec. 30-244. - Transfer of license.
No license granted to a pawnshop shall be transferable except upon application to the board of commissioners in the same form and manner and subject to the same requirements with respect to the transferee as are applicable in an original application. Any such license may be transferred only to another person doing the same business at the same place as the person to whom the license was originally issued. When permission for transfer has been granted, the original licensee or transferee shall cause the license to be delivered to the county manager or designee who shall record such transfer, and the transferee shall pay a fee therefore as a condition precedent to engaging in operations under the license. The fee for such transfer shall be kept on file as part of the schedule of fees in the planning and development department.
(Ord. of 11-19-2009, § 6.06)
Sec. 30-245. - Required records; inspection of records and goods.

In such books there shall be entered also the name of the person by whom the division was pledged, pawned or sold, and the time when the division was pledged, pawned or sold. These entries shall be made as soon after the transaction as possible, and in no event more than one hour thereafter. Such books, and the articles themselves so pledged, pawned or sold, shall at all times be subject to inspection and examination by the county marshal and/or the sheriff. Any person subject to this division, or any licensee or employee thereof, who shall fail or refuse to keep books as provided in this section or shall make false entries concerning the transactions named, or who shall fail or refuse to permit an inspection or examination by any law enforcement officer of the books and of the property pledged or sold to the licensee shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine and/or imprisonment in accord with the limits established in O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20.

Sec. 30-247. - Employee permits.
No person shall be employed by a pawnshop in any capacity until such person has been issued an annual personal identification card or permit by the county marshal, authorizing such person to be employed by a pawnshop.
