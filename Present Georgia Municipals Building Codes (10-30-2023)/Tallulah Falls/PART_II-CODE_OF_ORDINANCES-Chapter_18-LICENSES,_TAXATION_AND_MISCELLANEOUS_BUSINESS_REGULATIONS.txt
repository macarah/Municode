ARTICLE V. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT

Sec. 18-115. - Short title; purpose.
(a)
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Adult Entertainment Ordinance".
(b)
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
Sec. 18-116. - Findings.
The town council has researched and examined case studies of the effect of adult entertainment businesses on towns similar in size and geography to the town and has found certain conditions to be attendant to the establishment of adult entertainment businesses. Such conditions have been found by the town council to be all negative in nature and include, but are not limited to, increased disorderly conduct, prostitution, drug trafficking, and drug use. Such conditions have also been determined to increase the expenditure of resources on local law enforcement, to increase the burden on the judicial system and to increase community blight on certain areas. The town council, therefore, determines that it is in the public welfare and government interest to seek to prevent, through the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the occurrence of these attendant conditions associated with adult entertainment businesses. The town council also finds that the establishment of adult entertainment businesses in towns similarly situated to the town has had a negative effect on property values in surrounding residential neighborhoods.
