ARTICLE I. - BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS[1]

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Printed herein is 1937 Ga. Laws (Act. No. 341), p. 1294, as enacted by the Georgia General Assembly. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Act. The General Assembly did not amend the text in every section of the original Act to change references from "the Commissioner of Roads and Revenues," "the Commissioner and his advisors" to "the Board of Commissioners." Accordingly, where such obsolete references appear, they should be considered as referring to the board of commissioners in proper grammatical context. Any provisions regarding the notice to introduce legislation and the jurat have been omitted. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. The style used for headings and catchlines has been made uniform and consistent with those appearing in the Code. Additions made for clarity, such as consistent state statute citations and catchline modifications, are indicated by brackets.
