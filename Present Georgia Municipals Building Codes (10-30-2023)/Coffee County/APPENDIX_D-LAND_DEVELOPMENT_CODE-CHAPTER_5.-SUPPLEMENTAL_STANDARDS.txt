c.
In recognition of this, the State of Georgia specifically prohibited the use of video poker machines in 2006;
d.
Since 2006, various programs have been created that allow computers and other electronic machines and devices to conduct a sweepstakes which purportedly entitle participants to have a chance to win various prizes and rewards in return for the purchase of token services or products such as internet service, telephone cards, and office supplies, among other products; and
e.
Certain companies are advertising on the Internet that these Sweepstakes are legal in the State of Georgia; and

These websites explain how to evade the gambling laws in states such as Georgia by establishing Sweepstakes Parlors; and
g.
These business models appear to represent an attempt to circumvent the laws of the State of Georgia that generally prohibit gambling and illegal lotteries; and

The County Commission finds that requiring participants in a Sweepstakes scheme to pay any tangible consideration to the operator of such business in the form of money or other property or thing of value and/or to purchase any goods, wares, merchandise, services or anything of value from such business to be eligible for a prize further constitutes an illegal lottery; and

On March 15, 2011, the Hon. Samuel Olens, Attorney General of the State of Georgia, also concluded that such a method of business was illegal;
