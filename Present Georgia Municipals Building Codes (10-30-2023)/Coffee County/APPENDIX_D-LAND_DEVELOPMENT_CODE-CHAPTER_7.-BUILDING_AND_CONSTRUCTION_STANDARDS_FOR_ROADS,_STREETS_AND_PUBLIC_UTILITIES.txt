7-1. - Authority.
This chapter is adopted under the authority of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and laws enacted pursuant thereto.
7-2. - Purpose, Intent and Application.
It is the intent of this chapter to apply to and provide guidance for the development of lands within Coffee County, Georgia, whether the developments involve the subdivision of land or the construction of buildings and/or other improvements on a single parcel. Any land development activity must first comply with this Code. These regulations are intended to serve the following purposes.
a.
To protect and promote the health, safety and general welfare.
b.
Encourage economically sound and orderly land development in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and other policies and objectives of the County.
c.
To assure the provision of required streets, utilities, and other facilities and services to new developments and to redevelopments in conformance with public improvement policies of the County.
d.
To assure adequate provision of safe and convenient traffic access and circulation, both vehicular and pedestrian, in new land developments and in redevelopments.
7-3. - General Provisions.
a.
Zoning Ordinance. Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions required under this section and those contained in other ordinances or regulations of Coffee County, the most restrictive, as determined by Coffee County, shall apply.
b.
Required Public Improvements. Every developer of lands within the jurisdiction of this Code shall provide the public improvements included in this Code, in accordance with this Code and other pertinent ordinances, codes, and regulations of the County. These public improvements together with associated rights-of-way, easements, and other lands shall be provided at no cost to the County and shall be dedicated or otherwise transferred, as required, to the public in perpetuity and without covenant or reservation.
c.
Other Permits. Nothing in this Code shall impose any obligation on the County to obtain or assist in obtaining permits, approvals, and/or clearances from other local, state or Federal agencies having jurisdiction over elements of a project. It is solely the developer's responsibility to obtain all such required permits, approvals, and/or clearances. The developer shall furnish the Zoning Administrator with copies of all such permits, approvals and/or clearances before authorization to proceed with development.
7-4. - Street Improvement Standards.
Public Streets, whether abutting or internal, existing or new, shall be constructed or improved under those circumstances and to the standards as established in this section. Roadway improvements shall be in accordance with the following street classification system:
a.
Arterial. These roadways provide mobility so traffic can move from one place to another quickly and safely.
b.
Collector. These roadways link arterials and local roads and perform some duties of each.
c.
Local. These roadways provide access to homes, businesses and other property.
7-5. - Right-of-Way Requirements.
a.
Minimum Right-of-Way and Pavement Widths:
i.
The minimum widths for public rights-of-way or private street ingress/egress easements and pavements shall be as shown in "Table of Minimum Right-of-Way and Lane Widths." See Standard Drawings for detailed dimensions.
ii.
Minimum widths of right-of-way and lanes shall be as shown in the "Table of Right-of-Way and Lane Widths."

Lane widths on collector streets and other local (non-subdivision) streets will be based on design speed and traffic volumes
Number of lanes will be determined based on traffic volumes, except for subdivision streets which will be typically two lanes only.
Typical section details are show in Standard Drawings.
Should the required cut and fill slopes of the roadway extend beyond the minimum width, additional right-of-way shall be provided such that all cut and fill slopes are located within the dedicated right-of-way
Additional right-of-way may be required at intersections or other locations fronting the property where turning lanes, storage lanes, medians, re-alignments or other traffic safety improvements are required by the County or the State of Georgia.
Circumstances where additional R O W may be necessary:
On any existing street abutting a proposed development, one-half of the required width of right-of-way shall be dedicated, at no cost to the County, as measured from the centerline of the roadway along the entire property frontage. Right-of-way widths for existing streets shall be based on the current classification as determined by the County.
See chapter 10.
  7-6. - Clear Zone Requirements.
a.
All new roads/streets shall meet ASHTO requirements.
7-7. - Access Management.
Applicability: Except for development projects consisting of single-family dwelling units that are not part of a larger common development, the following standards shall apply. These standards shall apply unless a more restrictive standard is required by the GDOT. See chapter 4, section 4-9.6(a).
Standards:
a.
Separation of Access Points:
i.
Proposed driveways along state or federal highways shall be permitted by the Georgia Department of Transportation.
ii.
Corner lot access shall be from the street with the lowest traffic count and shall be located as far from the intersection as reasonably possible to reduce turning movement conflicts and to promote proper traffic circulation.
b.
Emergency Access: All public streets, private and residential drives shall be designed and maintained so as to provide safe and convenient access for emergency vehicles, as required by the County. New developments with restricted access, such as gated subdivisions must receive a variance from this requirement based on review and approval by Coffee County or its designee.
c.
Traffic-Calming Measures: Street layout and configuration within residential areas/developments should include a series of relatively short interconnected roadways in lieu of longer straight roads, to discourage excessive speeds. Additional traffic-calming measures may be required by the County. Any specific measures employed shall be approved by the County.

e.
Driveways shall be located so that the radius return is a minimum of four feet from a property line that intersects the right-of-way line.
f.
The County Road Department may reduce the required separation distance of access points where the minimum required distance proves impractical or if the site plan incorporates a unified access and circulation system for vehicles and pedestrians.
g.
The requirements of this section are not intended to eliminate all access to a parcel of land that was legally subdivided prior to the enactment of this section.
7-8. - Permits Required.
a.
No driveway shall be constructed abutting a County-maintained road or street until all applicable driveway permits have been approved and issued by the County. For driveways that abut a state or federal highway, all applicable permits shall be obtained from the GDOT prior to construction. See chapter 10, section 10-29(c).
7-9. - Deceleration Lanes.

If a substandard street (dirt or gravel road or inadequate width of pavement or right-of-way) provides a means of access to a development, the street shall be upgraded to the street classification standard required by this Article, contemporaneous with the subdivision development. These improvements shall extend from the entrance of the development to the nearest standard road of an equivalent or higher classification, along the route of primary access.
ii.
The upgrading of substandard streets used for access will not be required if any of the following conditions are met:
a.
The development consists of a single one- or two-family residence, not part of a larger common development, on an existing recorded lot within the County.
d.
Permanent Dead-end Streets: New streets shall connect at both ends to existing or proposed streets unless the County Engineer determines that unique parcel configuration or terrain makes a fully connected street pattern infeasible or unsafe.
i.
When necessary, streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall provide a cul-de-sac turnaround and may be no more than 2,640 ft. in length including the cul-de-sac, unless otherwise approved by the County Engineer.
ii.
The length of a cul-de-sac street shall be measured from the center of the cul-de-sac to the center of the intersection with another street.

b.
Street Centerline Grades:
i.
Street or road grades exceeding ten percent for a minor collector and 12 percent for local streets are prohibited, unless otherwise approved by the County Engineer. The County Engineer may grant limited exceptions on maximum grades, based on conclusive evidence that shows a lesser grade is impractical due to topographic or site specific limitations.
ii.
The minimum centerline grade for street or roadway with curb and gutter shall not be less than 0.5 percent. Streets with roadside ditches should be limited to a minimum of 0.03 percent.
iii.
The maximum centerline grade across any cul-de-sac turnaround shall be two percent.
