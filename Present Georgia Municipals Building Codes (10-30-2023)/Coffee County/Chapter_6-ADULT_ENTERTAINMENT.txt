Chapter 6 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT[1]
Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
State Law reference— Governing authority has power to enact legislation to restrict operation of adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, and adult movie houses to areas zoned for commercial or industrial purposes, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3; establishment, maintenance or use of building, structure or place for unlawful sexual purposes, O.C.G.A. § 41-3-1.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 6-1. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses may be curtailed. It is recognized that such regulation cannot in a de facto manner approach prohibition; otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. This chapter represents a balancing of competing interest as to adult entertainment establishments: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and the patrons thereof.
