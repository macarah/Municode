ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 20-1. - Procedures for acquisitions by sale or donation of property with a low fair market value.
When Sumter County seeks as a condemning authority to obtain a fee simple interest in real property, the acquisition by sale or donation of any such property with a low fair market value shall be conducted as follows:
(a)
The board of commissioners may determine that an appraisal is unnecessary if the assessment of the property's value is uncomplicated and the anticipated value of the property is estimated at $10,000.00 or less, based on a review of available data. When an appraisal is determined to be unnecessary, the board of commissioners shall select a person with sufficient understanding of the local real estate market to prepare a value estimate.
(b)
The board of commissioners may approve acquisitions exceeding the $10,000.00 threshold, up to a maximum of $25,000.00, without an appraisal if the property owner is offered the option of having the county appraise the property and declines an appraisal. If the property owner elects to have the county appraise the property, the county shall obtain an appraisal and shall not use the above-described procedures.
