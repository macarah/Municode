The authority shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems it expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether or not the bonds to be refunded have matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted under this Act.

(h)
Bonds of the authority shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the Superior Court of Sumter County may be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the date on which such bonds were validated; and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state.
(i)
With respect to the validation of bonds, in lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which bonds to be issued by the authority are to bear, the notice to the district attorney or the Attorney General, the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing, and the petition and complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued will bear interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) specified in such notices and petition and complaint or may state that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) so specified; provided, however, that nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of the authority to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such notices and in the petition and complaint.
(j)
The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed in this Act whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of the authority, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority, or in notices or proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority.

(c)
Issuance by the authority of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, mortgage, deed to secure debt, trust deed, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the authority to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue.
Section 8. - Obligations of authority not public debt of state or political subdivision thereof.
No bonds, notes, or other obligations of, and no indebtedness incurred by, the authority shall constitute an indebtedness or obligation of the State of Georgia or any county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof, nor shall any act of the authority in any manner constitute or result in the creation of an indebtedness of this state or any county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof. No holder or holders of any such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state or county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof, nor to enforce the payment thereof against the state or any such county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision.
Section 9. - Constitutional authority for enactment of Act; tax exemption.

The authority is created for nonprofit and public purposes; and it is found, determined, and declared that the creation of the authority and the carrying out of its corporate purposes is in all respects for the benefit of the people of this state and that the authority is an institution of purely public charity and will be performing an essential governmental function in the exercise of the power conferred upon it by this Act; and for such reasons the state covenants with the holders from time to time of the bonds, notes, and other obligations issued under this Act that the authority shall not be required to pay any taxes of any kind or assessments imposed by this state or any counties, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, or taxing districts thereof upon any property acquired by the authority or under its jurisdiction, control, possession, or supervision or leased by it or others or upon its activities in the purchase, use, sale, disposition, operation, or maintenance of any such property or on any income derived by the authority in the form of fees, recording fees, rentals, charges, purchase price, installments, or otherwise; provided, however, that the leasehold interests of private parties leasing property from the authority shall be subject to the taxes or assessments imposed by this state or any counties, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, or taxing districts, unless they are specifically exempted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors of the authority. The bonds, notes, and other obligations of the authority, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation within this state. Deeds to secure debt and similar instruments given and recorded to support or to secure the bonds, notes, or obligations of the authority or to support or to secure obligations pledged in support of the bonds, notes, or obligations of the authority shall be exempt from all intangibles, intangibles recording, and other taxation within this state.

The board may levy taxes, fees, and assessments within the district only on real property used nonresidentially, specifically excluding property exempt from ad valorem taxation under the Constitution or laws of the State of Georgia and all property used for residential, agricultural, or forestry purposes and specifically excluding tangible personal property and intangible property. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed 2½ percent of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property; provided, further, that no tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall exceed any lesser limitation designated in the project specifications and that no tax, fee, or assessment shall be levied beyond any time limitation designated as provided in the project specifications. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing the projects which are specially required by the degree of development and described in the project specifications and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to Sumter County or the municipality as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by Sumter County if the district lies wholly or partly within the unincorporated area of Sumter County, and by the municipality within which it lies if it is wholly within a municipality, in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by Sumter County or the municipality, respectively. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Sumter County or municipal ad valorem taxes, respectively, and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied shall be transmitted by Sumter County or the municipality which collect same to the board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized by this Act.
(b)
The board shall levy the taxes provided in subsection (a) of this section between January 1 and June 1 each calendar year and notify in writing the collecting governing bodies by June 15 each year so they may include the levy on their regular ad valorem tax bills.
(c)
If, but for this provision, a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable, it shall continue to bear its tax millage then extent upon such event, for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding, until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded.
Section 7. - Boundaries of the districts.
(a)
The boundaries of each district shall be as designated as such by the Board of Commissioners of Sumter County if wholly within the unincorporated area of Sumter County and such municipalities within which the district may be partially located if partially within the unincorporated area of Sumter County and partially within one or more municipalities, or by the governing authority of a municipality if wholly within the incorporated are[a] thereof, as set forth in the resolutions required in Section 4 of this Act, or as may thereafter be added as hereinafter provided.
(b)
The boundaries of a district may be increased after the initial creation of a district pursuant to the following:
(1)
Written consent of:
(A)
A majority of the owners of real property within the area sought to be annexed into the community improvement district which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the administrative body of the community improvement district; and
(B)
The owners of the real property within the area sought to be annexed into the community improvement district which constitutes at least 75 percent by value of all real property within the area sought to be annexed into the community improvement district which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the administrative body of the community improvement district; and for this purpose value shall be determined by the most recent approved county ad valorem tax digest;
(2)
The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the board of the district; and
(3)
The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the governing authorities of Sumter County, if any portion of the district is or is to be in the unincorporated area of Sumter County, and such municipalities as may have area within the district before or after the annexation.
Section 8. - Debt.
Each district may incur debt without regard to the requirements of Section V of Article IX of the Constitution of Georgia, or any other provision of law prohibiting or restricting the borrowing of money or the creation of debt by political subdivisions of the State of Georgia, which debt shall be backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the district but shall not be an obligation of the State of Georgia, Sumter County, or any other unit of government of the State of Georgia other than the district.
Section 9. - Cooperation with local governments.
The services and facilities provided pursuant to this Act shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board and the governing body of Sumter County and any municipalities within which the district is partially located. If the parties to the cooperation agreement so agree, the cooperation agreement may provide that such private persons as are designated by the district perform the actual construction or improvement of the services and facilities provided by the district. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of Sumter County or any such municipality to provide services or facilities within the district; and Sumter County or such municipalities shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of their facilities located within their respective areas of any district. Said control shall include but not be limited to the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the municipality or Sumter County. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit or preempt the application of any governmental laws, ordinances, resolutions, or regulations to the district or the services or facilities provided therein.

The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the board members of the district then in office and their successors.
(d)
The board shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems it expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether or not the bonds to be refunded have matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose hereunder. The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded, with such cash adjustments as may be agreed upon, or may be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase or redemption of the bonds to be refunded.
(e)
There shall be no limitation upon the interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates on any bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district; and the usury laws of this state shall not apply to bonds, notes, or other obligations of these districts.

Bonds shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the Superior Court of Sumter County shall be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the date on which such bonds were validated; and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state.

(i)
The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed herein whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of a board, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district, or in notices or proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of a district.

(c)
Issuance by a board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceedings wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue.
Section 13. - Construction; applicability of O.C.G.A. chapter 5, title 10, known as the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973"; notice, proceeding, publication, referendum.
This Act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. The offer, sale, or issuance of bonds, notes, or other obligations by a district shall not be subject to regulation under O.C.G.A. chapter 5, title 10, known as the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973." No notice, proceeding, or publication except those required by this Act shall be necessary to the performance of any act authorized by this Act, nor shall any such act be subject to referendum.
Section 14. - Termination.
So long as a district has no debt outstanding the board of a district may terminate and dissolve the district as of a certain date; and on such date all property, rights, and obligations of the district shall devolve to Sumter County, unless the district shall lie wholly within an incorporated area, in which case the property rights and obligations of the district shall devolve to the municipality in which the district shall lie.

(10)
To contract for any period, not exceeding 50 years, with the State of Georgia, state institutions, or any municipal corporation or county or other political subdivision of this state for the use by the authority of any facilities or services of the state or any such state institution, municipal corporation, or county, or for the use by any state institution or any municipal corporation or county of any facilities or services of the authority, provided that such contracts shall deal with such activities and transactions as the authority and any such political subdivision with which the authority contracts are authorized by law to undertake;

To extend credit or make loans to any person, corporation, partnership (whether limited or general), or other entity for the costs of any project or any part of the costs of any project, which credit or loans may be evidenced or secured by loan agreements, notes, mortgages, deeds to secure debt, trust deeds, security agreements, assignments, or such other instruments, or by rentals, revenues, fees, or charges, upon such terms and conditions as the authority shall determine to be reasonable in connection with such extension of credit or loans, including provision for the establishment and maintenance of reserve funds; and, in the exercise of powers granted by this Act in connection with any project, the authority shall have the right and power to require the inclusion in any such loan agreement, note, mortgage, deed to secure debt, trust deed, security agreement, assignment, or other instrument of such provisions or requirements for guaranty of any obligations, insurance, construction, use, operation, maintenance, and financing of a project, and such other terms and conditions, as the authority may deem necessary or desirable;
(12)
Whenever revenue bonds of the authority have been validated as provided in this Act, to issue, from time to time, its notes in anticipation of the issuance of such bonds as validated and to renew, from time to time, any such notes by the issuance of new notes, whether the notes to be renewed have or have not matured. The authority may issue notes only to provide funds which would otherwise be provided by the issuance of the bonds as validated. The notes may be authorized, sold, executed, and delivered in the same manner as bonds. As with its bonds, the authority may sell such notes at public or private sale. Any resolution or resolutions authorizing notes of the authority or any issue thereof may contain any provisions which the authority is authorized to include in any resolution or resolutions authorizing bonds of the authority or any issue thereof; and the authority may include in any notes any terms, covenants, or conditions which it is authorized to include in any bonds. Validation of such bonds shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of the notes, but it shall not be required that such notes be judicially validated. Bond anticipation notes shall not be issued in an amount exceeding the par value of the bonds in anticipation of which they are to be issued;
(13)
As security for repayment of any revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority, to pledge, mortgage, convey, assign, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber any property of the authority (including, but not limited to, real property, fixtures, personal property, contracts, rights, and revenues or other funds) and to execute any lease, trust indenture, trust agreement, agreement for the sale of the authority's revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations, loan agreement, mortgage, deed to secure debt, trust deed, security agreement, assignment, or other agreement or instrument as may be necessary or desirable, in the judgment of the authority, to secure any such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations, which instruments or agreements may provide for foreclosure or forced sale of any property of the authority upon default in any obligation of the authority, either in payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or in the performance of any term or condition contained in any such agreement or instrument. The State of Georgia, on behalf of itself and each county, municipal corporation, political subdivision, or taxing district therein, waives any right it or such county, municipal corporation, political subdivision, or taxing district may have to prevent the forced sale or foreclosure of any property of the authority upon such default and agrees that any agreement or instrument encumbering such property may be foreclosed in accordance with law and the terms thereof;

(17)
To acquire, accept, or retain equitable interests, security interests, or other interests in any real property, personal property, or fixtures by loan agreement, note, mortgage, deed to secure debt, trust deed, security agreement, assignment, pledge, conveyance, contract, lien, loan agreement, or other consensual transfer in order to secure the repayment of any moneys loaned or credit extended by the authority;
(18)
To appoint, select, and employ engineers, surveyors, architects, urban or city planners, fiscal agents, attorneys, and others and to fix their compensation and pay their expenses;

(20)
To adopt bylaws governing the conduct of business by the authority, the election and duties of officers of the authority, and other matters which the authority determines to deal with in its bylaws;
(21)
To exercise any power granted by the laws of this state to public or private corporations which is not in conflict with the public purpose of the authority; and
(22)
To do all things necessary or convenient to carry out the powers conferred by this Act.
(b)
The powers enumerated in each paragraph of subsection (a) of this Code section are cumulative of and in addition to those powers enumerated in the other paragraphs of subsection (a) of this section and elsewhere in this Act; and no such power limits or restricts any other power of the authority.
(c)
The authority shall adopt a fiscal year which shall be the same as the fiscal year of the governing authority of Sumter County. At least quarterly, the authority shall pay to the governing authority of Sumter County for deposit into the county treasury any profits from authority operations after payment of expenses and any debt service; provided, however, that the authority shall be entitled to maintain a cash reserve account which shall not exceed an amount equal to 25 percent of the most recent quarterly profits; provided, further, that the governing authority of Sumter County may, at its discretion, allow the retention of a larger reserve account for good cause shown.
(d)
The authority shall, at least annually, cause an independent audit of its finances to be performed and shall present a copy of such audit to the governing authority of Sumter County, which audit shall be made available to the public.
Section 4. - Revenue bonds.
(a)
Revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by the authority shall be paid solely from the property (including, but not limited to, real property, fixtures, personal property, revenues, or other funds) pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, assigned, hypothecated, or otherwise encumbered to secure or to pay such bonds, notes, or other obligations.
(b)
All revenue bonds, notes, and other obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the authority, adopted by a majority vote of the directors of the authority present at a regular or special meeting.
(c)
Revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bear such date or dates, shall mature at such time or times (not more than 40 years from their respective dates), shall bear interest at such rate or rates (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time), shall be subject to redemption on such terms, and shall contain such other terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations may permit or provide. The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the directors of the authority then in office and their successors.
(d)
The authority shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems it expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether or not the bonds to be refunded have matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted under this Act. The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded, with such cash adjustments as may be agreed upon, or may be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase or redemption of the bonds to be refunded.
(e)
There shall be no limitation upon the amount of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations which the authority may issue. Any limitations with respect to interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates found in O.C.G.A. article 3, chapter 82, title 36, known as the "Revenue Bond Law," the usury laws of this state, or any other laws of this state shall not apply to revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority.
(f)
Bonds and other obligations of the authority shall be validated under and in accordance with O.C.G.A. article 3, chapter 82, title 36, known as the "Revenue Bond Law."
(g)
Bonds issued by the authority may be in such form, either coupon or fully registered, or both coupon and fully registered, and may be subject to such exchangeability and transferability provisions, as the bond resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or any indenture or trust agreement may provide.
(h)
Bonds of the authority shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the Superior Court of Sumter County may be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the date on which such bonds were validated; and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state.
(i)
With respect to the validation of bonds, in lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which bonds to be issued by the authority are to bear, the notice to the district attorney or the Attorney General, the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing, and the petition and complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued will bear interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) specified in such notices and petition and complaint or may state that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) so specified; provided, however, that nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of the authority to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such notices and in the petition and complaint.
(j)
The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed in this Act whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of the authority, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority, or in notices or proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority.
Section 5. - Authorized contents of agreements and instruments of authority generally; use of proceeds; subsequent issues.
(a)
Subject to the limitations and procedures provided by this Act, the agreements or instruments executed by the authority may contain such provisions not inconsistent with law as shall be determined by the board of directors of the authority.
(b)
The proceeds derived from the sale of all bonds, notes, and other obligations issued by the authority shall be held and used for the ultimate purpose of paying, directly or indirectly, as permitted by this Act, all or part of the cost of any project, or for the purpose of refunding any bonds, notes, or other obligations issued in accordance with this Act.
(c)
Issuance by the authority of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, mortgage, deed to secure debt, trust deed, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the authority to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue.
Section 6. - Obligations of authority not public debt of state or political subdivision thereof.
No bonds, notes, or other obligations of, and no indebtedness incurred by, the authority shall constitute an indebtedness or obligation of the State of Georgia or any county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof, nor shall any act of the authority in any manner constitute or result in the creation of an indebtedness of this state or any county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof. No holder or holders of any such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state or county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof, nor to enforce the payment thereof against the state or any such county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision.
Section 7. - Constitutional authority for enactment of Act; tax exemption.
This Act is enacted pursuant to authority granted the General Assembly by the Constitution of Georgia. The authority is created for nonprofit and public purposes; and it is found, determined, and declared that the creation of the authority and the carrying out of its corporate purposes is in all respects for the benefit of the people of this state and that the authority is an institution of purely public charity and will be performing an essential governmental function in the exercise of the power conferred upon it by this Act; and for such reasons the state covenants with the holders from time to time of the bonds, notes, and other obligations issued under this Act that the authority shall not be required to pay any taxes of any kind or assessments imposed by this state or any counties, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, or taxing districts thereof upon any property acquired by the authority or under its jurisdiction, control, possession, or supervision or leased by it or others or upon its activities in the purchase, use, sale, disposition, operation, or maintenance of any such property or on any income derived by the authority in the form of fees, recording fees, rentals, charges, purchase price, installments, or otherwise; and that the bonds, notes, and other obligations of the authority, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation within this state. Deeds to secure debt and similar instruments given and recorded to support or to secure the bonds, notes, or obligations of the authority or to support or to secure obligations pledged in support of the bonds, notes, or obligations of the authority shall be exempt from all intangibles, intangibles recording, and other taxation within this state.
Section 8. - Construction of Act; applicability of the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973."
This Act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. The offer, sale, or issuance of bonds, notes, or other obligations by the authority shall not be subject to regulation under O.C.G.A. chapter 5, title 10, known as the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973."
