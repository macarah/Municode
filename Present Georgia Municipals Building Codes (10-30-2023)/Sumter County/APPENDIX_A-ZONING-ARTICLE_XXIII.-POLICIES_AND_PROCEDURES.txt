All public hearings on zoning matters shall be placed on the presiding commission's agenda under a section entitled "public hearings." After an initial presentation of a specific zoning request to the presiding commission by the designated county staff, citizen comments will be heard in an orderly fashion. The presiding commission's chairman or designated representative will ask for those citizens speaking in favor of the request first, followed by those opposed to the issue.
3.
Citizens shall be requested to keep their comments as brief as possible so all who wish to be heard will have adequate opportunity to speak.

In such cases, these time limits shall apply to all speakers.
4.
Citizens shall address their comments to the presiding commission as a whole. Attacks on individuals or cross examination of commission members, county employees, or other citizens will be ruled out of order.
5.
After all citizen comments have been received, further discussion of the specific application is reserved for the presiding commission. The commission has the privilege to ask any questions of staff or any citizen present for clarification.
6.
If the planning commission is presiding over the hearing members may then vote on the application for a map or text amendment and forward the recommendation to the board of commissioners.
7.
At the official public hearing in front of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners can close the public hearing and vote on the application at the next regular voting session.
C.
Information on speakers: All speakers will be required to provide their name and address for the public record, and sign a campaign disclosure form. This form requires all those speaking in favor of, or in opposition to a rezoning to disclose whether they have made campaign contributions aggregating $250.00 or more to any member of the board of commissioners within the past two years. Such disclosure shall include the name of the commissioner(s), the dollar amount, description, and date of each such campaign contribution.

Recorded tapes of public hearings shall be kept secure and shall not be erased for one year from the date of the public hearing.

The record of the public hearing and all evidence (e.g., maps, drawings, traffic studies, etc.) submitted at the public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular zoning amendment's file.
Sec. 23.05. - Standards for exercise of zoning powers.
In order to provide for the public health, safety, morality, and general welfare of the citizens of the county, the following zoning criteria are established. The following criteria, the recommendation of the planning commission and any other factors relevant to balancing the public interest, shall be considered by the board of commissioners in making any zoning decision.
A.
Will the zoning proposal permit a use that is suitable in view of the use, development and zoning of adjacent and nearby property?
B.
What is the effect on the property value of the subject property should the existing zoning be retained?
C.
If denied, will the effect on the applicant's property value under the existing zoning be offset by the gain to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public?
D.
Has the property been undeveloped an unusual length of time as currently zoned, considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property?
E.
Will the zoning proposal result in a use that will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, schools, police protection, fire protection, public health facilities, or emergency medical services?
F.
Is the zoning proposal in conformity with the policy and intent of the future land use plan for the physical development of the area?
G.
Is the subject property well suited for the proposed zoning purpose?
H.
Will the zoning proposal adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property?
I.
Does the subject property have a reasonable economic use as currently zoned?
J.
Are there other existing or changing conditions affecting the use or development of the subject property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal?
K.
Would the change create an isolated district unrelated to the surrounding district, such as "spot zoning"?
L.
Are the present zoning district boundaries illogically drawn in relation to existing conditions in the area?
M.
Is the change requested out of scale with the needs of the county as a whole or the immediate neighborhood?
N.
Is it impossible to find adequate sites for the proposed use in districts permitting such use and already appropriately zoned?
O.
Would there be an ecological or pollution resulting from the proposed zoning if it is granted?
