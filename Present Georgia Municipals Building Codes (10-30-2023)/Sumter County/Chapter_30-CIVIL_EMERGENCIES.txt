The declaration shall state the nature of the emergency or disaster and the conditions that require the declaration. A sample form of a declaration is included in Appendix A to this article.
(c)
Request for state assistance. Consistent with a declaration of local emergency, the board of commissioners may ask the Governor to provide assistance to the county if it does not have adequate capacity to respond to the disaster or emergency such that state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives, prevent injury, protect property, protect public health or safety, or avert or lessen the threat of a disaster.
(d)
Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the board of commissioners passes a written resolution that emergency conditions no longer exist.
(e)
Effect of declaration of emergency; activation of emergency operations plan. A declaration of emergency by the Governor or a declaration of local emergency by the board of commissioners shall automatically activate the county's emergency operations plan and shall be the authority for deployment of personnel, use of any force to which the plan applies, and use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, or materials assembled, stockpiled, or arranged to be made available pursuant to the Georgia Emergency Management Act, the local emergency operations plan, and any other applicable laws. Upon a state declared emergency or a locally declared emergency:

(3)
The local emergency management director shall be authorized to execute a right of entry, license, or agreement on behalf of the county for the use of property for emergency purposes.
