Step 1. Review of sketch plan by planning commission.
Step 2. Review and approval of preliminary plat by consolidated planning commission.
Step 3. Review and approval of preliminary plat by the mayor and city council.
Step 4. Review and approval of final plat by consolidated planning commission.
Step 5. Review and approval of final plat by the mayor and city council.
Step 1 may, and step 3 shall be completed prior to making any street improvement, installing any utilities or other land disturbing activities. Step 5 shall be completed prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision. The site proposed to be subdivided must be zoned in the appropriate residential, commercial, industrial, planned development or other zoning district prior to the completion of step 2.
(Ord. of 11-13-2007, § 4.1)
Sec. 117-89. - Review procedure.
The following procedure shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats:
(1)
Sketch plan review procedures. Prior to the filing of a preliminary plat, the subdivider may submit to the secretary of the planning commission a simple sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. The sketch plan may be a simple free-hand drawing. Included with the sketch plan should be a sketch map, which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning for the preparation of the preliminary plat and enable the subdivider to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. The secretary of the planning commission shall review and approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the sketch plan within 15 days from the meeting at which it is presented. Pertinent comments and recommendations shall be noted in the minutes of the planning commission meeting.
(2)
Preliminary plat procedures. Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the secretary of the planning commission at least 25 days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the planning commission. The plat of the subdivision shall be submitted in six black-line or blue-line prints and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained herein, as well as one electronic copy in a format acceptable to the planning commission. Any preliminary plat submitted to the planning commission shall contain the name and address of the subdivider (or subdivider's designee) to whom notice of hearing may be sent; and no preliminary plat shall be acted upon by the planning commission without affording a hearing thereon, notice of time and place of which shall be sent to said address not less than five days before the date of the hearing.
a.
The planning commission may request additional copies of the plat and supplemental information. The above-mentioned copies shall be distributed as required by section 117-114(4) and additionally as deemed necessary by the secretary of the planning commission. The person or agency to which a copy of the preliminary plat is directed shall review the preliminary plat and indicate any required changes or comments on the plat and submit to the planning commission prior to the formal presentation of the preliminary plat. The local governing authority shall receive a copy for review and information.
b.
The secretary of the planning commission shall examine the preliminary plat to determine if it meets all requirements of these regulations, has approval of the health department, and/or the state environmental protection division, has been reviewed and approved by the Coastal Soil and Water Conservation District, and that the design of the roadways, drainage structures, public water and sewerage systems and other facilities related to the subdivision have been reviewed and approved by the designated engineer of the planning commission or other designated official.
c.
If water and or sewerage systems, not connected to a municipal system, are to be installed, the subdivider is to indicate who will own the system, who will operate the system and what assurance will be given to the mayor and city council for continued operation.
d.
The planning commission shall act on the preliminary plat within 45 days after formal submission and having received confirmation of all necessary approvals as described in subsection (2)b of this section. Failure of the planning commission to act within 45 days after formal submission of the complete preliminary plat shall be deemed to constitute approval and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning commission on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. The action of the commission shall be recorded in the minutes of the commission meeting.
e.
The planning commission shall vote to approve or disapprove of the preliminary plat. In the event a preliminary plat is disapproved the grounds for such disapproval shall be noted in the minutes of the planning commission and a copy of such minutes provided to the subdivider. The subdivider has the right to appeal a decision of the planning commission to disapprove the preliminary plat to the governing authority. Such appeal shall be filed in writing with the secretary of the planning commission within ten days of the decision of the planning commission. Approval of the subdivision plat shall be noted on the plat and certified by the secretary of the planning commission. Also noted shall be the date of approval and the date of written notification to the subdivider or subdivider's authorized agent. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within 18 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require the preliminary plat to be resubmitted to the planning commission for approval. The developer shall not initiate action to change any of the existing conditions reported on the preliminary plat as required by section 117-114(2) until the preliminary plat has been approved.
f.
Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets, location of other required infrastructure, and the dimensions and shapes of lots. Application for approval of the final plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified herein have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the planning commission, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat.
(3)
Final plat procedure.
a.
After completion of the physical development of public water and sewer, drainage, and roadway base and curb and gutter as shown on the approved preliminary plat, the subdivider may submit to the secretary of the planning commission 12 copies of the final plat, and one electronic copy in a format acceptable to the planning commission, prepared in accordance with the provisions of these regulations along with the required certificates executed by the appropriate officials. Application for approval of a final plat shall be submitted to the secretary of the planning commission, along with a bond or letter of credit for an amount necessary to complete any remaining improvements, at least ten days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the governing authority.
b.
Until a final plat of a subdivision has been submitted to, reviewed and approved and signed by the governing authority, the clerk of the superior court of the county shall not record the plat of such subdivision, nor shall the owner or agent of such subdivision transfer title to any lot within the subdivision by reference to the subdivision plat. For large subdivisions the final plat may be submitted for approval in contiguous sections satisfactory to the governing authority.
c.
The installation of streets, drainage systems and water and sewerage systems shall be in compliance with the governing authority's standard specifications for materials and installation procedures on file with the planning commission and the governing authority's flood regulations. The elevation of fill and the installation of streets drainage systems, and water and or sewerage systems shall be certified by the developers registered engineer as being in compliance with applicable requirements before approval of the final plat.
(4)
Final approval. Final approval of the plat shall be by the governing authority.
(5)
Certification by planning commission secretary. The secretary of the planning commission shall certify for recording all plats approved by the planning commission and the governing authority and all plats found to be exceptions under section 117-90 without referral to the governing authority. The planning commission shall retain copies of such plats as information.

ARTICLE VI. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS

Sec. 117-148. - Required improvements.
A well designed subdivision or development includes improvements that provide for the safety and security of all citizens, includes adequate open spaces for recreation and circulation, preserves and protects our wetlands, streams, and marshes and promotes the overall public good. A subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed and provide adequate levels of service. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat. Any request for an exception to these required improvements must be documented by the developer, and address the reason for the exception and why it meets the spirit and intent of these regulations.
(1)
Natural gas. When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way, where possible, such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties.
(2)
Water supply. All lots, tracts or parcels must be served by a water source. The water source shall be the city water system. When the water main is located in the street to serve the abutting lots a water service line shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced. The location of each service line shall be marked clearly on the record drawings and submitted to the governing authority.
(3)
Sanitary sewerage. Subdivisions located in city shall connect to that municipal system. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. The location of each service line shall be marked clearly on the record drawings and submitted to the governing authority.
(4)
Curbs and gutters. Concrete curbs and gutters shall be installed along new streets and roadways. Existing public roadways that are included in or are adjacent to the development or subdivision and serve as direct access to the development or to subdivision lots shall be developed and improved to the same curb and gutter and sidewalk standards as new streets. All concrete curbs shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans and standard specifications. All streets designated and shown shall be constructed and surfaced with the requirements of this article and with the details, drawings and specifications as published by the governing authority. A copy of the standard specifications will be kept on file at the planning commission. Higher standards than those required by the standard specifications may be required by the planning commission to provide adequately for unusual soil conditions, extraordinary traffic volume or other abnormal conditions. Approval of the developers plans by the reviewing engineer and planning commission is required.
(5)
Street grading and surfacing (local streets). Street grading, base preparation and surfacing of local streets shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plans and specifications. Grading, base preparation, and surfacing of local collection and arterial streets shall be installed in accordance with the standard specifications. Approval of the developer's plans by the reviewing engineer and planning commission is required.

An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, storm drains, drop inlets, bridges, and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider in accordance with the plans, standard specifications, and drainage ordinance. Approval of the developer's plans by the reviewing engineer and planning commission is required.
(7)
Signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections within a subdivision. Traffic control signs shall be installed in accordance with the Uniform Manual of Traffic Control Devices. The planning commission and the governing authority shall approve the location and design.
(8)
Topsoil. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover on the lots and at least four inches of cover between sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting.
(9)
Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be installed in all approved subdivisions in accordance with section 117-178.
(10)
Nonpotable reuse water line. A nonpotable reuse water system shall be installed in all approved subdivisions and other planned developments in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the planning commission.
(11)
Streetlights and poles. Installation of streetlights and poles shall be done by the developer, and shall be approved by the appropriate electric utility company and the planning commission. A street lighting plan, developed by the appropriate utility company, shall be submitted with the preliminary plat.
(12)
Electric and other utilities. All utilities and systems (electric, telephone, cable, etc.) shall be placed underground by the developer, and shall be installed as approved by the appropriate utility company and the planning commission. A variance from this requirement may be granted by the planning commission and the local governing authority if unique conditions meeting the requirements in article X of this chapter exist.
(13)
Other required improvements. Following a detailed review of the impact of the proposed subdivision or other planned developments described in article VIII of this chapter on the infrastructure systems of the governing authority, other improvements either on or off the site under development may be required to be installed or paid for by the developer. The planning commission shall determine the need and cost for all other required improvements and shall submit a report to the governing authority for approval.

Prior to acceptance of the improvements the governing authority must obtain the engineer certificate referred to in section 117-151 and a maintenance bond referred to in section 117-154. The acceptance of any improvements by the local governing authority shall be recorded in the official minutes of the local governing authority.
(Ord. of 11-13-2007, § 6.6)
Sec. 117-153. - Building permits.
No building permit in a subdivision shall be issued and no building other than a farm building shall be erected on any lot unless the street giving access to the lot upon which the building is proposed to be placed has been accepted or opened as, or shall have otherwise received the legal status of, a public street.
(Ord. of 11-13-2007, § 6.7)
Sec. 117-154. - Maintenance bond.
(a)

Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary of such property and a temporary turn-around shall be provided, unless the planning commission approves another system for access. Houses fronting on minor streets shall have access from minor streets only. Each subdivision should seek to provide at least two points of access (streets) to existing public streets where feasible, and in a subdivision with, or the potential for, 75 or more lots, two or more access streets shall be provided, unless the development can meet the standards for a variance as defined in article X of this chapter.
(d)
Street names. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name of the proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, irrespective of the use of suffix, street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, etc. It shall be unlawful for any person in laying out any new street or road to name such street or road on any plat, by marking, or in any deed or instrument, without first getting approval of the planning commission. The planning commission shall coordinate or cause to be coordinated with the emergency 911 department for approval of street names.
(e)
Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through-traffic will be discouraged.

Intent. It is not the intent of these regulations to freeze new developments into any single type of design. It is, however, the intent of these regulations to ensure that all new developments shall contribute to the building of economically sound, sustainable and desirable areas within the community with all necessary services and facilities. The purpose of the designation of quality developments is to allow the utilization of land while ensuring that there are little or no detrimental impacts on the environment, neighboring properties, and the public safety, welfare and interest. The intent is that all quality developments far exceed the minimum standards defined and encourage innovation in development that enhances and improves public safety and welfare.
(b)
Authority to modify standards. In order to provide the developer with maximum flexibility in the design and character of new subdivisions and other planned developments, the planning commission is hereby authorized to modify the standards and requirements, but not the intent of these regulations and zoning standards, in the case of a plan that exhibits unique quality growth features within a planned unit, which, in the judgment of the planning commission:
(1)
Provides significant public spaces for circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated;
(2)
Which exhibits unique quality features in keeping with state department of community affairs principles;
(3)
Which addresses each of the city's quality development guidelines;
(4)
Which provides such covenants or other legal provisions as will ensure conformity to and achievement of the comprehensive development plan. Any development considered for quality development status shall be analyzed using these principles and the guidelines listed below. The following is a list of the city's performance guidelines against which all proposed quality developments will be analyzed:
a.
Does the proposed development provide an appropriate and significant amount of uplands dedicated to open space, recreational, and other public uses that are available for the use and enjoyment of the residents and users of the development and citizens of the city?
b.
Will the development as designed minimize impacts to, and preserve wetlands and floodplains?
c.
Has the proposal minimized the impervious surfaces in order to minimize stormwater runoff, and does it include the use of measures such as low impact design or other strategies to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of all runoff?
d.
Are the connectivity of open spaces and wetlands maximized in such a way as to create and preserve habit areas for wildlife?
e.
Does the design maximize the preservation and protection of large hardwood trees and woodlands in wetlands and uplands?
f.
Does the proposal minimize or include mitigation for impacts on the city's, and the neighboring government's, infrastructure systems?
The planning commission shall review the proposed development in accordance with these guidelines and the principles, and may recommend modification of standards and requirements should the proposed development exceed the subdivision regulations and adequately address each of these principles and guidelines. The developer or subdivider shall request that the planning commission consider the development for designation as a quality development and provide the information required by the planning commission in order to evaluate the request for the designation and the modification of any standards or requirements.
(c)
Maintenance of spirit of regulations. Any development or subdivision approved under this section shall maintain the objectives, purposes, and intent of these regulations. To this end, the planning commission may recommend modification to the standards and requirements of these regulations and the standards defined in the city zoning ordinance.
