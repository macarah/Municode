(b)
Responsibility.

(3)
The Project Engineer responsible for the construction project or the Maintenance Foreman/Superintendent responsible for the maintenance activity requiring the reduced speed zone will be responsible for reviewing and determining the appropriate reduction in the speed limit, its duration, and the length of the work zone. A temporary speed reduction zone will be established for a section of roadway according to an identified need.

When establishing a reduced speed zone, the minimum reduction of the posted speed limit shall be no less than ten miles per hour and the maximum reduction shall be no greater than 20 miles per hour.
(c)
Documentation. The appropriate Project Engineer or Maintenance Foreman/Superintendent shall record in a diary the date and time that each temporary speed reduction zone is installed and removed, the limits of the zone, and, if applicable, the traffic direction.
(d)
Signing requirements. To temporarily reduce the speed limit in any construction or maintenance area and be in compliance with O.C.G.A. § 40-6-188, the following sequence of signs shall be required:

At a minimum of 600 feet in advance of the beginning of the reduced speed zone, a standard R2-5a (REDUCED SPEED AHEAD) sign shall be erected.
(2)
If the speed limit is to be reduced a total of 20 miles per hour, a standard R2-1 (SPEED LIMIT XX) sign shall be erected at a minimum of 600 feet in advance of the beginning of the reduced speed zone in order to reduce the speed in ten miles per hour increments.

A black on white regulatory R2-Special (WORK ZONE/SPEED LIMIT XX/MINIMUM FINE $100.00) sign shall be erected 600 feet past the previous sign erected in subsection (d)(1) or (2) of this section.
(4)
Intermediate R2-1 (SPEED LIMIT XX) signs shall be erected at intervals not to exceed one mile within the reduced speed zone.
(5)
A standard R2-1 (SPEED LIMIT XX) shall be erected 600 feet past the work zone. This sign shall post the normal speed limit for the roadway.
