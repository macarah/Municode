Upon the failure of any customer or other responsible party to pay any bill, assessment, fee, penalty, or charge for water and/or garbage services for any premises for which that party is responsible, the city is authorized, through its designated agents, servants, and/or employees to turn off and discontinue water and/or garbage service to the property location for such nonpayment. Failure to receive a bill does not relieve the customer of responsibility for all applicable charges for water and/or garbage service incurred or imposed pursuant to these policies. The city shall not be required to resume the supply of water and/or garbage service to the property until all past due charges, including any applicable late fees, fines, penalties, or other charges are fully paid.
