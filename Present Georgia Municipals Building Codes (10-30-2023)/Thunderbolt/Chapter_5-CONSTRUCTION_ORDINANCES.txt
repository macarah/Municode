ARTICLE III. - ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION—FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE
STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT,PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

Sec. 5-301. - Statutory authorization.
A.
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.) Section 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the (Mayor and Council of the Town of Thunderbolt, Georgia does ordain this ordinance and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety as well as to private and public property.
B.
Findings of fact.
(1)
The flood hazard areas of the Town of Thunderbolt are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
C.
Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(5)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
D.
Objectives. The objectives of this article are:
(1)
To protect human life and health;
(2)
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains:
(3)
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
(4)
To minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects;
(5)
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(6)
To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and
(7)
To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
( Ord. of 8-8-2018 )
Sec. 5-302. - General provision.
A.
Lands to which this article applies.
This article shall apply to all areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of Thunderbolt.
B.
Basis for areas of special flood hazard. The "Special Flood Hazard Area" identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated 8/16/2018, with accompanying maps and other supporting data, and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS, supporting data and any revision thereto, for Chatham County (*unincorporated county*), dated 8/16/2018, are hereby adopted by reference.
Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. Areas identified through standard engineering analysis but not yet incorporated in an FIS include, but are not limited to, those areas adjacent to the one-percent annual chance floodplain whose elevations are below a locally applied freeboard.
The repository for public inspection of the flood insurancestudy (FIS), accompanying maps and other supporting data is located in the zoning administrator's office at 2821 River Drive, Thunderbolt, Georgia.

B.
Specific standards. In all areas identified in the "basis for areas of special flood hazard" section, the following provisions are required:
(1)
New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure, including manufactured homes shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 5-304(A)(4), "Elevated buildings."
a.
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above two feet above the base flood elevation.
(2)

(4)
Floodway. Located within special flood hazard areas established in section 5-302(B), are areas designated as floodway.
A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris and potential projectiles and have erosion potential. By definition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the 1% annual chance flood without increasing the one-percent annual chance flood water surface elevation more than a designated one-foot rise.
Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(a)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a 1% annual chance flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
1.
Use of fill within the special flood hazard area shall result in no net loss of natural floodplain storage.
2.
Mitigation excavation on site or on an adjacent site must be connected to the special flood hazard area at an elevation less than or equal to an elevation two feet below the one-percent annual chance flood elevation
(b)
Only if section 5-304(B)(4)(a) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 5-304.
C.
Standards for special flood hazard areas without established base flood elevations and floodway (zone A). Located within the "Basis for areas of special flood hazard" established in section 5-302(B), where streams exist but no base flood data nor floodway data have been provided (Zone A), the following provisions apply:
(1)
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 5-302(B), then the zoning administrator or his/her designee shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of section 5-304. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply:
(2)
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
a.
Use of fill within the special flood hazard area shall result in no net loss of natural floodplain storage.
b.
Mitigation excavation on site or on an adjacent site must be connected to the special flood hazard area at an elevation less than or equal to an elevation two feet below the one-percent annual chance flood elevation.
(3)
In areas identified in the "basis for areas of special flood hazard areas" without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 5-304(A)(4) "elevated buildings."
(a)
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.
The zoning administrator or his/her designee shall certify the lowest floor elevation and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
D.
Standards for special flood hazard areas with established base flood elevations without designated floodways (zone AE). Located within the "Basis for areas of special flood hazard" established in section 5-302(B), where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (zones AE) the following provisions apply:
(1)
No encroachments, including fill material, new structures, or substantial improvements shall be allowed within the area of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface elevation of the one-percent annual chance flood. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
a.
Use of fill within the special flood hazard area shall result in no net loss of natural floodplain storage.
b.
Mitigation excavation on site or on an adjacent site must be connected to the special flood hazard area at an elevation less than or equal to an elevation two feet below the 1% annual chance flood elevation.
(2)
New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 5-304(B).
E.
Standards for areas of shallow flooding (zone AO). Areas identified in the "Basis for areas of special flood hazard" established in section 5-302(B), may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas.

Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 5-304(A)(4), "elevated buildings."
The zoning administrator or his/her designee shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
a.
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above two feet above the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, all heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at least four feet above the highest adjacent grade.
(2)
New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be floodproofed with permission of the administrator in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight at least three feet above the flood depth number specified in feet on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade, or in the case that no flood depth number is specified, to a height of five feet with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsection 5-303(C)(7). Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
F.
Coastal high hazard areas (zone VE). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-302(B), are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (zone VE).

(2)
All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be elevated on piles, columns, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal structural member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation level. All space below the lowest supporting member shall remain free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls. Open wood lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with subsection (F)(6) below;
(3)
All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be securely anchored on pilings, columns, or shear walls;
(4)
All pile and column foundations and the structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the combined effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on ALL building components, both (non-structural and structural). Water loading values shall equal or exceed those of the 1% annual chance flood. Wind loading values shall be in accordance with the most current edition of the Standard Building Code.
(5)
A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in section 5-304(F) herein.
(6)
All space below the lowest horizontal supporting member must remain free of obstruction.

Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The zoning administrator or his/her designee shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered:
(a)
Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction;
(b)
Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave defection to adjacent properties; and
(c)
Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping.
(10)
There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands, which would increase potential flood damage;
(11)
Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of section 5-304(F)(4) are met.
G.
Standards for subdivisions.
(1)
All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
(2)

Sec. 5-318. - Illicit discharge prohibition—General provisions.
1.
Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that:
A.
Discharges to the MS4 that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters.
B.
These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments.
C.
These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters.
D.
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters.
E.
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system.
F.
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Therefore, the Town of Thunderbolt adopts this chapter to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
2.
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the Town of Thunderbolt through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable. The objectives of this article are:
A.
To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 by stormwater discharges by any user;
B.
To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4; and
C.
To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection; surveillance and monitoring; and enforcement procedures as necessary to ensure compliance with this article.
3.
Applicability. This article shall apply to all non-stormwater discharges entering the storm drain system generated on any developed or undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by the Town of Thunderbolt under section 5-319 of this article.
4.
Discharge prohibitions.
1.
Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the MS4 or watercourses any materials, including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater.
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
A.
The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article: water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated—typically less than one PPM chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants.
B.
Discharges specified in writing by the Town of Thunderbolt as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
C.
Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the Town of Thunderbolt 24 hours prior to the time of the test followed by written notice within ten days.
D.
Any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Division, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Town of Thunderbolt prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
E.
Any stormwater discharge regulated under an NPDES stormwater discharge permit for industrial activities provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Town of Thunderbolt prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
F.
Any stormwater discharge regulated under an NPDES stormwater discharge permit for construction activities or other local land disturbance permit provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Town of Thunderbolt prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
5.
Prohibition of illicit connections. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the MS4 or watercourses is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.
6.
Suspension of MS4 access.
1.
Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations.
A.
The Town of Thunderbolt may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the Town of Thunderbolt may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
B.
Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 or watercourses in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Town of Thunderbolt will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Town of Thunderbolt for a reconsideration and hearing.
A person commits a violation of this article if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior written approval of the Town of Thunderbolt.
7.
Monitoring of discharges.
1.
Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity.
2.
Access to facilities.
A.
The Town of Thunderbolt shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the Town of Thunderbolt.
B.
Facility operators shall allow the Town of Thunderbolt ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
C.
The Town of Thunderbolt shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Town of Thunderbolt to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
D.
The Town of Thunderbolt has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
E.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the Town of Thunderbolt and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
F.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the Town of Thunderbolt access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits a violation if the person denies the Town of Thunderbolt reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article.
G.
If the Town of Thunderbolt has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the Town of Thunderbolt may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
8.
Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants.
1.
Specification of best management practices. The Town of Thunderbolt may adopt requirements identifying best management practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or facility, which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the MS4 or watercourses, or waters of the United States.
2.
Pollution prevention in new facilities. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs.
3.
Pollution prevention in existing facilities. Any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or watercourses.
4.
Discharge permits from regulatory agencies other than the Town of Thunderbolt. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section. BMPs designated for compliance with the NPDES permit or BMPs implemented as a result of action taken in compliance of this article shall be included in a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
9.
Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
10.
Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the MS4 or watercourses, or waters of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Town of Thunderbolt in person, by phone, facsimile or email no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the director of public works of the Town of Thunderbolt within three business days of the phone notice. The notification of the discharge of materials to the Town of Thunderbolt shall be in addition to notification of other applicable county, regional, state and federal authorities. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
Sec. 5-319. - Post construction stormwater runoff—General provisions.
1.
Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that:
A.
Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and increase flooding, channel erosion, and pollutant transport and deposition in rivers and streams;
B.
Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and, consequently, alter water levels and fluctuations and increase pollutant transport and deposition in wetlands;
C.
Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and alter salinity concentrations and fluctuations and increase productivity and pollutant transport and deposition in estuaries;
D.
Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and increase bacteria transport and deposition in near coastal waters, which leads to beach contamination and closure and poses a serious threat to human health;
E.
Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and, consequently, decreasing the amount of rainfall that is available to recharge shallow groundwater aquifers;
F.
The negative impacts of land development activities on these important local aquatic resources can adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of the public;
G.
The negative impacts of land development can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites;
H.
Communities within the coastal nonpoint source management area are required to comply with specific state and federal regulations that require the adverse impacts of increased stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads to be controlled and minimized;
Therefore, the Town of Thunderbolt has determined that it is in the public interest to control and minimize the adverse impacts of land development activities and has established this set of stormwater management provisions to regulate post-construction stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites.
2.
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this chapter is to protect and maintain the integrity of local aquatic resources, and, consequently, the health, safety and welfare of the general public, by establishing minimum stormwater management provisions that control and minimize the adverse impacts of land development activities. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
A.
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of local aquatic resources;
B.
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria that will reduce flooding, channel erosion, and pollutant transport and deposition in local aquatic resources;
C.
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria that will help preserve existing hydrologic conditions and development and redevelopment sites;
D.
Establish design criteria for structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria;
E.
Encourage the use of better site planning, better site design and low impact development practices, such as those found in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM) and the Coastal Stormwater Supplement (CSS), to the maximum extent practical at development and redevelopment sites to mimic the pre-development hydrologic function of the site by encouraging natural processes that detain and filter stormwater runoff pollutants;
F.
Establish provisions for the long-term upkeep and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed and pose a minimal threat to public safety;
G.
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved land development projects;
H.
Identify and protect existing natural systems from potential adverse impacts resulting from land development activities and post construction stormwater runoff; and
I.
Balance development demands and natural resource protection through the implementation of low impact planning, design and development strategies.
3.
Applicability. This chapter shall be applicable to all land development activities, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (4) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment activity within Town of Thunderbolt that meets one or more of the following criteria:
A.
New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more;
B.
Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition, or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more;
C.
Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the Town of Thunderbolt to be a hotspot land use;
D.
Development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate, and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules;
E.
For development of a project in phases, a stormwater master plan is required to conceptually indicate how the minimum requirements of this article will be met. This does not preclude the requirements of a SWMP for each phase as it is being developed. The master plan of multi-phased developments shall consolidate stormwater management facilities to as much as practical; or
F.
The existence of a stormwater master plan, approved prior to the date of adoption of this chapter, does not necessarily preclude compliance with the requirements of this chapter for each subsequent phase as it is being developed. However, the town manager or his designee will favorably consider the existence of a site-specific stormwater master plan that is substantially compliant with this chapter when evaluating the applicability of this chapter to subsequent phases of development. The town manager or his designee may require that additional requirements be incorporated into the subsequent phases of development to protect the health, safety and welfare of the general public as well as to ensure compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations.
4.
Exempt activities. The following activities are exempt from this chapter:
A.
New development or redevelopment that involves the creation, addition or replacement of less than 5,000 square feet of impervious cover and that involves less than one acre of other land disturbing activities;
B.
Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project that is otherwise subject to this chapter;
C.
Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures;
D.
Projects that are exclusively for agricultural or silvicultural activities within areas zoned for these agricultural and silvicultural use;
E.
Maintenance and repairs of any green infrastructure or stormwater management practices deemed necessary by the town manager (or his designee);
F.
Any part of a land development project that was approved by the director or their designee prior to the adoption of this chapter; and
G.
Redevelopment that constitutes the replacement of the original square footage of impervious cover and original acreage of other land development activity when the original development is wholly or partially lost due to natural disaster or other acts of God occurring after (2/08/2012).
5.
Stormwater management manual. The Town of Thunderbolt will utilize the standards, criteria, and information presented in the latest edition of the Coastal Stormwater Supplement (CSS), the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM), local design and construction standards, and any relevant local addenda, for the proper implementation of this chapter. These references may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science, engineering, monitoring, and local experience.
6.
Local stormwater design criteria. The Town of Thunderbolt may furnish additional policy, criteria and information including specifications and standards, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this chapter. This information will serve to supplement and/or clarify information set forth in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and Coastal Stormwater Supplement.
This information may include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. This information may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the Town of Thunderbolt, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards during the design and permitting phase of a land development project.

The off-site or regional stormwater management practice must be located on property legally dedicated to that purpose, be designed and sized to meet the post-construction stormwater management criteria set forth in section 5-324 of this article, provide a level of stormwater quality and quantity control that is equal to or greater than that which would be provided by on-site green infrastructure and stormwater management practices and have an associated inspection and maintenance plan agreement. In addition, appropriate stormwater management practices shall be installed, where necessary, to protect properties and drainage channels that are located between the development site and the location of the off-site or regional stormwater management practice.
To be eligible for compliance through the use of off-site stormwater management practices, the applicant must submit a stormwater management plan to the Town of Thunderbolt that shows the adequacy of the off-site or regional stormwater management practice and demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the town manager or his designee, that the off-site or regional stormwater management practice will not result in the following impacts:
i.
Increased threat of flood damage or endangerment to public health or safety;
ii.
Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams and other structures;
iii.
Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation;
iv.
Degradation of in-stream biological functions or habitat; or
v.
Water quality impairment in violation of state water quality standards and/or violation of any other state or federal regulations.
In addition, the requirement for on-site stormwater management practices can be waived if one of the two conditions stipulated below can be met to the satisfaction of the town manager or his designee: (1) the development directly discharges into open tidal waters without passing through the town's municipal separate storm sewer system, or (2) provisions are made to provide for a drainage system with adequate capacity to carry site runoff flows to open tidal waters. The town will require the developer or owner to coordinate this request with adjacent or downstream property owners and/or local governments.
Where direct discharge are requested into tidal areas, the department of natural resources and/or the corp of engineers approval is required before the stormwater management plan can be approved. New drainage outfalls into marshlands, tidal waters, or protected wetlands shall be approved by the corps of engineers and/or Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Any modification to existing outfalls that have inverts below +5.3 MSL or any modification that results in the invert being lower than mean high tide, shall be approved by the various state and federal agencies having jurisdiction. Tide control structures shall be installed where the invert elevation of the first structure is below mean high tide.
Sec. 5-322. - Variances from stormwater management requirements.
1.
Criteria for variances for providing stormwater management. The town manager or his designee may grant a variance from requirements of this chapter if exceptional circumstances applicable to a site exist such that strict adherence to the provisions of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship and will not fulfill the intent of the ordinance. The town manager or his designee may grant a variance from requirements of this chapter if the proposed development activity will not:
A.
Increase in rate, volume, or concentration of runoff to the existing downstream storm sewer system;
B.
Increase the base flood elevation upstream or downstream;
C.
Have a negative impact on any wetland, watercourse, or water body; or
D.
Contribute to degradation of water quality.
A written request for a variance shall be required and shall state the specific variance sought and the reasons a variance should be granted. The request shall be accompanied by all necessary supporting data and provided in a format that is deemed acceptable by the town. The town manager or his designee will conduct a review of the variance request within ten working days of receiving the request.
2.
Mitigation requirements for variances. Where compliance is waived and a variance is issued, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements by meeting one to the mitigation measures selected by the director. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:
A.
The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation.
B.
The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and standards of this article.
C.
Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund stormwater management activities.
Sec. 5-323. - Fee in lieu of stormwater management practices.
Where the Town of Thunderbolt issues a variances from all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, or where adequate stormwater facilities are provide through off-site stormwater management practices or direct discharge into open tidal waters, the applicant may be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the town.
When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater management, the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a fee schedule (unless the developer and the Town of Thunderbolt agree on a greater alternate contribution) established by the Town of Thunderbolt Council. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to the stormwater management program, and shall be made by the developer prior to the approval of any development activity.
Sec. 5-324. - Post-construction stormwater management criteria.
All development and redevelopment sites shall utilize structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices to control and minimize the increased stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads caused by land development in accordance with the criteria presented below. Better site planning and design techniques and low impact development practices and nonstructural stormwater controls should be used to the maximum extent practical to reduce runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads and the site's impact on the watershed. Such techniques and practices include, but are not limited to, conservation and/or restoration of natural areas, such as forests, wetlands, and riparian buffers, minimization and/or disconnection of impervious surfaces, and small-scale distributed stormwater management practices, such as rain gardens, pervious pavement, and stormwater planters, that intercept and treat or otherwise manage stormwater runoff close to its source.
For structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices not reduction rates have not been provided, the effectiveness of the structural or nonstructural stormwater management practice must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the town manager or his designee before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the post-construction stormwater management criteria, the town manager or his designee may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or due to increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the development or redevelopment site in question.
The following criteria shall apply to all land development activities and stormwater management design plans, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter:
1.
Runoff reduction. The stormwater runoff volume generated by the runoff reduction storm event, as defined in the April 2009 edition of the CSS to the GSMM, shall be reduced on-site to the maximum extent practicable in order to help maintain pre-development site hydrology and help protect local aquatic resources from several indirect impacts of the land development process, including decreased groundwater recharge, decreased base flow, and degraded water quality. In general, a stormwater management system is presumed to comply with these criteria if:
A.
It includes green infrastructure practices that provide for the interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration or capture and reuse of stormwater runoff, that have been selected, designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the information presented in the latest edition of the CSS to the GSMM and any applicable Town of Thunderbolt Design Criteria; and
B.
It is designed to provide the amount of stormwater runoff reduction specified in the April 2009 edition of the CSS to the GSMM.
The town manager or his designee may vary the amount of stormwater runoff reduction needed to satisfy this criteria on development sites that are considered to be stormwater hotspots or that have site characteristics or constraints, such as high groundwater, impermeable soils, contaminated soils or confined groundwater aquifer recharge areas, that prevent the use of green infrastructure practices that provide for the interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration or capture and reuse of stormwater runoff. When seeking a variance in the amount of stormwater runoff reduction that needs to be provided in order to satisfy these criteria, applicants are encouraged to:
A.
Use green infrastructure practices that provide for the interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration or capture and reuse of stormwater runoff, to provide the maximum amount of stormwater runoff reduction specified in the GSMM, the April 2009 edition of the CSS to the GSMM and the Town of Thunderbolt drainage design criteria; and
B.
Provide adequate documentation to Thunderbolt to show that no additional runoff reducing green infrastructure practices can be used on the development site and that the reduction provided is all that can be provided in a practical manner.
2.
Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated by the designated design storm or storms from a new development or redevelopment site shall be adequately treated before discharge unless otherwise directed by the town manager or his designee. Stormwater management systems should be designed to accomplish the following for each site as a minimum:
A.
Utilize applicable practices in an effort to reduce, at a minimum, the stormwater runoff volume generated by the 0.6 inch rainfall event (and the first 0.6 inches of all larger rainfall events) on the development site;
B.
Capture and treat any of the stormwater runoff generated by the 1.2 inch storm event (and the first 1.2 inches of all larger events) that is not reduced under item 1 above such that:
1.
Eighty percent of the total suspended solids (TSS) loading are removed;
2.
Nitrogen and bacteria loadings are reduced to the maximum extent practicable; and
3.
Stormwater runoff pollutant reduction efforts comply with other watershed-specific, service area-specific or site-specific water quality requirements, if applicable.
It is presumed that a stormwater management system design complies with these criteria if the proposed stormwater controls are selected, designed, constructed and maintained according to GSMM and the CSS. Additional, water quality requirements may be specified for hotspot land uses and activities.
3.
Aquatic resource protection. In order to protect local aquatic resources from several other negative impacts of the land development process, including complete loss or destruction, stream channel enlargement and increased salinity fluctuations, applicants shall provide aquatic resource protection in accordance with the information provided in the April 2009 edition of the CSS to the GSMM.
Aquatic resources protection shall be provided for each site through management and extended detention of the one-year 24-hour storm event released over a period of 24 hours to reduce the frequency and duration of channel forming events.
Velocity control and energy dissipation measures shall be installed at all new and existing stormwater outfalls in accordance with criteria and guidance provided in section 4.5 of the GSMM (volume 2) and applicable sections of the CSS.
4.
Overbank flood protection. All stormwater management systems shall be designed to control the post-development peak discharge generated by the overbank flood protection storm event, as defined in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and any local stormwater design criteria, to prevent an increase in the frequency and magnitude of damaging overbank flooding. A stormwater management system complies with this requirement if it provides overbank flood protection in accordance with the criteria and information provided in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and any local stormwater design criteria.
The town manager or his designee may modify or waive this criteria on development sites where both the on-site and downstream stormwater conveyance systems are designed to safely convey the peak discharge generated by the overbank flood protection storm event to a receiving stream, tidal creek or other aquatic resource without causing additional downstream flooding or other environmental impacts, such as stream channel enlargement or degradation of habitat.
5.
Extreme flood protection. All stormwater management systems shall be designed to control and/or safely convey the post-development peak discharge generated by the extreme flood protection storm event, as defined in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and any local stormwater design criteria, to protect downstream properties from flood damage, maintain the boundaries of existing floodplains, and protect the physical integrity of downstream stormwater conveyance features, management practices, and flood control facilities. A stormwater management system complies with this requirement if it provides extreme flood protection in accordance with the criteria and information provided in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and any local stormwater design criteria.
The town manager or his designee may modify or waive this criteria on development sites where both the on-site and downstream stormwater conveyance systems are designed to safely convey the peak discharge generated by the extreme flood protection storm event to a receiving stream, tidal creek or other aquatic resource without causing additional downstream flooding or other environmental impacts, such as stream channel enlargement or degradation of habitat.
6.
Redevelopment criteria. Land development that qualifies as redevelopment shall meet one of the following criteria:
A.
Reduce impervious cover. Reduce existing site impervious cover by at least 20 percent in an effort to mimic and/or restore the natural hydrology of the site to the maximum extent practical.
B.
Provide stormwater management. Manage the stormwater runoff from at least 20 percent of the site's existing impervious cover and any new impervious cover in accordance with the post-construction stormwater management criteria outlined in subsections (1) through (6) of this section using stormwater management practices designed in accordance with the standards, criteria, and information presented in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and the Local Stormwater Design Manual.
C.
Provide off-site stormwater management. Provide a level of stormwater quality and quantity control that is equal to or greater than that which would be provided by on-site stormwater management practices, in accordance with section 5-321 of this article.
D.
Combination of measures. Any combination of (A) through (C) above that is acceptable to the town manager or his designee.
7.
Structural stormwater management practices. All structural stormwater management practices shall be selected, designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the standards, criteria, and information presented in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and the Local Stormwater Design Manual. Applicants shall consult the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and the Local Stormwater Design Manual for guidance on selecting structural stormwater management practices that can be used to satisfy the post-construction stormwater management criteria.
8.
Nonstructural stormwater management practices. The use of nonstructural stormwater management practices, including better site planning and design techniques, and low impact development practices, is encouraged to preserve and/or replicate the pre-development hydrology of a development or redevelopment site, reduce a site's impact on the watershed, and minimize reliance on structural stormwater management practices. The use of nonstructural stormwater management practices may, at the discretion of the town manager or his designee, allow for a reduction in stormwater runoff volume as a means of complying with the post-construction stormwater management criteria outlined in this section. The nonstructural stormwater management practices that qualify for this credit, and procedures for applying and calculating the runoff reduction provided by these nonstructural stormwater management practices, is provided in the latest edition of the GSMM and the CSS.
9.
Stormwater conveyance systems. Stormwater conveyance systems, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutters, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters, shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining development and redevelopment sites and/or public right-of-ways. Stormwater conveyance systems that are designed to convey stormwater runoff from more than one parcel shall meet the following requirements:
A.
Methods used to calculate stormwater runoff rates and volumes shall be in accordance with the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and the local stormwater design criteria;
B.
All culverts, pipe systems, and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management design plan using the methods included in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and any local stormwater design criteria; and
C.
Planning and design of stormwater conveyance systems shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and any local stormwater design criteria.
Sec. 5-325. - Construction inspection of stormwater management systems.
1.
Notice of construction commencement. The applicant must notify the town manager or his designee before the commencement of construction. In addition, the applicant must notify the town manager or his designee in advance of construction of critical components of the stormwater management practices shown on the approved stormwater management design plan. The town manager or his designee may, at his discretion, issue verbal or written authorization to proceed with critical construction steps, such as installation of permanent stormwater management practices based on stabilization of the drainage area and other factors.
2.
Inspections during construction. Periodic inspections of the stormwater management practices shown on the approved stormwater management design plan shall be conducted by staff or representatives of the director during construction. Construction inspections shall utilize the approved stormwater management design plan for establishing compliance with the provisions of this chapter. All inspections shall be documented in written reports that contain the following information:

ARTICLE V. - TREES

Sec. 5-329. - [Master plan governing tree maintenance, planting, and removal.]
This chapter, along with the Thunderbolt Urban Forest Five-Year Plan and a Standards and Specifications document that outlines requirements for tree care and management, constitute the town's master plan governing tree maintenance, planting, and removal except as set forth in section 5-329. (Adopted 1/09/2013)
A.
Purpose. It is the intention of this chapter to promote the preservation of trees on residential, commercial, and waterfront property and to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare by providing regulations for the planting, maintenance, and removal of trees within the Town of Thunderbolt.
Trees are an integral part of our community and the ecological systems in which the community exists. They provide significant economic, social and ecological benefits. They are as necessary as water, roads, and energy to sustaining healthy communities.
The collection of trees on both public and private properties in a community is called an urban forest. In the urban forest, a single tree may be as important as a patch of forest remnant. To avoid losing this valuable resource, we must set into place, laws to preserve existing trees while we plant and maintain new ones to sustain the urban forest system.
B.
Applicability.
1.
Public property. The Town of Thunderbolt has full power and authority over all trees, plants, and shrubs located within street rights-of-way, parks and public places of the town. No person shall plant, remove, cut above the ground or disturb any tree on any street, park, or public right-of-way without first filing an application and procuring a permit from the town. The person receiving this permit shall abide by the standards set forth in this chapter.
2.
Private property. The Town of Thunderbolt has full power and authority over all trees located on private property that constitute a hazard or a nuisance; and to any tree deemed to be a specimen tree whether on public or private property as described herein. The definition of specimen tree shall be the same as set forth in chapter 5, section 5-329.1D(1) of the town's ordinances. The Town of Thunderbolt has the authority to enter onto private property wherein there is located a tree that is suspected to be a public nuisance or hazard and to order its removal, if necessary. A nuisance or hazard is defined as any tree with an infectious disease, or insect problem or is dead or dying.
C.
Responsibility and authority. There is hereby created and established a Town of Thunderbolt Tree Commission which shall consist of six members—five residents and one supervisory-level/or elected official—appointed by the mayor with the approval of the town council. Members of the board shall serve without compensation. The terms of tree commission appointees shall be three years, except that the terms of two of the members appointed to the first commission shall be for only one year and the terms of two members of the first commission shall be two years. In the event that a vacancy shall occur during the term of any member, his or her successor shall be appointed for the unexpired portion of the term.
It shall be the responsibility of this commission to promulgate the urban forest five-year plan rules, regulations, standards and specifications, for the care, conservation, pruning, planting, replanting, removal or disposition of trees and shrubs in parks, along streets and in other public areas. Such rules, regulations, standards and specifications shall be presented to the mayor and council for approval and adoption and upon adoption shall be considered a part of this chapter.
D.
Tree protection. A tree inventory on public property will be conducted under the supervision of the Thunderbolt Tree Commission. The purpose will be to identify all trees on public lands and to protect trees of historic value or unusual qualities (called specimen trees). In addition to specimen trees as defined in chapter V, section 5-329, a tree may qualify as a specimen tree if it is associated with a historic event or person, or is part of a scenic enhancement.
E.
Permits. Permits are required for all tree removal on public property. This will assure that no entity may damage, prune, or remove a tree from public property in the Town of Thunderbolt, without the written permission of a town designee. Residents are not charged for tree removal permits which may be obtained from the Thunderbolt town offices. Permits are also required for removal or trimming of specimen trees or trees that constitute a nuisance or hazard on private property.
No person except employees of the Town of Thunderbolt or a contractor hired by the town may trim or remove trees protected by this chapter without first obtaining a permit from the town.
F.
Licensing. It shall be unlawful for any contractor to engage, without a permit, in the (1) planting, cutting, trimming, pruning, removing, spraying, or otherwise treating trees, plants or shrubs within the Town of Thunderbolt's parks or rights-of-way or (2) cutting, trimming, or removing specimen trees or trees constituting a hazard or nuisance on private property.
G.
Insurance. Before any permits shall be issued, each applicant shall first file evidence of possession of worker compensation and liability insurance in the minimum amounts of $1,000,000.00 for bodily injury or death and $100,000.00 property damage indemnifying the town or any person injured or damaged resulting from the pursuit of such endeavor as herein described.
H.
Enforcement. The Town of Thunderbolt Code Enforcement Officer or other officer of the town as designated by the town administrator or the mayor and council shall have the power to enforce rules, regulations and terms of this chapter.
I.
Penalties. Any person who violates any provision of this chapter or who fails to comply with any notice issued pursuant to provisions of the ordinance, upon being found guilty of violation, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00 for each offense. Each day during which any violation of the provisions of this chapter shall occur or continue shall be a separate offense. If, as a result of the violation of any provision of this chapter, the injury, mutilation, or death of a tree, shrub, or other plant located on town-owned property is caused, the cost of repair or replacement, or the appraised dollar value of such tree, shrub, or other plant, shall be borne by the party in violation. The value of trees and shrubs shall be determined in accordance with the latest revision of "A Guide to the Professional Evaluation of Landscape Trees, Specimen Shrubs, and Evergreens" as published by the International Society of Arboriculture. All funds collected for violation of the Thunderbolt tree ordinance will be designated solely for the planting of additional trees or shrubs.
J.
Miscellaneous. If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this chapter is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way effect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter.
Note: For the "Standards and Specifications and 5-Year Plan," see the appendix to town ordinances or clerk of council.

Sec. 5-329.1. - Tree protection.
It is the intention of this chapter to promote the preservation of trees as part of the land development and construction process and to promote the preservation of trees on residential, commercial, and waterfront properties.
Trees are recognized for their historical importance as well as in shading, cooling, noise and wind reduction, soil erosion prevention, oxygen production, dust filtration, carbon dioxide absorption, and aesthetic and economic enhancement of all real property. Their contribution to the general well-being and quality of life for the citizens of Thunderbolt is recognized and valued.
Therefore, the town deems it necessary and in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare to enact and enforce an ordinance for the preservation of trees and to prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees and reduction of canopy cover within the town.
A.
Purpose.
(1)
Provide standards for the preservation of trees as part of the land development process;
(2)
Prevent massive grading of land, both developed and undeveloped, without provision for replacement of trees; and
(3)
Protect trees during construction whenever possible in order to enhance the quality of life within the Town of Thunderbolt.
B.
Applicability.
(1)
The terms and provisions of the tree protection ordinance and these standards shall apply to any activity, which requires the issuance of a development permit. No development permit or grading permit shall be issued until it is determined that the proposed development is in conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
(2)
No person shall remove, cause to be removed, poison, damage, trim or transplant any tree with a trunk diameter of six inches or more at breast height without first obtaining a permit, as herein provided.
C.
Exemptions upon review.
(1)
The following shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter:
(a)
The removal of trees, other than specimen trees, from an owner occupied, single-family or duplex lot.
(b)
The necessary removal of trees by a utility company within dedicated utility easements.
(c)
The removal of trees on public rights-of-way conducted by, on behalf of, or for any activity to be dedicated to a federal, state, county, municipal or other government agency in pursuit of its lawful activities or functions in the construction or improvement of public rights-of-way.
(d)
The removal of trees, other than specimen trees, from detention ponds and drainage easements.
(e)
The removal of any tree, which has become or threatens to become a danger to human life or property.
(f)
The removal of trees, other than specimen trees, from recreation areas such as playgrounds, ball fields, etc.
(2)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all reasonable efforts shall be made to save specimen trees.
D.
General criteria for the determination of specimen trees or stands of trees.
(1)
Specimen tree.
(a)
Any tree in fair or better condition, which equals or exceeds the following diameter sizes:
i.
36" dbh (three feet diameter breast height)—Large hardwoods such as oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, sweet gums, etc.
ii.
30" dbh—Large softwoods such as pines, deodar cedars, etc.
iii.
4" dbh—Small trees such as dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.
(b)
A tree in fair or better condition must meet the following minimum standards:
i.
A life expectancy of greater than 15 years.
ii.
A structurally sound trunk.
(c)
A lesser-sized tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is a rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical significance.
(d)
A lesser size tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a landscape project.
(2)
Specimen tree stands. A contiguous grouping of trees, which has been determined to be of high value. Determination is based upon the following criteria:
a.
A relatively mature, even-aged stand.
b.
A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature.
c.
A stand of historical significance.
d.
A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality.
(3)
Critical root zone (CRZ). The area beneath a tree which must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass to give a tree a reasonable chance of survival. The CRZ will typically be represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree's trunk with a radius equal in feet to one and one-half times the number of inches of the trunk diameter. Example: The CRZ radius of a 20-inch diameter tree is 30 feet.
E.
Removal of trees—Conditions and exceptions.
(1)
Tree removal shall be disallowed in the following circumstances:
(a)
Soil erosion or runoff problems will result due to topography, soil type, or proximity to flood plain or river protection areas; and the removal will substantially alter the existing soils adversely with regard to runoff and erosion. Information submitted by the town's public works staff member or other town environmental staff may be used in this evaluation.
(b)
Specimen trees are located on site and cannot be adequately protected or replaced. Additionally, removal may be disallowed if reasonable accommodations can be made to alter the proposed project to save specimen trees and have not been made.
1.
When removal of a specimen tree cannot be avoided, newly planted (two-inch or greater) or additional preserved trees (of a similar type, i.e., hardwood, softwood, small tree) not meeting the size requirement for specimen trees shall be provided in an amount that equals the total inches of removed specimen trees.
(Example: A 36" and a 40" hardwood is proposed for removal. 76" total inches of planted or additional preservation of non-specimen trees shall be required. This could be accomplished by either planting 76" worth of two-inch or greater similar type trees, by preserving 76" of trees of a similar type that are not considered specimen due to being under the size requirement, or a combination of planting and additional tree preservation.)
(c)
Property degradation. The removal will have a significant adverse effect on property values of any adjoining property.
(d)
Pruning. Any substantial amount of pruning which results in unsightly appearance or predisposing the tree to pathogens, reducing the health and vigor of the tree.
(2)
Exceptions. Tree removal from a site may be allowed if:
(a)
The tree is located in an area where a structure or improvement will be placed and the tree cannot be relocated on the site because of age, type or size of tree.
(b)
The tree is diseased or structurally unsound.
(c)
The tree is injured and/or poses an imminent danger.
(d)
The tree interferes with existing utility service.
(e)
The tree creates an unsafe vision clearance for vehicular movement.
(3)
Trees must be relocated or replaced on site in accordance with the provisions of the Thunderbolt zoning ordinance. Prior to approval of the tree protection plan, the arborist shall require relocation or replacement of each tree being moved or removed on the site to be supplemented with additional trees to establish within the tree protection zone a minimum of one tree per 500 square feet of minimum required open space.
(4)
Existing trees. Any existing trees of not less than two inches dbh left in good growing condition on the property shall be counted toward the minimum number required. All replacement trees will be maintained properly to ensure their survivability.
(5)
Debris removed. All debris from trees cut or substantially damaged shall be removed from the site in a timely fashion, including the removal of any portion of the tree stump above the original natural grade or elevation of land, unless accepted by the arborist for a specific reason such as, but not limited to, unusually large size or age.
(6)
It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable effort shall include, but not be limited to, alteration of building design; alternate location of building, parking area, water retention drainage pipes; or relocation of utilities.
F.
Breach of ordinance. Any person(s) who violate any provision of this chapter or who fails to comply with any notice issued may be subject to legal prosecution resulting in a maximum fine of:
$200.00 First offense.
$300.00 Second offense.
$500.00 Third offense.
