ARTICLE 17A. - VN VILLAGE NODE DISTRICT

Sec. 1701A. - Purpose.
The VN district is established to provide development design criteria and standards for comprehensive and coordinated development of areas identified on the Spalding County Future Land Use Map (a part of the Spalding County Comprehensive Plan) as being appropriate for greater residential densities and mixed-use development. The VN district encourages flexible site plans and building arrangements under a unified plan of development for retail, commercial and service uses for self-sufficient neighborhoods and to encourage and develop a sense of community. The VN district is established to provide a variety of residential development styles and community commercial services.
The VN district encourages development of residences in areas surrounding and adjoining commercial property. The residential areas will consist of quality housing constructed in compliance with high construction standards which focus on aesthetic appearance and co-existence with nearby commercial property. The VN district will encourage development of flex (live/work) units which consist of multi-storied structures with commercial uses and/or living space. The commercial area within the VN district shall be composed principally of neighborhood and community related commercial uses requiring less than thirty thousand (30,000) square feet. The commercial area must be developed in a manner consistent with adjoining residential properties.
The VN district encourages pedestrian access to commercial properties from residences. Retail centers shall be designed to provide pedestrian access from all areas of the village. The development benefits from better land utilization in the provision of roads, utilities, other infrastructure and overall site design. The VN district must have direct ingress and egress from a state highway or a county collector street. All property within the VN district must be served by public water and sewer.
