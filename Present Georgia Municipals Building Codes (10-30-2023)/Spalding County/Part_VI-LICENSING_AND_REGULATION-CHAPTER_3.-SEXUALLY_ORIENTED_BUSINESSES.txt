Sec. 6-3001. - Findings and public purpose.
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas, Daytona, Florida, Gwinnett County, Georgia, and Garden Grove, California, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by Spalding County, Georgia; and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented at the board of commissioners' hearing on August 14, 2007, and based upon the holdings and evidence of the harmful secondary effects caused by sexually oriented businesses described in prior judicial opinions such as City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002), City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000); 44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484 (1996); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452 U.S. 714 (1981), Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976); California v. Larue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); Daytona Grand, Inc. v. City of Daytona Beach, Fla., 490 F.3d 860 (11 th Cir. 2007); Zibtluda, LLC v. Gwinnett County, 411 F.3d 1278 (11 th Cir. 2007); Peek-A-Boo Lounge of Bradenton, Inc. v. Manatee County, Fla., 337 F.3d 1251 (11th Cir. 2003); Sammy's of Mobile, Ltd. v. City of Mobile, 140 F.3d 993 (11th Cir. 1998), the Spalding County Board of Commissioners takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country.
It is the finding of the Board of Commissioners of Spalding County that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community.
Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described. The board of commissioners finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in Spalding County, as well.
Furthermore, it is the finding of the Spalding County Board of Commissioners that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities.
The Board of Commissioners of Spalding County, Georgia, therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's daycare facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of sexually oriented businesses, also commonly referred to as adult entertainment establishments.
Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Spalding County finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The board finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this chapter is hereby adopted.
