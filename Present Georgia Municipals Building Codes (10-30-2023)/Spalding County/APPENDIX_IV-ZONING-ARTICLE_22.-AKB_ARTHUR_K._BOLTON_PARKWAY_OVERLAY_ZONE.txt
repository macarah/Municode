ARTICLE 22. - AKB ARTHUR K. BOLTON PARKWAY OVERLAY ZONE

Sec. 2201. - Purpose.
AKB is an overlay zone which governs the development of property located along the Arthur K. Bolton Parkway (Georgia Highway 16 East) from approximately the eastern boundary of the city limits of the City of Griffin, Georgia, to the Spalding County line with Butts County. This overlay zone applies additional development standards to the area contained within the overlay zone. The purpose of this overlay zone is to develop standards and criteria for development of property within the zone in a comprehensive, planned manner creating a residential, business and manufacturing corporate campus development environment and to prevent piece-meal development along the Arthur K. Bolton Parkway in a manner which would deter the ease of flow of traffic from the City of Griffin to Interstate 75. Additionally, the overlay zone is designed to create an attractive and functional entryway from Interstate 75 through eastern Spalding County to the City of Griffin. To establish this environment, entry and exit points along the Arthur K. Bolton Parkway shall be limited, and strict adherence to aesthetic development criteria including buffers, greenbelts, landscaping and signage restrictions shall be required.
It is the express legislative intent of this overlay district that strip or single lot commercial development will undermine the objective sought through the adoption and implementation of this ordinance. While this ordinance seeks to confer additional rights without depriving any property of its existing rights, the passage of this ordinance should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the traditional commercial zoning which it seeks to avoid.
(Res. of 6-5-98, § 1)

Bolton Parkway at a distance of seven hundred fifty (750) feet from such northern right-of-way; and on the south by a line extending eastward from the city limits of the City of Griffin, Georgia, to the Spalding County boundary with Butts County, running parallel to the southern right-of-way of Arthur K. Bolton Parkway at a distance of seven hundred fifty (750) feet from such southern right-of-way.
