ARTICLE 22D. - NORTH EXPRESSWAY IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT OVERLAY (NEID)

Sec. 2201D. - Purpose.
The North Expressway Improvement District (NEID) is an overlay zone which governs the development of property located along the U.S. Highway 19/41 corridor from the Henry-Spalding County line to the north boundary of the city limits of the City of Griffin, Georgia. This zone applies additional development standards to the area contained within the overlay zone. The purpose of this overlay zone is to develop standards and criteria for the orderly development of property located within its boundaries in a comprehensive, planned manner creating a quality business and residential development environment, to prevent piece-meal development along the U.S. Highway 19/41 and to improve the aesthetic appeal and quality of development located therein. The NEID overlay zone is designed to create an attractive and functional entryway along U.S. Highway 19/41 through northern Spalding County to the City of Griffin.
The area within the NEID overlay zone has developed without comprehensive planning for more than fifty (50) years. Its current appearance evidences the negative impacts of piece meal, uncontrolled and unattractive development. The presence of this development has been a detriment to new, better quality of developments along U.S. Highway 19/41. The development standards required herein protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public to achieve the purposes and goals stated herein. To promote the improvement of the quality of development along the U.S. Highway 19/41 corridor, strict adherence to aesthetic development criteria including buffers, greenbelts, landscaping and signage restrictions shall be required.
It is the express legislative intent of the NEID overlay that further strip or single lot commercial development will undermine the objectives sought through the adoption and implementation of this ordinance [article]. The NEID overlay is intended to improve the quality of development along U.S. Highway 19/41 by enhancing the economic and aesthetic appeal of the U.S. Highway 19/41 corridor and promoting the orderly development of properties therein. The NEID overlay is also intended to reduce harmful effects resulting from heat, noise, traffic congestion and glare. The development requirements within the NEID overlay are intended to reduce traffic congestion and visual clutter often associated with development along a major thoroughfare, using required buffer and landscaped areas, limitations on ingress and egress to individual parcels, restrictions on lighting, outdoor storage and impervious areas.

A.
Mixed-use development means a style of development that blends residential, commercial, cultural, institutional, or entertainment uses into one space, where those functions are to some degree physically and functionally integrated, and that provides pedestrian connections. Mixed-use development may be applied to a single building, a block or neighborhood. These projects may be completed by a private developer, a governmental agency, a quasi-governmental agency or a combination thereof. A mixed-use development may be new construction, reuse of an existing building or brownfield site, or a combination thereof.
B.
Planned development means a development for which a master development plan must be approved prior to the issuance of any development permit. Each development permit issued shall be conditioned upon compliance with the required master development plan. If rezoning is required for any development, whether single-family residential, condominium, commercial, or mixed use, rezoning approval shall be conditioned upon compliance with the required master development plan. The master development plan shall identify the tract of land for the proposed development, the nature of the proposed development, public streets, common areas and open space, aesthetic amenities, landscaping, public facilities and restrictive covenants relating to the development.
