Sec. 2-1-7. - Rules of procedure and decorum.
The following rules of procedure and decorum are hereby adopted to be applicable to all regular and special meetings of the city's governing body:
(1)
Getting the floor.
(a)
Each member of the governing body shall have a right to speak and address any matter or issue before the governing body, for up to a total initial time limit of three (3) minutes per matter or issue. However, when a member of the governing body wishes to make a motion or speak during a discussion or debate, he or she must first be recognized by the presiding officer in order to speak. Council members are not permitted to call out or interrupt another speaker. The order in which members of the governing body are to be recognized for the purpose of addressing or speaking to any particular issue or subject matter shall be determined by the presiding officer in his or her discretion, provided that the presiding officer shall not be entitled to prohibit a member of the governing body from speaking regarding each issue or matter under discussion, for up to a total of three minutes for each issue or matter. The only manner in which any member of the governing body may be recognized by the presiding officer for the purpose of speaking during a meeting is to first raise a hand and be recognized by the presiding officer, in accordance with this subsection.
(b)
When making remarks at a meeting, each member of the governing body shall confine his or her remarks to the topic being discussed or debated, and shall avoid personal attacks upon other members of the governing body or upon the motives or character of other members.
(c)
After all members of the governing body who wish to speak on a single topic have been allowed to speak, then the presiding officer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to allow a member of the governing body to speak a second time on the subject or topic being discussed, for up to a total of two (2) additional minutes for each topic or subject being discussed.
(d)
A second is required for any motion to assure minimum support for the motion.
(e)
When a second is not forthcoming, the motion will "die for lack of a second," and the presiding officer shall so announce. Then the next order of business will be taken up without further debate or discussion.
(f)
The presiding officer has the right to rule remarks or comments out of order and thereby terminate them, if a council member has already made essentially the same point, or if the council member is repeating something he or she has already stated. The purpose of this rule is to avoid redundancies and repeating the same point more than once, and to avoid wasting time during debate and discussion.
(g)
No council member shall be allowed to speak on any one (1) topic for more than a total of five (5) minutes during any single meeting.
(2)
Decorum during meetings.
(a)
All requests for recognition by the presiding officer must be done by first raising a hand and waiting for the presiding officer to recognize the council member in order to begin speaking. Except for raising a "point of order," at no time shall any council member be allowed to interrupt the presiding officer if he or she is speaking, for any purpose.
(b)
All comments of any council member shall be addressed to the presiding officer or to the general public in attendance at the meeting; provided however that it shall be the privilege of a council member to ask any question to the city manager, any city staff person or the city attorneys.
(c)
No council member shall be permitted to make rude, obnoxious, slanderous, or personal attacks on anyone, including but not limited to any other member of council or the presiding officer. All council members shall also refrain from side discussions or other distractions during a meeting.
(3)
Point of inquiry.
(a)
A member of the city council may raise a "point of inquiry" if a simple clarification of a motion (a motion that is already before the council for consideration) is needed. This should be done by raising a hand and stating to the presiding officer, "point of inquiry," and at that time the presiding officer may in his or her discretion, recognize the council member by stating "state your point."
(b)
Points of inquiry are used sparingly and only in case of honest confusion as to the intent or meaning of a then pending motion. A point of inquiry may not be used to simply add to the debate or discussion.
(c)
Clarification cannot take longer than three (3) minutes.
(4)
Point of order.
(a)
A council member may interrupt a speaker in order to raise a "point of order," if the council member reasonably believes a meeting is being conducted in a manner inconsistent with these rules or Robert's Rules of Order.
(b)
If a point of order is properly raised by the council member being recognized by the presiding officer to speak, then the council member who was speaking will upon request of the presiding officer yield the floor for the limited purpose of hearing the point of order.
(c)
The mayor would then say "state your point".
(5)
Public comments.
(a)
Public comments will be allowed only during the "public comments" period of each regular meeting of the governing body at the time shown on the agenda. Members of the public are not allowed to participate in any debate or discussion being conducted by the members of the governing body.
(b)
Public comments will be limited in time to a total of three (3) minutes per speaker, and a total time limit at any one (1) meeting of twenty-one (21) minutes. If more than seven (7) potential speakers sign up to make public comments, then the total amount of time permitted for each individual speaker will be reduced by an announcement of the presiding officer, so as to limit the total time to twenty-one (21) minutes. The governing body, by majority vote, may allow extensions of time for individuals in order to allow such individuals to finish their comments.
(c)
No person may sign up more than once in an effort to gain more time for a public comment.
(d)
Public comments during a meeting of the city governing body will only be allowed to residents of the City of Forest Park or to owners of businesses maintaining a business site physically situated within the corporate limits of the City of Forest Park.
(e)
Persons not residing within the City of Forest Park who do not own a business as specified in subsection (d) above who wish to address the governing body during any regular meeting must first request that they be placed on the agenda for the upcoming regular meeting, such request to be made in writing by close of business at city hall on the Wednesday immediately preceding the regular meeting at which they wish to speak.
(f)
All public comments must be limited to matters on the agenda or over which the governing body has jurisdiction.
(g)
Nonresidents who do not own a business as specified in subsection (d) above will also be limited to three (3) minutes per speaker, and a total of fifteen (15) minutes for an entire group of speakers at any single meeting, whether they are speaking on the same topic or not. If more than five (5) potential nonresident speakers are placed on the agenda in order to address the governing body, the time permitted for each individual speaker shall be reduced so as to limit the total time for speaking for such nonresidents to fifteen (15) minutes at any one (1) meeting.
(6)
Addressing the city council and citizens.
(a)
Speakers may raise any point of concern regarding any matter on the agenda or any matter over which the governing body has jurisdiction, but each speaker must maintain a decorous demeanor and refrain from personal attacks upon members of the governing body, shouting and using obscene language.
(b)
The presiding officer may interrupt and take the floor away from individuals who violate subsection (a) above.
(c)
Comments which are redundant or repetitive from previous statements made in the same meeting may be ruled out of order and terminated by the presiding officer.
(7)
Removal for violation of these rules. Any council member who violates these rules must first be orally warned by the presiding officer, and if the council member then interrupts another speaker or speaks out without being recognized, or violates these rules in any other way for a second time in a single meeting, then the presiding officer may ask the sergeant at arms (a sworn City of Forest Park Police Officer) to remove the offending council member from the city council chambers for the remainder of the meeting.
(8)
Purpose of these rules. It is not the intent of these rules to in any way hinder or impair the full and free expression of all competing viewpoints in discussions and debates. Instead it is the intent of this section to foster confidence in government through encouraging civil and respectful meetings. The failure to strictly observe these rules and procedures shall not affect the jurisdiction of the governing body and shall not be deemed to in any way invalidate or impair the legal validity and effect of official action taken by the governing body at any meeting that is otherwise held and conducted in accordance with law.
