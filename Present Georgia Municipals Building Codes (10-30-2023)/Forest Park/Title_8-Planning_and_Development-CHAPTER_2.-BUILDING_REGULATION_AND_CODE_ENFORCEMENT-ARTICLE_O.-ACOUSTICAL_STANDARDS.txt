Sec. 8-2-143. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this article, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
(1)
Airport means any public use airport, including heliports, as defined by the ASNA Act, including: (a) Any airport which is used or to be used for public purposes, under the control of a public agency, the landing area of which is publicly owned; (b) any privately owned reliever airport; and (c) any privately owned airport which is determined by the Secretary to enplane annually two thousand five hundred (2,500) or more passengers and receive scheduled passenger service of aircraft, which is used or to be used for public purposes.
(2)
Airport noise compatibility program and program means that program, and all revisions thereto, reflected in documents (and revised documents) developed in accordance with 14 CFR Part 150, et. seq. including the measures proposed or taken by the airport operator to reduce existing noncompatible land uses and to prevent the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses within the area.
(3)
Background sound level means the total sound pressure level in the area of interest excluding the noise source of interest.
(4)
Commercial area means a group of commercial facilities and the abutting public right-of-way and public property.

b.
Dining establishments;
c.
Establishments for providing retail or wholesale services;
d.
Establishments for recreation and entertainment;
e.
Office buildings;
f.
Transportation; and
g.
Warehouses.
(6)
Compatible use means suitable relative to a specific context, i.e., compatible with a residential neighborhood, compatible with a business district, or, in the case of proximity to an airport, compatible with an environment that has aircraft noise exposure.
(7)

(8)
Daytime hours mean the hours between 7:01 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
(9)
Decibel (dB) means the unit of measurement for a sound pressure level and is equal to ten (10) times the common logarithm of the ratio of two (2) like quantities (see "sound pressure level").
(10)
DNL (day-night average sound level) is a noise metric, a single-number descriptor, that accounts for the magnitude and duration of single noise events, the frequency of occurrence of single noise events, and the time—day or night—of single noise events. It is a weighted energy average. Each single event occurring between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. has a ten (10) dB penalty added to it; each one (1) event is effectively counted as ten (10) events of equal magnitude and duration.
(11)
Equivalent sound level (Leq) means the non-varying sound level that would contain the equivalent amount of energy as a varying sound level. Note that Leq can be weighted or unweighted and can be integrated over durations ranging from less than a second to many hours. The notation should indicate weighting used and duration, e.g., 85 dBA Leq (six min.) is an A-weighted 85 decibel equivalent sound level, integrated over a six-minute period.

(19)
Noise means any sound of such level and duration as to be or tend to be injurious to human health or welfare, or which would unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of life or property throughout the city or in any portions thereof, but excludes all aspects of the employer-employee relationship concerning health and safety hazard within the confines of a place of employment.
(20)
Noise disturbance means any sound that endangers the health, safety or welfare of any person, is detrimental to the peaceful enjoyment of private property, or endangers personal or real property.
(21)
Noise exposure map means a scaled, geographic depiction of an airport, its noise contours, and surrounding area developed in accordance with section A150.101 of Appendix A of FAR 150, including the accompanying documentation setting forth the required descriptions of forecast aircraft operations at that airport during the fifth calendar year beginning after submission of the map, together with the ways, if any, those operations will affect the map (including noise contours and the forecast land uses).
(22)
Noise level reduction (NLR) means the amount of noise level reduction in decibels achieved through incorporation of noise attenuation (between outdoor and indoor levels) in the design and construction of a structure.
(23)
Noncompatible land use means the use of land that is identified under this part as normally not compatible with the outdoor noise environment (or an adequately attenuated noise reduction level for the indoor activities involved at the location) because the yearly day-night average sound level is above that identified for that or similar use under Appendix A (Table 1) of FAR 150.
