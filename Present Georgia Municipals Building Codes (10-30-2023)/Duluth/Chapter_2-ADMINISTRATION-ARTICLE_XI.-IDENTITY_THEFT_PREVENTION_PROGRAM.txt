ARTICLE XI. - IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM

Sec. 2-250. - Findings.
The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") requires a broad category of creditors to implement an identity theft prevention program ("ITPP"). The FTC requirement and regulation is necessary because of section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ("FACT Act"). The FTC has set forth the ITPP requirement in 16 C.F.R. § 681.2. Identity theft is defined as a fraud committed or attempted using identifying information of another person without authority. The city adopts the program set forth in this section to comply with FTC rules and regulations. In drafting its ITPP, the city has considered:
(1)
The methods it provides to open its accounts;
(2)
The methods it provides to access its accounts; and
(3)
Its previous experiences with identity theft.
Based on these considerations, the governing authority of the city hereby determines that the city is a low to moderate risk entity and as a result develops and implements the streamlined ITPP set forth in this section.
