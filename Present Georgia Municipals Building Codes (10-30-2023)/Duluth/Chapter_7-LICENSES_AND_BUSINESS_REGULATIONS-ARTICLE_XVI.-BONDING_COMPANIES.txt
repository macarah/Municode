ARTICLE XVI. - BONDING COMPANIES

Sec. 7-711. - Authority to operate bonding company.
(a)
Any and all entities wishing to engage in the bonding business in the city for those cases within the jurisdiction of the municipal court of the city shall obtain a certificate of authority ("certificate"). All employees of those entities holding certificates who are professional bondspersons and who write bonds shall obtain a professional bondsperson permit ("permit").
(b)
An entity wishing to engage in the bonding business in the city ("bonding company") can be an individual, trust, a group of individuals, whether or not formed as a partnership or other legal entity, a corporation or a combination of individuals, trusts and corporations. A bonding company can consist solely of a professional bondsperson; however, when a professional bondsperson comprises the entire personnel and payroll of the bonding company, said professional bondsperson must secure both a certificate and a permit.
(c)
A certificate is renewable annually unless the bonding company or an employee has defaulted under this article; ceases to be in good standing; has violated other general federal, or state laws applicable to either the bonding company or to any individual involved with the bonding company or the bonding business itself; or has violated any ordinance of the city.
(d)
Within the context of these requirements and as defined by state law, a "professional bondsperson" is one who holds him or herself out as a signer of surety of bonds for compensation and meets the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 17-6-50. No professional bondsperson or agent thereof may visit prisoners or sign bonds for any person imprisoned unless the bonding company has procured a certificate of authority and the professional bondsperson or agent thereof has obtained a professional bondsperson permit ("permit"). This permit shall be in the form of an identification card. The requirements contained in this article shall in no way lessen the requirements placed upon professional bondspersons under state law. A professional bondsperson shall not be authorized to directly write bonds in the municipal court of the city at any time while the bonding company which employs him or her is not certified due to the suspension or revocation of the certificate, or while the professional bondsperson's permit is suspended or revoked.
(e)
All certificates must be prominently displayed in the business location of the bonding company. All professional bondspersons transacting bonding business in the city must wear in a location visible to the public a professional bondsperson identification card (permit).
(f)
All certificate applications must be accompanied by a non refundable filing fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) to cover costs of investigation. All professional bondsperson permit applications must be accompanied by a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each person required to submit a professional bondsperson permit application. Each renewal application and all additional professional bondsperson applications must be accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) each. Each bonding company shall pay a regulatory fee of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) in addition to occupation taxes and other taxes and fees, where applicable.
(g)
The term "professional bondsperson" shall be deemed to include the term "bondsman."
(h)
Certificates of authority and professional bondsperson permits/identification cards are nontransferable.
