(3)
Decorum; compliance with rules.

(4)
Public hearings. The board of commissioners may schedule public hearings for the purpose of soliciting public comment on any subject of interest to the board of commissioners.

(Code 2003, § 2-71)
Sec. 2-74. - Parliamentarian.
The county attorney shall serve as the parliamentarian for board of commissioners meetings.
(Code 2003, § 2-72)
Sec. 2-75. - Main motion.
In order for the board of commissioners to take any official action on any subject, a commissioner must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chairperson until another commissioner agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the commissioner seconding the motion to support the motion. A commissioner may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the board of commissioners has voted on that motion.
(Code 2003, § 2-73)
Sec. 2-76. - Debate.
(a)
After a main motion, as described in section 2-75, is recognized by the chairperson, the board of commissioners shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the chairperson in a manner that is fair to all members of the board of commissioners. Commissioners may participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the chairperson.
(b)
During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the board of commissioners take a particular action on a motion. There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated.
(c)
Commissioners may also introduce privileged motions. Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions.
(Code 2003, § 2-74)
Sec. 2-77. - Voting; procedure.
modified
Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways:
a.
If debate has been completed and no other commissioner wishes to speak, the chairperson can call for the vote. If there are no objections then, the chairperson can proceed with the vote;
b.
If the chairperson calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the board of commissioners may move to vote immediately ("move the previous question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by a two-thirds vote, debate will stop. The chairperson will then read the proposed motion to the board of commissioners and ask for the votes of the commissioners.
(2)
Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chairperson. The chairperson shall read the proposed motion to the board of commissioners and then call for the vote.
(Code 2003, § 2-75)
Sec. 2-78. - Ranking of motions.
(a)
Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the board of commissioners returns to consider the motion of lower precedence.
(b)
A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list:
(1)
Main motion (lowest rank).
(2)
Subsidiary motions (debatable):
a.
Postpone indefinitely.
b.
Amend.
c.
Refer to committee (commit).
d.
Postpone to a certain time (postpone definitely).
(3)
Subsidiary motions (undebatable):
a.

c.
Lay on the table (postpone temporarily).
(4)
Privileged motions (undebatable):
a.
Question of privilege.
b.
Recess.
c.
Adjourn (highest rank).
(Code 2003, § 2-76)
Sec. 2-79. - Subsidiary motions.
modified
During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce motions that propose that the board of commissioners take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow the board of commissioners to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions: amend, limit debate and vote immediately, also may apply to other subsidiary motions.
(1)
Postpone indefinitely. If a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered by the board of commissioners, that commissioner may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A motion to postpone indefinitely may be debated, but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(2)
Amend. If a commissioner believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion.
a.
Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend.
b.
Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a certain time and the motion to recess can also be amended.
c.
A motion cannot be amended more than two times.
d.
Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable.
e.
A majority vote is required for the board of commissioners to adopt an amendment.
f.
If the amendment is adopted, then the board of commissioners shall consider the amended version of the motion.
(3)
Refer to a committee (commit). If a commissioner believes that further information is needed before the board of commissioners can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the board of commissioners. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(4)
Postpone to a certain time (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the chairperson will bring the original motion back to the board of commissioners for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(5)
Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the commissioner who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion and a two-thirds vote is required.
(6)
Vote immediately (previous question). If a commissioner believes that the motion being considered should be voted on, the commissioner may move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable and a vote of two-thirds of the board of commissioners is required for the motion to pass.
(7)
Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the board of commissioners during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(Code 2003, § 2-77)
Sec. 2-80. - Privileged motions.
modified
Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions.
(1)
Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chairperson concerning the rights of a commissioner or of the board of commissioners as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chair is required to make a ruling on the question.
(2)
Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(3)
Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a commissioner must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(Code 2003, § 2-78)
Sec. 2-81. - Incidental motions.
modified
Incidental motions allow commissioners to exert their rights as a member of the board of commissioners. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting.
(1)
Appeal. If a commissioner disagrees with a decision that is made by the chairperson, that commissioner may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the board of commissioners. The chairperson has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The board of commissioners may then debate the appeal. The board of commissioners shall decide by majority vote if the chairperson's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table.
(2)
Parliamentary inquiry. If a commissioner has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chairperson to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the board of commissioners. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable.
(3)
Point of order (question of order). If a commissioner believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairperson can make a ruling on the question or can allow the board of commissioners to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table.
(4)
Point of information (request for information). If a commissioner has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chairperson and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable.
(Code 2003, § 2-79)
Sec. 2-82. - Supplementary main motions.
modified
Three motions allow the board of commissioners to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the board of commissioners. The following motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the following ways specified:
(1)
Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the board of commissioners to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the board of commissioners to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any commissioner may make a motion to reconsider and any commissioner may second the motion. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the board of commissioners is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the board of commissioners will return to debate and revote the original motion.
(2)
Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the board of commissioners overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any commissioner. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the commissioner seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-34. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, then the board of commissioners shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided.
(3)
Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the board of commissioners to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

(b)
Purchases contrary to the method provided in subsection (a) of this section shall be deemed unauthorized purchases. The county will not be responsible for the payment of any bills submitted for unauthorized purchases. It shall be considered a breach of duty on the part of any officer or employee of the county to make any purchase, or aid and abet the making of any purchase in any other manner than through the purchasing office; provided, however, that this section shall not apply to the provision of medical services for prisoners under the care of the sheriff's department or emergency purchases as provided in section 2-218.

(a)
Emergency purchases are those purchases made necessary by situations which could not be anticipated by the department or elected official, usually involving life threatening circumstances or risks of injury, or resulting in work stoppages, undue delay or occurring during non-business hours when the ordinary purchase procedures cannot be followed. Negligence on the part of the department head or elected official to plan properly is not justification of an emergency purchase.
(b)
If an emergency requiring a purchase occurs during business hours, the department head or elected official shall contact the purchasing office and obtain an emergency purchase order number. The item sought may then be acquired using that number. Such number will be stated to the vendor as evidence that the purchase has been approved and the number shall be noted on any vendor invoice for the item receiving emergency approval. If the emergency occurs during non-business hours, the department head or elected official may make the purchase and, immediately upon the resolution of the emergency, a requisition shall be prepared stating the nature of the emergency. The requisition shall be forwarded to the purchase office on the next business day. The requisition shall be accompanied by the purchase receipt and a memorandum from the department head or elected official setting forth the details of the emergency.

modified
Where practicable, all county purchases and contract work shall be subject to fair and open bidding subject to state law, county ordinance and the following:
(1)
State contract prices. Items that can be purchased from a published list of bid prices provided by the state or its agencies may be purchased in accordance with such bid list and contract price without bids subject to the accrual of revenue and availability of funds which shall be confirmed and coordinated with the board of commissioners prior to purchase.
(2)
Small purchases. Small purchases of less than $250.00 may be made from suppliers and distributors in the ordinary course of business when such purchases are generally sold on a competitive basis. When several small purchases can be reasonably combined for non-monthly recurring purchases, then consideration shall be given to a pooled or bulk purchase subject to the bidding process.
(3)
Special or custom items. Items of a specialized, unique or customized nature or origin, without more than one distributor in the county area, may be purchased at a price published in catalogues or trade journals or commonly known in the field of use provided that if the value of such item exceeds $2,500.00 in cost, then the board of commissioners may require advertisement of such purchase.
(4)
Purchases between $250.00 and $2,500.00. For items sold by more than one distributor, at least two sources shall be contacted and a cost estimate obtained from each of the items costing up to $2,500.00.
(5)
Purchases between $2,500.00 and $10,000.00. All purchases and contracts having an estimated cost between $2,500.00 and $10,000.00 may be subject to bids with at least two suppliers or contractors submitting bids in writing except as follows:
a.
Bulk gas purchases may be subject to oral solicitation on a regular monthly basis provided the bidders and amounts of bids are noted in writing.
b.
Items covered by other provisions of this division or law.
c.
Where otherwise requested by the board of commissioners.
(6)
Purchases and contracts over $10,000.00. Unless otherwise provided in this division, all purchases and contracts estimated to cost $10,000.00 or more, except public works contracts and materials, may be subject to a written sealed bid after advertisement in the official organ of the county at least 15 days prior to the bid opening date. Subject to prior notice and approval by the board of commissioners, used equipment and property may be purchased, without advertisement, provided that the department head has made a diligent search of the marketplace and provides documentation of such search. Documentation shall include information as to the cost of such equipment if new, its availability, warranty, expected life, proposed use, etc.
(7)
Bulk purchases. When items to be purchased are also used by other county departments and can be reasonably purchased in bulk with other county departments, then such departments shall coordinate such purchases with each other and with the purchasing office to promote the most economical purchase price and to minimize the number of transactions involved.
(8)
Inventory. All purchases resulting in a fixed asset (vehicle, equipment, furnishings, etc.) with a value of over $500.00 shall be properly inventoried and documented by the department head. The department head shall be responsible for affixing the bar code sticker to the fixed asset. Each department head shall review the department's inventory for additions and deletions.
(9)
Local vendors. Except for matters required to be bid by state law, including, without limitation, public works contracts and materials, any purchase or contract of under $100,000.00 that is put out to bid under the provisions of this division shall be awarded to a local vendor in the case of equivalent bids. In cases in which a bid by a local vendor is within five percent of the lowest overall bid supplied by a non-local vendor, the administration of the county is authorized to negotiate with such local bidder to match the lowest bid supplied by a non-local vendor. Negotiation is limited to purchases and contracts up to $100,000.00 and is not authorized in situations where state or federal laws do not allow vendor preferences. If a local bidder matches the lowest bid, including all other terms and conditions of the bid, then the local vendor will be awarded the contract. If the bids of more than one local vendor are within five percent of the lowest overall bid of a non-local vendor, the local vendor with the lowest bid price will be given the first opportunity to match the lowest overall bid. If this local vendor declines to match such bid, then the vendor with the next lowest bid within five percent will be given the opportunity to match the lowest bid. This process will continue with all local vendors having bids within five percent of the lowest overall bid by a non-local vendor.
(10)
Indebted vendors. No bid shall be accepted nor any purchase made through any local or non-local vendor which owes real or personal, state, county, or school district ad valorem taxes to the county at the time of such sale.
(Code 2003, § 2-217)
