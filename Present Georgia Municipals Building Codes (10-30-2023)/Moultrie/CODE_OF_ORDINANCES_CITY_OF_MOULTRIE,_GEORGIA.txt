PREFACE
Part I of this volume contains the Charter and Related Laws of the City of Moultrie, Georgia, as amended, and a comparative table setting forth in chronological sequence the disposition of each act amending or relating to the Charter of the City, whether or not included in this publication. Part II contains a revision and codification of the ordinances, resolutions and motions of a general and permanent nature of the City of Moultrie, which were deemed appropriate to be included.
Part II is an entire new codification, and, as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. Only those ordinances, resolutions or motions of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole are included herein. Special ordinances, resolutions or motions dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as those levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, rezoning certain designated districts, etc., are not included herein. For a more specific enumeration of the type of ordinances which are not included herein see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance.
The material in Part II, Code, has been classified as to subject matter. As will be noted, the chapters have been arranged conveniently in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Attention is also invited to the footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant provisions of general state law.
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5 or new chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

  Indexes
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
