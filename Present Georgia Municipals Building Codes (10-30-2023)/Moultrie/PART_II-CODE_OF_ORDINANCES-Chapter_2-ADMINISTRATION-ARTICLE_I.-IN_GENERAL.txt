(b)
Exemptions. The city council may exempt buildings or other structures from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section where it finds that the addition of fallout protection will create, in the building or other structure, an additional net cost in excess of three percent in the construction of such building or that other factors make it unnecessary or impracticable to incorporate fallout protection in the design or construction of such building or structure.

Purpose of requirements. It shall be the policy of the city council that fallout shelter protection shall be incorporated into all city buildings or structures to the fullest extent practicable in order to provide protection against the effect of radioactive fallout for the greatest possible number of people in the event of nuclear attack upon the United States or an accidental nuclear explosion.
