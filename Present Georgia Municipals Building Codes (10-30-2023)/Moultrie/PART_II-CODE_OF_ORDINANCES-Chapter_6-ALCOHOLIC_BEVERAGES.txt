(b)
Notice; hearing. Any license which has been issued or which may be issued by the city to any licensee may be suspended or revoked by the city manager for due cause. Before the city manager shall revoke or suspend any existing license, the applicant shall be given notice in writing from the city manager or his designee addressed to the licensee to the most recent address contained on the original application, renewal application, as supplemented in writing by the licensee, and to the address of licensed location to show cause before the city manager at a time and place specified therein, not less than five days nor more than 15 days from the date of the notice, why the license should not be revoked or suspended, as the case may be, stating the grounds therefore, and at the appointed time and place the licensee shall have the opportunity to show cause, if any exists, the license revoked or suspended, after which the city manager shall take such action as he/she, in his judgment and discretion, shall deem warranted under the facts, including suspension or revocation, and may impose a fine as currently set or hereafter set by resolution by city council. All decisions suspending or revoking any license shall be in writing, with the reason therefore stated, and mailed or delivered to the applicant. In addition, at any hearing as provided herein, the party afforded the hearing shall have the opportunity to present evidence, have an attorney, and have testimony recorded at his expense.
(c)
Due cause generally.
(1)
Due cause for the suspension or revocation of any license shall consist of an act of omission found to be by the city manager, after a hearing as above provided, a violation of any law or ordinance regulating such business, or violation of regulations made pursuant to authority granted for the purpose of regulating such business, of for the violation of any state or federal law, or for the violation of any city ordinance, other than minor traffic violations, or failure of the licensee or his employee to promptly report to the police department any violation of the law or ordinances, breach of peace, disturbance or altercation resulting in violence occurring on the licensed premises.
(2)
Due cause may also be found should the licensed establishment have become a trouble spot in the judgment of the city manager by reason of disturbance or acts of disorderly conduct or violence having occurred on the licensed premises thereof; provided that when the license of any establishment has been revoked or renewal of license denied because the establishment has become a trouble spot, no further license shall be issued under this chapter to any person at that location for a period of at least 12 months from the date of revocation in the sole discretion of the city manager.
(3)
Due cause shall also consist of the business or the operation or location thereof of the owner or any person connected therewith ceasing to meet any of the qualifications for the issuance of license as stated in this chapter.
(4)
Due cause may also be found upon the revelation of any false statement or material misrepresentation in any application hereunder. Any material omission from or untrue or misleading information which is contained in an original, renewal or transfer application for license hereunder shall be cause for the denial or refusal of a license, and if any license has previously been granted under such circumstances, the same shall constitute due cause for suspension or revocation of such license.
(5)
Failure to control operation resulting in public nuisance. If the failure to control the operation on the licensed premises results in controlled substance use or abuse, prostitution, gambling, flagrant indecent conduct or obscenity, fighting, excessive noise, loitering or illegal parking, to the number of times and extent that the city manager, after proper hearing, should find the establishment to have become a public nuisance, then such failure may be declared to be due cause for suspension or revocation of the alcoholic beverage license for such establishment, or the denial of renewal application for same.

The bringing, taking, or carrying of alcoholic beverages into a house, apartment, room, or other unit designed for and/or used for private residential occupancy, or into the environs of such locations, shall not be considered "brown bagging".
(d)
Permitted uses. Except as provided for in paragraph (g) below, no license holder (including agents or employees) of any business establishment in the City of Moultrie shall permit any person to enter upon the premises of the establishment carrying any opened or unopened package, can, bottle, flask, keg, or container of alcoholic beverage for the purpose of consumption therein (commonly referred to as "brown bagging") unless the license holder is licensed by the City of Moultrie to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises.
