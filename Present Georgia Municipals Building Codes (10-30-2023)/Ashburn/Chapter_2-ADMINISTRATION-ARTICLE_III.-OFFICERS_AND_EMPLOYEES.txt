DIVISION 2. - EMPLOYEE DRUG TESTING

Sec. 2-81. - Findings.
(a)
The city intends to hire employees who can provide efficient and effective service to the citizens of the city.
(b)
After careful thought and consideration, the city council has determined that it is necessary to take a strong position in opposition to drug use.
(c)
Drug use on the job endangers the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city and city employees.
(d)
The city desires to be a drug-free workplace and intends to implement a drug policy and drug testing program.
(Ord. No. 00-05, § 1, 8-3-2000)
Sec. 2-82. - Policy.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
The city is concerned for the well-being of all city employees. That concern has led the city to take a strong stand on drug abuse. There is ample evidence that drug use is bad for employee performance. Simply stated, drugs have no place in the city's employ.
(2)
The city believes it has a responsibility to provide a safe, healthy, and productive working environment for all city employees. To accomplish this goal the city must rely on a close manager/employee relationship to surface problems.
(3)
The city endorses efforts to devise high quality standards for drug testing. Such standards will reassure the public and city employees and help reinforce overall the quality of drug testing which impacts the city's ongoing program to address the problems of drug use in the workplace.
(4)
The United States Congress has enacted the Drug-Free Work Place Act of 1988. The purpose of this law is to ensure that work done under federal contract or federal grants is performed in a drug-free environment.
(5)
Drug abuse and use at the workplace are subjects of immediate concern in society. From a safety perspective, users may impair the well-being of all employees, the public at large, and result in damage to city property. Therefore, in addition to prohibiting employees from engaging in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of illegal drugs in the workplace, the city prohibits its employees from engaging in such illegal activities at all times and at all places. Such activities, even during nonworking hours, clearly affect an employee's ability to perform his or her public duties.
(b)
Conditions. The city adopts the following as its drug free policy:
(1)
No employee of this city may illegally engage in the manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance at any time or place, including while at his or her workplace. Such unlawful activity will be considered sufficient grounds for an adverse personnel action, up to and including dismissal from employment.
(2)
Any employee who gives or in any way transfers a controlled substance to another person or sells or manufactures a controlled substance while on or off the job will be subject to discipline up to and including termination.
(3)
The term "controlled substance" means any drug listed in 21 USC 812 and other federal regulations. Generally, these are drugs which have a high potential for abuse. They also include legal drugs which are not prescribed by a licensed physician. Drugs that are legally prescribed but are being abused are also included.
(4)
Each employee is required to inform his or her department head within five days after he or she is arrested or convicted for violation of any criminal drug statute of any jurisdiction, regardless of whether the alleged violation occurred at the workplace or elsewhere. The employee must notify his or her department head and the city manager, in writing, of each conviction. A conviction means a finding of guilt, including a plea of nolo contendere, or the imposition of a sentence by a judge or jury in any federal or state court.
(5)
Failure to comply with any part of this policy will result in serious adverse personnel action, including possible dismissal from employment.
(6)
Any questions that any employee may have concerning this policy should be directed to the city clerk.
(Ord. No. 00-05, § 1, 8-3-2000)
Sec. 2-83. - Abuse prohibited; right to test.
(a)
Drug and alcohol abuse by city employees is prohibited. This shall include the use of illegal substances, the abuses of prescription medications, and the use or abuse of alcohol during and immediately preceding work hours or while on city premises.
(b)
The city reserves the right to test any and all applicants as potential employees of the city. The determination of the positions to be tested are clearly stated in the policy and program description. Exceptions require the concurrence of the city council.
(Ord. No. 00-05, § 1, 8-3-2000)
Sec. 2-84. - Preemployment screening.
(a)
The following provisions apply to applicants considered for employment with the city:
(1)
Applicants considered for employment or rehire will be screened for drugs as a routine part of the preemployment physical for specified job classes. Employees who are being considered for reinstatement or who are rehired must also receive a drug test prior to return to work after appeal or assuming new duties.
(2)
Applicants will be requested to sign a consent release form authorizing the designated lab to perform the drug screening and submit the results to the city manager.
(3)
Applicants who refuse to sign the consent release form or who show traces of illegal drugs will not be considered for employment for a period of six months. Applicants who subsequently reapply for employment after the six-month period will again be requested to sign a consent release form and be required to pass a drug screening test that shows no signs of illegal drugs or abuse of prescribed drugs.
(4)
Applicants shall be given only one valid drug screening review within a six-month period. If the first test shows positive, the applicant may elect to pay for a confirmation test.
(b)
Any employee who has been arrested for a drug or alcohol violation may be required to submit to a drug and/or alcohol test. Failure of an employee to report the arrest shall be deemed a violation of this policy and shall subject the employee to immediate disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment.
(c)
Whenever an employee takes a physical exam in relation to his or her employment, continued employment, or return to work following an absence for six weeks or longer, he or she shall be tested for drugs and/or alcohol.
(Ord. No. 00-05, § 1, 8-3-2000)
Sec. 2-85. - Procedures.
(a)
Employees who are requested to submit to a drug or alcohol test will be asked to sign a consent release from authorizing the laboratory, physician, or certified intoximeter operator to perform the test and release the results to the city manager. An employee will fill out a form listing any and all drugs he or she has been prescribed and any other over-the-counter drugs he or she is taking. All results of these tests will be held in the strictest confidence by the city manager.
(b)
Employees who refuse to sign a consent release form or who are identified as having prohibited substances in their system may be disciplined up to and including termination of employment. Any employee tested under this section will be suspended with pay for up to five days pending the results of the tests.
(c)
All samples of body fluids provided in compliance with this policy shall be used only to test for the presence of drugs or alcohol.
(d)
For employees placed on probation following a prior positive drug test, the testing will take place without prior notice at irregular intervals throughout the term of the employee's probation. This testing will in no event be more frequent than twice in any calendar month. Probationary testings shall be directed by the city manager, who shall determine the dates of the probationary test and shall inform the employee when to report for testing.
(Ord. No. 00-05, § 1, 8-3-2000)
Sec. 2-86. - Disciplinary actions.
(a)
The following employment actions apply when an applicant or employee tests positive pursuant to this division:
(1)
Applicants. Applicants testing positive shall not be employed at the time. Applicants who are denied employment for this reason may reapply for employment after six months from the date of the positive drug test.
(2)
Employees. Employees testing positive shall be subject to one or more of the following employment actions: suspension without pay and/or termination of employment and/or mandatory participation in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program. All employees not terminated following a positive test shall be placed on probation for one year following the date of testing. All positive results from a drug test will be verified by a confirmation test using the GCMS test.
(b)
Any personnel action taken under this drug testing policy shall be reviewed by the city council and with the advice and counsel of the city attorney at the option of the city manager.
(c)
Failure to comply with any part of the city drug testing program will result in serious adverse personnel action, including possible dismissal from employment.
(d)
Termination will be automatic in the following cases:
(1)
Selling drugs on or off the job.
(2)
A positive drug test while on probation under the city drug testing policy.
(3)
Nolo plea, guilty plea, or conviction of a second DUI offense.
(4)
DUI while operating a city vehicle.
(5)
Two misdemeanor violations (nolo, guilty plea, or conviction) of the controlled substance laws within a three-year period.
(6)
Felony violations of drug laws.
(e)
While dismissal from employment will occur in most cases, the following factors must be considered prior to taking any personnel action. Strong, mitigating circumstances may provide an opportunity for disciplinary action other than dismissal. The following guidelines shall apply:
(1)
Public safety personnel will be held to a higher standard.
(2)
Position within the department (supervisory personnel will be held to a higher standard).
(3)
Gravity of liability and workers' compensation exposure to city.
(4)

(5)

(6)
Any other occurrences where the circumstances indicate disciplinary actions may be required.
(f)
Failure to appear at the designated collection site when directed or other failure to take the test shall subject the employee or applicant to the same sanctions as if the test had been positive. Supervisors must notify the city manager immediately when an employee fails to show for drug testing.
(Ord. No. 00-05, § 1, 8-3-2000)
Sec. 2-87. - Management and supervisory guidelines.
The guidelines in this section are for use by managers and supervisors at all levels and in all departments. They are intended to provide assistance in the administration of the drug testing program.
(1)
The city encourages any employee who has a drug or alcohol problem to obtain assistance. Therefore, if such an employee has not been required to submit to a drug or alcohol test or has tested negative but in good faith requires assistance for his or her problem, the employee shall be referred to a treatment and counseling program. This voluntary admission shall not be used against the employee.
(2)
Each supervisor is responsible for taking appropriate action whenever an employee's demonstrated judgment or performance seems to be impaired by the possible use of alcohol or drugs.
a.
Supervisors who suspect that an employee is unfit for duty should arrange, if practical, for at least one supervisor to observe and evaluate the employee's behavior. The employee's supervisor should ask the employee to explain why he or she appears unable to perform the job duties.
b.
Should the employee fail to explain the impaired condition to the supervisor's satisfaction and it is still the supervisor's determination that drugs or alcohol may be involved, the supervisor may, upon consultation with designated senior staff/management, accompany the employee or make necessary arrangements for the employee to be taken by another supervisor to the designated lab, physician, or certified intoximeter operator for testing.
c.
If the employee refuses to go, the employee should be warned that he or she will be held accountable for unfit behavior. Additionally, the employee would be disciplined for insubordination. Depending upon the employee's condition, the employee should be taken home and told when to report back to work. The supervisor should exercise caution in committing to any specific disciplinary action prior to consultation with the department head and staff.
(3)
Supervisors will document in writing all incidents, investigations, and actions regarding suspected drug or alcohol abuse. If disciplinary action occurs, a full report by the department head/director should be sent to the city manager.
(4)
When a supervisor observes the manufacture, use, sale, dissemination, or possession of illegal drugs or alcoholic beverages by employees on the job, the supervisor should take the following steps:
a.
Call the sheriff.
b.
Separate all parties involved and take them to a location where they can be questioned by the sheriff department's personnel about the incident, in the presence of another supervisor.
c.
Report the incident to the immediate supervisor.
d.
Upon completing the pending investigation, take the employee home, if necessary.
Following any incident that might fall under these guidelines, it is essential that the immediate supervisor make a detailed record of all actions, observations, statements, and other pertinent facts, to include date, time, location, and witnesses to the incident. The supervisor should not record his or her opinion or conclusion (i.e., the employee appeared to be on drugs) but rather the supervisor should simply state his or her observations (i.e., the employee was hyperactive, argumentative, loud, obnoxious, sweating profusely, pupils were constricted, etc.). This report shall be forwarded to the city manager.
(5)
If an employee has been arrested for a drug-related or alcohol-related offense while off duty, the employee will be required to report the arrest promptly to his or her immediate supervisor. Management should investigate the nature of the offense to determine if disciplinary action is necessary.
(6)
If a supervisor reviews a report and finds that an employee has violated the city's drugs and alcohol abuse policy, the supervisor shall document all available information regarding the incident and shall forward it to the city manager. Documentation shall include, but is not limited to:
a.
Suspected employee's full name.
b.
Times of observed drug or alcohol usage.
c.
Frequency of use, if appropriate (i.e., occasionally, in the parking lot after work).
d.
Specific locations of use, such as in a specific house or car.
e.
Other participants or witnesses.
f.
Any unusual behavior that would indicate that the observed individual was intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance.
(7)
The employees of the city police department, covered employees as defined by the Department of Transportation, 49 CFR 192, 193, or 195, any other person operating hazardous machinery, or anyone operating a vehicle in his or her official capacity shall be subject to additional rules and policies related to drug and alcohol testing, consistent with the general purposes of these rules and attached to Ordinance No. 00-05 and made a part of this antidrug program policies and procedures adopted August 21, 1990, and revised August 1999. Additional rules for certain employees are implemented due to the high levels of employee performance required, the public interest, and visibility of the employees, and responsibility for the protection of life and property. Additional rules and policies shall include unannounced random drug testing, including temporary employees in this category, to determine the presence of prohibited drugs.
(8)
Records of all drugs/alcohol test analyses, observation records of supervisors, and any other administrative reports relating to drug and/or alcohol use or abuse by an individual employee shall be maintained in a separate locked file available only to the city manager or to the city manager's designee, or to any persons who have an official need-to-know basis for requesting these documents. This information shall not be released to any outside person, agency, or department.
(Ord. No. 00-05, § 1, 8-3-2000)
Sec. 2-88. - Guidelines for testing procedures.
All testing procedures under this division will be administered and accounted for by an approved laboratory and/or medical facility that is operating in compliance within the National Institute of Drug Abuse guidelines.

Sec. 2-89. - Mayor and city council.
