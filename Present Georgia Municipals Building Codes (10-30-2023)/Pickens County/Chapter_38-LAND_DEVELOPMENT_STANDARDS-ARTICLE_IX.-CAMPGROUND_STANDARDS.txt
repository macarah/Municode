ARTICLE IX. - CAMPGROUND STANDARDS

Sec. 38-651. - Physical factors influencing development.
Certain physical factors influence the quality of recreational facilities that can be developed in an area. Some factors which limit the type of development possible on a given site are set out below:
(1)
Aspect. The compass direction in which a slope faces dictates its aspect. The east slope receives morning sunshine and afternoon shade and is usually the best aspect for campgrounds. The morning sun will warm and dry the site, and evening shade will cool it.
(2)
Position on slopes. The lower parts of slopes are exposed to sunshine for a much shorter period than upper portions. Therefore, lower slopes tend to be cooler and damper with poorer air drainage. As a result of poor air drainage, smoke filled and moisture laden air lingers on lower slopes. Upper slopes have the greatest extremes in temperature. They are hot during the day when exposed to the sun and are dryer, because they are more exposed to the wind. Fire is a more serious threat on dry, windswept, upper slopes than on lower slopes. The middle portion of slopes offers the best micro-climatic conditions for campground development. Morning updrafts and evening down drafts produce good ventilation and provide a moderating effect on temperatures.
(3)
Topography and slope. A site's steepness, or percent of slope, is important in determining use for campground development. Campsites should be located on slopes with less than ten percent gradient. If level places do not exist, they should be constructed.
(Ord. of 8-8-1997, ch. XIV, art. I)
Sec. 38-652. - Campground in general.
(a)
All campgrounds, regardless of whether the campsites are offered for sale, developed as rental sites, or let on assignment, are subject to the regulations contained in this article unless separate standards are specified.
(b)
Plat requirements for subdivisions apply to all campgrounds including all soil and erosion requirements.
(c)
All proposed and required water sources and sanitary facilities serving campground shall conform with the requirements of the state department of human resources, public health division, and the state department of natural resources, water supply section, as appropriate.
(d)
Permanent structures other than camp platforms and sanitary facilities shall be prohibited unless the developer or the owner can prove, to the land development office's satisfaction, the necessity or desirability of such a structure.
(e)
Mobile homes or modular homes shall be prohibited on all rental campsites.
(f)
In lieu of providing individual parking spaces for each campsite, the developer may widen minor collector roads, rural local roads and cul-de-sacs to accommodate parking on road rights-of-way, provided sufficient width is maintained to allow normal flow of traffic (see section 38-653, subsection (4) for suggested designs). Widening of roads to permit parking of main thoroughfares shall be prohibited.
(Ord. of 8-8-1997, ch. XIV, art. II)
Sec. 38-653. - Campgrounds containing rental sites or lots.
The following standards shall apply to all campgrounds, containing two or more campsites, or camp lots for rent, including sites for tents, accommodations for backpackers, recreational vehicles (RV's) and camping from automobiles:
(1)
Rules. Campsites for accommodation of RV's shall meet the requirements of Rules of the Department of Public Health for Tourist Accommodations, Revised 1971.
(2)
Density. To prevent intensive site use and to maintain an aesthetic camping atmosphere, density should not exceed ten sites per acre.
(3)
Sites:
a.
Each recreational vehicle site with individual parking shall contain at least one reinforced surface parking space incorporated into the site itself and should be level from side to side with sufficient crown to provide adequate drainage.
b.
Parking dimensions vary from single auto trailer attached vehicle back-in or 14×60 feet to side-by-side arrangements of trailer and auto of 29 feet long and 30 feet wide. Various combinations may be used, but dimensions to accommodate trailer width with extended outside awning should be at least 14 feet.
c.
RV sites should be 50 feet apart, edge to edge, with center of all camping units at least 50 feet from edge of campground road and 100 feet from streams and lakes.
d.
Camp pads or parking spaces located totally in a floodplain of a stream or drainage way shall be prohibited.
e.
Continuous camping on rental sites shall be restricted to a period of 90 days.
(4)
Road system:
a.
The ideal road circulation pattern is the one-way paved system attached to a main two-way circular thoroughfare. If a loop system is used, it shall contain a pull-through site arrangement or a back-in ranging from a 45-degree to 90-degree angle.
b.
Road widths on the one-way loop shall be 15 feet; double lane roads should have minimum width of 22 feet. The circulation's system should parallel existing contours as closely as possible and should not exceed a 16 percent slope. The turning radius in loops and turns should not be less than 30 feet; this should include parking spurs at individual RV sites.
c.
Travel trailer doors are located on the right side. Parking spurs should be located so that trailer doors face away from interior roads and into the site. Utility hookups should be located to the left rear of the RV.
d.
All roads shall have a base of four inches of aggregate, compacted. The material shall be deposited and spread by means of a spreader box or other approved mechanical equipment and compacted with a roller at the proper moisture content. The base shall be covered with a triple bituminous surface treatment. The materials and construction methods shall comply with the latest Georgia Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges.
e.
All road systems within any campground shall be privately maintained and no road within a campground shall be accepted for maintenance as part of the county road system.
(5)
Water supply:
a.
Each campground shall have access to a source of potable water approved by the applicable health authority. It is preferable to provide one water outlet per camping unit. However, a minimum of one outlet for every two units shall be provided with two hose bibs equipped with vacuum breakers. Each unit shall have access to water within 50 feet of the RV pad. All water taps or outlets serving campsites shall be of a type compatible with garden hose connections.
b.
Water outlets shall be located at least ten feet from sanitary sewer line taps and electrical outlets.
(6)
Sanitary facilities for accommodation of independent RV's:
a.
In campgrounds with access to a sewerage system, each campsite shall contain a sewer connection with suitable fittings to permit a watertight junction with the RV outlet. Each sewer connection shall be constructed so that it can be closed and when not in use shall be capped to prevent escape odors.
b.
In campgrounds which do not have access to a sewer hookup, a sanitary dump station built to recommendations to the local sanitarian shall be provided at the entrance to the campground or other location convenient to all campsites. The dump station shall be located so that the left rear of vehicles will slope slightly toward the dump station when connected for emptying. (See figure 31 for design—Refer to editor's note located at the end of this section.)
c.
Sites which do not have access to a sewer hookup shall have a convenient access to a suitable place for disposal of sink or tub water. A design for construction of an inexpensive unit is shown in figure 30 (refer to editor's note located at the end of this section).
(7)
Sanitary facilities for accommodation of dependent RV's:
a.
All campgrounds for the accommodation of dependent RV's and tents shall provide sanitary facilities connected with a sewage system.
b.
Toilets, lavatories, and bathing facilities shall be provided as follows: A minimum of one toilet stool per four camping units or fraction thereof, and one urinal for each toilet facility designated for men; one lavatory and one tub or shower head for every ten persons or fraction thereof, with a minimum of one stool, one lavatory, and one tub or shower head for each sex.
c.
Toilet facilities shall be plainly marked, separate for each sex, lighted at night, and shall be located no further than 200 feet from any camp pad.
d.
Toilet facilities may be located in a central building or in two or more buildings according to size of the campground and location of the campsites in relation to the facilities.
e.
Adequate provisions shall be made for the disposal of dishwater according to the size of the campground. A suggested ration is one disposal unit per ten campsites. (See Figure 30—Refer to editor's note at the end of this section.)
(8)
Solid waste. All campgrounds shall be provided with fly-proof, water-tight, rodent-proof containers for disposal of refuse. Containers must be sitting on concrete or asphalt pads. Containers shall be provided in sufficient number and capacity to properly store all refuse. Refuse should be collected at least once a week.
(9)
Electrical outlets. Each RV site shall have access to a minimum of one 110 volt electrical outlet supplying 30 amperes of electrical current.
(10)
Campfires. All campfires should be contained and controlled. Stoves, grills, fireplaces, pits and fire rings are recommended. Facilities should either be provided for campsites or fire restricted to designated locations. No fire shall be allowed within ten feet of a bottled gas container or other combustible source of fuel, and no open fire shall be left unattended.
(11)
Campsites for tents:
a.
Each tent site shall contain a minimum space of 30 × 30 feet. Density shall not exceed ten sites to the acre. Tent sites with individual parking arrangements should contain one automobile parking space 20 × 10 feet.
b.
Each site shall contain a reinforced, fairly level tent pad. The pad should be approximately 16 × 16 feet to provide maximum flexibility of use. However, all tent pads shall contain a minimum of 12 × 12 feet. The tent pad shall be a minimum of six-inches high and constructed of gravel, crushed aggregate, or equivalent material which will allow runoff from precipitation to flow the pad. Pads constructed of tamped earth, asphalt, or other impervious materials shall be prohibited. Tent pads in excess of ten percent slope should be leveled. A three to five percent slope is preferable.
c.
Provisions of water, solid waste disposal, electricity, and fires apply to campsites for tents.
d.
Sanitary facilities for tent sites are the same as those required for dependent RV's.
(12)
Walk-in campgrounds:
a.
Camping shall be prohibited in areas where a source of potable water and access to sanitary facilities are not provided.
b.
Walk-in campgrounds shall have access to a source of potable water within 75 feet of all sleeping areas. In locations where a water supply system is not possible, potable water may be supplied by an approved well with a hand pump or by water from pickup stations.
c.
All walk-in campgrounds shall have access to the use of a toilet facility containing a minimum of one seat for every 15 campers and a minimum of one facility for each area. A toilet facility shall be located within 300 feet of each camping area.
d.
Walk-in campgrounds shall provide a safe method of containing and controlling all campfires. Fires shall be restricted to facilities provided in each camping site. Stove, grills, fireplaces, pits, and fire rings are recommended. No open fires shall be left unattended.
e.
All walk-in campgrounds shall be provided with fly-proof, water-tight, rodent-proof containers for the disposal of refuse. Containers shall be provided in sufficient number and capacity to properly store all refuse. Refuse from walk-in camping area should be collected at least once a week.
(13)
Campsites for mixed uses. Campgrounds may be developed to provide more than one type of camping site in the same area. When uses are mixed, the highest, or most strict, standards shall apply to development of the entire campground with the exception of walk-in camping area in a campground designed for mixed use. In such a development, areas for walk-in campers should be separated from other types of campsites and located so that camp fire smoke or noise from group activities will not constitute a nuisance to other campers.
(Ord. of 8-8-1997, ch. XIV, art. III)
Sec. 38-654. - Campground design.
Various designs for campgrounds as well as detailed designs for specific features are shown in the section. The ideal design is one which will be compatible with the natural features and topography of the tract undergoing development; one which will provide safe, healthful, and convenient camping facilities for campground users; and one which can be developed at a low enough cost to provide safe, healthful, and convenient camping facilities for campground users; and one which can be developed at a low enough cost to provide a suitable margin of profit for the owner.
(Ord. of 8-8-1997, ch. XIV, art. IV)
