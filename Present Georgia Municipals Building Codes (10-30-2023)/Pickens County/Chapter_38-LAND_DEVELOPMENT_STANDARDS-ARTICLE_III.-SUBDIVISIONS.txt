DIVISION 2. - APPROVAL PROCESS

Sec. 38-101. - Definition; compliance; submission; approval.
A subdivision is defined in section 38-1 as the division of a single parcel of land into two or more parcels. All future subdivisions of land in the county shall comply with the applicable provisions of this chapter. The subdivision approval process and submission requirements vary with the magnitude of the subdivision. All minor subdivisions shall be submitted to and approved by the county development officer as provided for in section 38-102. All major subdivisions of land shall be submitted to the county development officer for review and approval as outlined in section 38-103. All plats shall be submitted to and approved by the county development officer before they can be recorded in the county clerk's office.
Any subdivision of a tract into two or more parcels, with a subsequent subdivision of one or more of said parcels within a twelve month period may be presumed to be the creation of a subdivision and, if so, shall comply with subdivision standards. Variances may be granted where division of property is due to inheritance or additional residences for immediate family.
(Ord. of 8-8-1997, ch. III, art. I; Res. of 8-6-1999, § 6)
Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 38-102. - Minor subdivision approval process.
All minor subdivisions of land in the county shall be submitted to the county development officer for review and approval. The subdivision of one tract into two tracts does not require the preparation of a plat. All minor subdivisions which contain three or more tracts shall submit a final plat which complies with the provisions outlined in section 38-152. The county development officer shall review the proposed subdivision for compliance with this chapter. Any variance from the standards in this chapter, including only one division of original property, must be approved by the county development office.
(Ord. of 8-8-1997, ch. III, art. I, § 3.100)
Sec. 38-103. - Major subdivision approval process.
All major subdivision proposals shall be submitted to the county development officer for review and approval. The major subdivision approval process is a three-step process. The process is designed to provide a logical sequence of reviews and events in the subdivision development process. The major subdivision review process shall be as follows:
(1)
Preliminary plat. The process begins with the preparation of a preliminary plat by a surveyor or engineer who is licensed in the state. The preliminary plat shall contain the information outlined in section 38-127 of this chapter and be reviewed and approved as outlined in section 38-128.
(2)
Construction of improvements. The second step in the subdivision process shall be the construction of the necessary improvements to the subdivision (i.e. streets, lot corner stakes, drainage, water system, on-site wastewater treatment and disposal facilities, if applicable). The improvements shall closely approximate the plan approved on the preliminary plat.
(3)
Final plat. Upon the completion of the necessary improvements, or following the provisions contained in section 38-301 et seq. of this chapter, the developer shall prepare a final plat which will serve as an "as built" drawing for the subdivision. The final plat shall contain the information outlined in section 38-152 of this chapter and be reviewed and approved as outlined in section 38-153. Upon obtaining approval of the final plat, the developer shall be authorized to record the plat in the county office of the clerk of superior court. No property shall be sold prior to final plat approval. The developer may chose to exercise the provisions of section 38-301 et seq. of this chapter in the second step of the review process.

(2)
Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines and radial to curved street lines.
(3)
Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of buildings so as to conform to the building setback lines from both streets.
(4)
Double frontage. Double frontage lots (i.e., lots having street frontage both in front and rear) shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from railroad or major street rights-of-way or where necessary due to topography. Where a railroad or major arterial right-of-way, as shown on the major thoroughfare plan, abuts or runs through any portion of the subdivision, the subdivision plan shall provide for either a marginal access or lots backing onto such right-of-way having a minimum depth of 200 feet.
(5)
Building lines. Residential building setback lines shall be at least 55 feet from the centerline of the street or road. A corner lot shall meet the setback requirements of both streets. The building shall be setback from the side and rear lot lines a minimum of 15 feet. Violations of setback lines shall be subject to fines as set forth in section 38-9 and/or be subject to removal of that portion of the structure which is in violation of the setback distance.
(6)
Lot width. The minimum lot width for residential use at the building setback line shall be as follows:
EXPAND
Feet
  Single-family .....110
Duplexes .....150
(7)
Panhandle or flag lots. "Panhandle" or "flag" lots, of required width and area will be allowed where terrain makes standard design or frontage impossible or impractical. Where such lots are allowed, the street frontage of each panhandle access shall not be less than 20 feet wide and the panhandle access shall be not more than 300 feet long. Not more than two such panhandle access points shall abut each other, and if so combined, the width of each panhandle may be reduced to not less than 15 feet. All such access points or combinations thereof shall be separated from each other by the frontage of a standard lot required under the other provisions of these standards.
(8)
Lot area. Subdivision lots shall have minimum lot sizes per single-family and two-family unit use, in square feet, as follows:
EXPAND

Secs. 38-183—38-189. - Reserved.
DIVISION 5.1. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION

Sec. 38-190. - Purpose.
It is the purpose of this section to enable developers to assist Pickens County in achieving the goals of Pickens County Joint Comprehensive Plan and Green Space Plan by providing flexibility in ensuring preservation of open space within a master-planned residential development. A conservation subdivision design preserves open space while maintaining the pro-rated density of residential units for the overall site area. Neutral density is achieved by allowing smaller individual owned residential lots in neighborhoods that are surrounded by aesthetically and ecologically important areas. The goal of the design process is to identify and set aside conservation open space areas prior to the delineation of transportation and residential pod layouts. Open space areas include wetlands, river buffer zones, woodlands, playing fields, and meadows, depending on the resources of the land.
(1)
The intent of the conservation subdivision regulations is to:
a.
Preserve significant areas of land for ecological, recreational, and agricultural purposes in perpetuity;
b.
Encourage more efficient development of land consistent with public health, safety, and general welfare;
c.
Afford greater flexibility of design and placement of buildings and structures;
d.
Preserve and protect exceptional terrain, natural beauty, or sites of historic interest from inconsequential placement of homes, roadways, utilities and appurtenances;
e.
Preserve all the streams and tributaries in Pickens County as natural resources;
f.
Prevent flooding, erosion, and water pollution, and protect the quality and quantity of drinking water;
g.
Preserve wetlands, aquifers, topographical or soil features, marine and wildlife habitat; and other features having conservation values, including views, vistas, and indigenous vegetation;
h.
Promote a less sprawling form of development.
(Res. of 1-22-2004, § 1)
Sec. 38-191. - Procedure.
Conservation subdivisions are allowed as a permitted right in accordance with the requirements set forth in this division, 5.1, of the Pickens County Subdivision Regulation. Also, the conservation subdivision regulation is a floating zone, which is allowed within residential zoning districts in the presence of any land management regulations for Pickens County.
(Res. of 1-22-2004, § 1)
Sec. 38-192. - Housing density determination.
The number of lots created shall be density neutral. Density neutral is defined as maintaining the number of lots so as not to exceed the number that can be created with the conventional minimum area and width as established in Pickens County Subdivision Regulations and any land management regulations.
(1)
Number of lots. The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the applicant:
a.
Calculation: The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size as determined by the Pickens County Environmental Health Department (if septic is needed) or land management regulations for Pickens County for a conventional subdivision design plan. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel:
1.
Slopes over 25 percent of at least 5000 square feet contiguous area.
2.
The 100-year floodplain.
3.
Bodies of open water over 5000 square feet contiguous area.
4.
Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act.
5.
Roads and rights-of-way necessary for the effective movement of vehicles.
b.
Yield plan: The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan or plat does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan or plat, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations.
(Res. of 1-22-2004, § 1; Res. of 2-26-2009, § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 38-193. - Open space.
(a)
Definition. Open space is the portion of the conservation subdivision that has been set aside for permanent protection. Activities within the open space are restricted in perpetuity through the use of an approved legal instrument (see sections 38-193(f) and 38-193(g)).
(b)
Standards to determine open space.
(1)
The minimum restricted open space shall comprise at least 40 percent of the gross tract area.
(2)
The following are considered primary conservation areas and are required to be included within the open space, unless the applicant demonstrates that this provision would constitute an unusual hardship and be counter to the purposes of this chapter:
a.
The 100-year floodplain;
b.
Riparian zones of at least 75 feet width along all perennial and intermittent streams;
c.
Slopes above 25 percent of at least 5000 square feet contiguous area;
d.
Wetlands that meet the definition used by the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act;
e.
Populations of endangered or threatened species, or habitat for such species; and
f.
Archaeological sites, cemeteries and burial grounds.
(3)
The following are considered secondary conservation areas and should be included within the open space to the maximum extent feasible:
a.
Important historic sites;
b.
Existing healthy, native forests of at least one-acre contiguous area;
c.
Individual existing healthy trees greater than eight inches caliper, as measured from a distance of five feet from ground level;
d.
Other significant natural features and scenic vistas such as ridge lines, peaks and rock outcroppings, particularly those that can be seen from public roads;
e.
Prime agricultural lands of at least five acres contiguous area; and
f.
Existing trails that connect the tract to neighboring areas.
(4)
Above-ground utility rights-of-way and small areas of impervious surface may be included within the protected open space but cannot be counted towards the 40 percent minimum area requirement (exception: historic structures and existing trails may be counted). Large areas of impervious surface shall be excluded from the open space.
(5)
