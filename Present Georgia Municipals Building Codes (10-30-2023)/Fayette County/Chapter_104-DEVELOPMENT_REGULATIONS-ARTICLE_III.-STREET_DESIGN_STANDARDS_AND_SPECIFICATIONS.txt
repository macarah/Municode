Internal local. Streets that primarily serve an individual development and provides traffic circulation within that development.
(Code 1992, § 8-48; Ord. No. 2012-06, § 1, 4-12-2012)
Sec. 104-50. - Traffic impact studies.
(a)
Effective May 1, 2012, all subdivisions or site plans for proposed developments shall include an estimate of the average gross daily trips expected as a result of the project once fully developed and built-out. The number of trips shall be estimated using the ITE's trip generation rates. A traffic impact study shall be required for all developments estimated to generate a number of gross daily trips equal to or greater than threshold values established by the engineering department. The ADT of existing roads shall be determined by the engineering department and the data and means used to do so shall be shared with the project's owner upon request.
(b)
Traffic impact studies shall be prepared under the supervision of a professional engineer licensed in the state and with appropriate experience and knowledge of the subject matter. The final report shall he stamped and signed by the engineer.
(c)
The studies shall include, at a minimum, an assessment of existing and proposed traffic volumes and level of service for all existing roads and intersections within a "zone of influence" proposed by the design engineer and approved by the county's engineering department. Mitigation measures, to be agreed upon between the owner and the board of commissioners, shall be required for developments causing a significant impact to the county's transportation system, as determined by the engineering department. This may include, but is not limited to, a drop in level of service (LOS) of two letter grades (e.g., from LOS B to D) or any drop to a LOS of E or below that is not predicted without the proposed development, LOS values shall be established for both roadway segments and intersections.
(d)
Traffic impact studies shall provide options for mitigation that at least maintain the LOS that are predicted without the proposed subdivision or development in the year full build-out is expected. Concept-level cost estimates for the mitigation measures shall be included in the report.
(e)
Traffic impact studies, if applicable, shall be submittal with the preliminary plat for subdivisions or with the site plan for other types of developments. Additional guidance on the development of gross daily trips and traffic impact studies is available through the county's engineering department.
(f)
Rezoning applications. At the request of the technical review committee, a concept-level traffic impact study may be required by the applicant during the rezoning process. The purpose of the concept-level study is to ensure the applicant and county have:
(1)
A mutual understanding of the expected traffic impacts associated with the project;
(2)
Agreement on the probable need for mitigation measures; and
(3)
Similar expectations on the order-of-magnitude for the mitigation measures, if needed, development of a concept-level traffic impact study does not preclude the need for a full study at lime of subdivision or site plan submittal nor in any way limit the ultimate findings and conclusions of the full study.
(Code 1992, § 8-49; Ord. No. 2012-06, § 1, 4-12-2012)
Sec. 104-51. - Exemptions.
At the discretion of the county engineer, the following types of projects may be exempted from the traffic impact study requirements:
(1)
Developments of regional impact (DRI);
(2)
Projects with one or more access point on a state route; and
(3)
Projects initiated by, or partially funded by, the county or one of the county's incorporated areas.
(Code 1992, § 8-49.1; Ord. No. 2012-06, § 1, 4-12-2012)
Sec. 104-52. - Right-of-way.
(a)
When permits/approvals are required. Approval from the county public works department is required prior to performing any construction work or nonroutine maintenance work within the county right-of-way. This includes but is not limited to the following: grading, landscaping, drainage work, and temporary access to land. Approval may be provided in the form of a driveway application permit, utility permit, construction plans, land disturbance permit (issued by stormwater management department) or written approval from the county engineer for unique circumstances that are not covered by the aforementioned. Work performed within county right-of-way without proper permits/approvals is subject to a stop work order and/or barricade, displacement or closure by public works. Any costs incurred to correct work perform unlawfully shall be reimbursed to the county by the adjacent property owner.
(b)
Right-of-way minimum widths. The following table serves a guide for planning, design and acquisition:
EXPAND
Functional Classification Minimum Right-of-Way
Major arterial Per GDOT
Minor arterial 100 feet
Collector 80 feet
County local 60 feet
Low-volume local 60 feet
Internal local 60 feet
  The values in this subsection are recommended minimum widths. Additional right-of-way may be required based on a road's characteristics. In all cases the right-of-way shall extend at least 12 feet beyond the edge of pavement.
(c)
Right-of-way donation and acquisition. Owners shall donate right-of-way to the county, as needed, when developing or improving a property in one of the manners identified below. The amount of right-of-way required for donation shall be determined by public works using the functional classification minimum standards prescribed in subsection (b) of this section.
(d)
Compensation. No compensation shall be provided to the property owner for improvements (e.g., fences), landscaping, trees or other items located on the land to be donated, although the county shall be responsible for removing such items, as needed, once the donation is made.
(e)
Subdivisions. Right-of-way donation shall be provided, as needed, pursuant to article XV of this chapter, pertaining to subdivision regulations, for any subdivision that is creating one or more new lots.
(f)
Nonresidential developments. Any nonresidential development requiring new or improved access to a public road and a site plan or land disturbance permit from the county shall donate right-of-way, as needed. Developments that front both sides of a public road that does not have the minimum right-of-way width shall donate the necessary land along the development's road frontage to meet the requirements. The donation shall be made equally on both sides of the road such that the road's centerline is the center of the right-of-way. Developments abutting only one side of such a road shall donate the necessary land to provide a minimum of one-half the required right-of-way, as measured from the road's centerline.
(g)
Development along gravel roads. Any development along a gravel road maintained by the county and requiring new or improved access and a site plan or land disturbance permit from the county shall donate right-of-way, as needed. Developments along both sides of a gravel road shall donate the necessary land along the development's road frontage to meet the requirements. The donation shall be made equally on both sides of the road such that the road's centerline is the center of the right-of-way. Developments abutting only one side of such a road shall donate the necessary land to provide a minimum of one-half the required right-of-way, as measured from the road's centerline. This requirement applies to residential as well as nonresidential developments since any amount of development along a gravel road furthers the need for maintenance and increases the likelihood of paving the road in the future.
(h)
Future transportation projects. The public works department shall maintain a list of transportation projects supported by the board of commissioners and planned for implementation at some point in the future. These projects may include, but are not limited to, new road construction, road widening, multiuse path construction, and intersection improvement projects. When a future transportation project adjoins or traverses a proposed subdivision or development project, the county may require the appropriate future right-of-way needed for the project to be platted as part of the subdivision or development project. Unless, the "future transportation project" is required to support the proposed subdivision or development, the county shall purchase the property from the owner following the county's policy for right-of-way acquisition.
(i)
Building line setbacks for future right-of-way. This section establishes requirements for right-of-way donation and acquisition associated with various land development and improvements projects. The purpose of this section is to establish appropriate building line setbacks for developments located along roads with right-of-way needs, pursuant to the thoroughfare plan, but exempt from providing the required right-of-way at the time of development or subdivision. Examples include residential building permit applications on paved roads and minor revisions to final plats. These developments shall establish building line setbacks from the required future right-of-way line or existing right-of-way line, whichever is greater. Doing so ensures the building or other improvement will be located a sufficient distance from the road once anticipated safely, operational, or capacity improvements are made to the road. For example, a building application permit for construction of a new home on a paved road with 60 feet of right-of-way shall establish setbacks using a future right-of-way line measured 40 feet from road centerline if the road is shown as a collector per the county's thoroughfare plan. For situations in which this requirement causes undue hardship, a variance may be sought through the county zoning board of appeals pursuant to article IX of chapter 110, zoning.
(Code 1992, § 8-50; Ord. No. 2012-06, § 1, 4-12-2012)
Sec. 104-53. - Construction requirements for roads and streets.
(a)
General information. Placement of the base material and asphalt shall be inspected and approved by the engineering department as specified below. The owner of the project shall be responsible for requesting such inspections by the county. A minimum advance notice of 24 hours shall be provided when scheduling inspections. Placement of base and/or asphalt shall not be done until such inspections have been conducted. Unless noted otherwise, all tests and data, as required per this section, shall be provided by the owner at no cost to the county. All inspections shall be documented and include pertinent information such as date, time, inspector, weather, station numbers, results of inspection, required action, etc.
(b)
Subgrade. Kill areas shall be deconstructed in eight- to 12-inch lifts. Individual lifts shall be compacted using sheepsfoot rollers (or pneumatic tire rollers for cohesionless and low-cohesion soils) or similar equipment capable of obtaining the required compaction. The centerline profile shall conform to the established elevations within an acceptable tolerance of 0.1 foot. A surveyed as-built centerline profile shall be provided to the county for all collectors and arterials, and for any segment of a local road identified by the engineering department as having potential safety or drainage concerns.
(1)
Soil density tests shall be performed on roadway fills four feet in height or greater. Compaction tests shall be performed on every other lift (i.e., every 16 to 24 inches) at 100-foot intervals along the fill section. Compaction tests shall be performed to within 12 inches of the final grade of the subgrade. Fill areas shall be compacted to 95 percent maximum dry density per the standard proctor test (ASTM D698. AASHTO T99). The locations of the density tests are subject to county approval and additional test locations may be required if there are areas of questionable compaction.
(2)
The density testing shall be conducted by an independent third party selected by the owner and approved by the engineering department. If the subgrade compaction is less than the required percentage the owner shall remove, replace, and/or recompact the area in question, or use other means approved by the engineering department, until the density meets the required standards. Signed copies of all test results shall be submitted to the engineering department.
(3)
The compaction of the top 12 inches of subgrade shall be inspected by a proof roll inspection (see below). The proof roll inspection of the subgrade shall not be conducted until all applicable density test results have been submitted to, and approved by, the engineering department.
(c)
Lateral subdrains. Lateral subdrains shall be installed at locations shown on the approved construction plans. Unless approved otherwise, subdrains shall be placed at a minimum interval of every 500 feet for roads with a continuous grade of two percent or less and in all sag vertical curves and cul-de-sacs. The top of the stone surrounding the subdrain shall be at the interface of the subgrade and base. The subdrains shall extend from the road's centerline to the nearest drop inlet or ditch on either side of the road. In cul-de-sacs, the subdrain shall be designed to accommodate the location of the drop inlet and expected groundwater flow. Subdrains shall consist of a six-inch perforated plastic pipe placed near the bottom of a two feet wide by two feet deep ditch backfilled with clean No. 57 stone. Filter fabric shall be placed around the perimeter of the ditch prior to backfilling and the fabric folded over the top prior to placement of base material. A lateral subdrain detail is available from the engineering department to assist with design and installation.
(d)
Base. Base thickness shall be verified by field measurement and shall not be deficient in any area by more than one-half inch from the specifications on the approved construction drawings. Deficient areas shall be corrected by adding additional quantities of the same base material and rebuilt to the desired thickness. The owner, at his expense, shall prepare the holes for measurement. Measuring holes shall be dug every 500 feet, or less, to confirm the required base thickness. At least one additional measurement shall be taken for every measurement that is less than the minimum base thickness (excluding the one-half-inch tolerance). A representative from the county engineering or road department shall determine the measuring hole locations and confirm the depth of base.
(e)
Proof-rolls. Proof-roll inspections shall be conducted on the subgrade prior to placing base and on the base prior to pacing asphalt. The purpose of the proof-roll inspection is to ensure the subgrade and compacted based course have sufficient stability to support any and all types of heavy equipment used to build the road without pumping (i.e., vertical or horizontal displacement of the material due to a variety of factors, including too much water, not enough compaction, etc.). Proof-roll compaction inspections of the subgrade and base (two independent inspections) shall be by a loaded tandem-axle dump truck having a total weight of 56,000 pounds (28 tons). Any area not passing the proof-roll inspection shall be corrected by the owner at no cost to the county and then scheduled for reinspection.
(f)
Asphaltic and Portland cement concrete construction of roads and streets. The following table indicates the minimum material type and thicknesses for various types of roads within the county. At the discretion of the engineering department, the pavement design may be dictated by the anticipated surrounding land use rather than functional classification. Specifically, roads serving office-institutional and commercial uses shall be built to "collector" standards; and roads serving manufacturing or industrial uses shall be built to "arterial" standards:

  The materials, methods and quality control used for installation of Portland cement concrete shall meet all applicable standards and specifications provided in the document titled section 439-Portland Cement Concrete pavement for Local Roads, Streets and Parking Lots, dated July 13, 2010. A copy of these standards and specifications are available through the county's engineering department. Pavement and base thickness shall be established in the concrete design and paving plans prepared for each project and alternate designs (i.e., from those specified above) may be used if approved by the engineering department.
Exceptions to applicable GDOT standards and specifications, for either asphaltic concrete or Portland cement concrete, may be provided, upon request, by the engineering department exceptions shall only be valid if requested in writing and approved by the engineering department prior to start of paving operations.
(g)
Core samples. Pavement thickness shall be verified by core samples. The pavement thickness shall be considered unacceptable if it is deficient in any sample by more than one-fourth inch from the requirements on the approved construction drawings. Samples shall be taken every 500 feet from the center of a travel lane, alternating lanes between samples. A minimum of three samples shall be collected for every street (if less than 1,500 feet) with one of the three samples taken from the cul-de-sac, if present. Additional samples may also be required at pavement joint lines (typically road centerline) if field observations indicate a concern about thickness in these locations. At the discretion of the engineering department, additional samples may be required to isolate areas of concern around samples with asphalt thicknesses below the tolerance level.
(1)
The remedy to correct areas with insufficient pavement shall vary depending on the road type. For roads with no curb and gutter, the remedy shall include an overlay of an asphalt mix that matches the existing road surface and placed at a lift thickness within the accepted range for that mix type. Joints shall be milled to allow for a smooth transition between existing and new asphalt. The overlay shall extend to the nearest intersection if it is located within 100 feet of the problem area.
(2)
For roads with curb and gutter, the asphalt, base and subgrade shall be removed, as needed, to allow room for placement of base and asphalt in accordance with the county standards and approved construction plans. The finish elevation of the top course of asphalt shall be flush with the gutter. Joints shall be milled to allow for a smooth transition between existing and new asphalt. The overlay shall extend to the nearest intersection if it is located within 100 feet of the problem area.
