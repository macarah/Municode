Landscaping shall be staggered double rows of evergreen trees a minimum of six feet in height when planted and spaced every ten feet on center. Landscaping shall be installed on the outside of the required security fence. Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large wooded lots, the zoning administrator may determine that natural growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient in lieu of the required landscaping. If existing vegetation is to remain and requested to count toward the landscaping requirements, all such information, including location, size, and type of vegetation shall be indicated on the site/landscape plan. These requirements shall not apply to a tower facility associated with an alternative tower structure.
(7)
Maximum height for all towers and antennas is 500 feet. Tower height shall be measured from the natural grade of the ground at the location of the tower to the highest point of the tower, including any antenna, but excluding any lightning rod. If minimal grading (elevation of one to two feet above natural grade) is required to level the ground for the tower base, tower height shall be measured from the finished grade approved by the county engineer.
(8)
No signage, other than required safety signage, shall be placed on a tower structure or antenna.
(9)
Aesthetics and lighting requirements. The following compatibility standards shall govern the aesthetics and lighting of any tower facility, including the installation of antennas on towers:
a.
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and equipment cabinets shall be architecturally compatible with, the color and texture of the supporting structure. Roof-mounted equipment cabinets shall be screened so as to make the equipment visually unobtrusive.
c.
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority.
(10)
Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. Prior to the abandonment of any tower or antenna, a copy of the notice of intent to abandon required by the FCC shall also be submitted to the county planning and zoning department. Any antenna or tower, including pre-existing towers and antennas, that is not in use for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the governing authority notifying the owner of such abandonment. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.
(11)
Performance bond required. Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a new tower structure, every applicant shall be required to deposit a performance bond with the county. The amount of the bond shall be equal to ten percent of the total construction cost or a minimum of $5,000.00, whichever is greater. Such bond shall be required upon compliance with all aspects of this section and shall be applicable to any assignee and owner of any permit granted hereunder, or any employee, contractor, subcontractor, or other party performing services in connection with any certificate of zoning compliance issued by the planning and zoning department.

This minimum distance requirement shall not apply from existing government-owned towers where co-location is not permitted or from alternative tower structures.
(3)
Alternative tower structures.
a.
The purpose of an alternative tower structure is to diminish, camouflage, or conceal the appearance of towers and antennas to reduce the visual impact on surrounding properties and streets. Depending on the nature of the site, the proposed alternative tower structure shall be appropriate and in character with its surroundings. For example, the use of a monopine is more fitting on a site with stands of mature trees; whereas, the use of a flag pole or light pole alternative tower structure is more suitable for the developed portion of a site.
b.
Alternative tower structures shall comply with the general requirements herein with the exception of security fencing requirements, landscape requirements, and tower separation requirements of both the highway corridor and outside of the highway corridor. Alternative tower structures shall be allowed in the highway corridor, outside of the highway corridor in the zoning districts listed herein, and in conjunction with the following existing conditional uses:
1.
Church or other place of worship;
2.
Developed residential recreational/amenity areas;
3.
Private school; and
4.
Telephone, electric, or gas sub-station or other public utility facilities.
c.
Alternative tower structures, in conjunction with the above listed conditional uses, shall meet the setbacks established in the general requirements or the conditional use setbacks, whichever is greater.
d.
An alternative tower in excess of 120 feet in height shall require public hearings before the planning commission and board of commissioners.
e.
A maximum of one alternative tower structure shall be allowed per lot.
f.
The alternative tower structure shall match the visual simulation depiction and engineering detail and specification drawings from the manufacturer/supplier of the alternative tower structure specifically proposed for the site.
g.
Design review and approval process: alternative tower structures shall go through a design review and approval process before the planning commission. The purpose of this design review and approval process is to determine that the alternative tower structure type is appropriate for the site and surrounding area and set requirements for the alternative tower structure type, placement on the site, equipment structures, fencing and landscaping. The design review and approval process application shall include the following:
1.
An analysis of the nature and character of the site and how the alternative tower structure is appropriate in context to the site and the view from surrounding properties and streets;
2.
A visual simulation consisting of color photographs of the proposed site with the existing view and with a depiction of the proposed tower, from a minimum of four distinct quadrants (generally north, cast, south, and west), to demonstrate the visual impact on surrounding properties and streets; and
3.
Engineering detail and specification drawings from the manufacturer/supplier of the alternative tower structure specifically proposed for the site which shall indicate all applicable requirements herein.
h.
Monopine towers.
1.
Monopine towers shall maintain the natural conical appearance of a loblolly pine tree. Antennas shall be placed a minimum of five feet below the top of the tower, as measured from the highest point of the antenna to maintain said appearance.
2.
Foliage shall be green in color and the tower shall be brown in color. The antennas shall be green to blend with the foliage and the foliage shall extend a minimum of one foot beyond the antennas. The foliage shall be UV resistant to reduce degradation and fading and constructed to withstand winds of 110 mph, certification of such shall be supplied with the application. Foliage shall be placed on the tower down to the height of the foliage of surrounding trees. The structure shall have sufficient limbs at the time of initial installation so that there is no gap between the existing canopy and the lower most limbs of the monopine.
3.
The installation of the foliage on the monopine shall be installed prior to final inspections. Foliage on the monopine shall be maintained and/or replaced to the specifications established by the engineering detail and specification drawings from the manufacturer/supplier of the alternative tower structure specifically proposed for the site to retain the screening of the antennas. Upon notice from the county that the foliage is in need of maintenance and/or replacement, the tower owner shall have 90 days to make such repairs.
i.
Flag pole and light pole alternative tower structures shall utilize internal antennas and slick stick design. Flag poles utilized as an alternative tower structure shall be exempt from article V, General provisions, structures permitted above the height limit.
(f)
Public hearings required to reduce or waive requirements.
(1)
Public hearings before the planning commission and board of commissioners are necessary to reduce or waive requirements for a proposed tower, antenna, or equipment cabinet or building that cannot comply with the general requirements, and/or supplemental requirements. The procedure for said public hearings shall follow the procedure for rezoning (see article VII of this chapter). Applicants shall apply for public hearings through the planning and zoning department. The application with deadline submittal and public hearing dates is available in the planning and zoning department. The application shall include the following:
a.
A scaled concept plan, drawn on the signed/sealed survey, graphically indicating the lot and leased area, total tower height including antennas, type and design of the tower structure, the boundary of the tower facility, all applicable setbacks, ingress/egress, landscaping areas, and zoning of the subject property and adjacent property;
b.
Inventory of existing or planned tower sites. When a proposed tower cannot meet the separation requirements between towers, an inventory of existing or planned tower sites shall be required to sufficiently demonstrate that no existing or planned tower can accommodate the proposed antenna. Each applicant for a new tower shall contact the owners of all existing and planned tower sites, including those located within all adjacent municipalities and counties that are within the search area of the applicant's proposed tower location. The inventory shall be prepared by a radio frequency engineer. The inventory shall include the following information:
1.
All tower owners and the number of carriers for each tower site;
2.
The site location, total height, and design type of each tower;
3.
Details of all existing and planned towers or structures located within the search area and the ability of such to meet the applicant's engineering requirements, including, but not limited to: sufficient height, structural support strength, and electromagnetic interference with antennas on the existing towers or structures;
4.
Other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable; and
5.
Letters of rejection for requests to co-locate on all existing and planned towers within the search area of the proposed tower.
The county will engage an independent expert review of the inventory of existing and planned tower sites. If the actual cost to the county for independent expert review of the document is greater than the application fee, the applicant shall be billed for the difference and payment shall be made prior to the hearing before the board of commissioners. An inventory of existing and planned tower sites which is lacking of the information above, as determined by the independent expert, shall require a resubmittal of the lacking information and postpone the tower application to the next scheduled cycle of public hearings. The inventories of existing or planned tower sites are available as an information source to assist other applicants applying for approval under this chapter, provided; however, that the planning and zoning department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
c.
A balloon test shall be conducted prior to the public hearings. The balloon shall be flown for a minimum of four daylight hours from the location of the proposed tower, at the requested height. The application shall include the date and time of the balloon test and an alternative date, in case of inclement weather. The initial balloon test shall be held on a Saturday and the alternative date may be held on any day of the week. A sign announcing the dates of the balloon test shall be posted on the property by the county a minimum of five calendar days prior to the initial balloon test; and
d.
The applicant shall submit a visual simulation, based on the balloon test, a minimum of seven calendar days prior to the planning commission public hearing. Failure to meet this deadline will postpone the tower application to the next scheduled cycle of public hearings. The visual simulation shall consist of color photographs of the proposed site with the existing view and with a depiction of the proposed tower, from a minimum of four distinct quadrants (generally north, east, south, and west), to demonstrate the visual impact on surrounding properties and streets. An affidavit certifying that the correct location and height of the tower were utilized in the balloon test shall be submitted with the visual simulation photographs.
(2)
Factors considered in public hearing applications. The following factors shall be considered when evaluating a tower application:
a.
Height of the proposed tower;
b.
Distance of the tower to residential structures and residential zoning district boundaries;
c.
Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
d.
Topography of the site and its effect on the efficiency of the tower in terms of coverage;
e.
Surrounding tree coverage and foliage and its effect on the efficiency of the tower in terms of coverage, as well as, its effect on the visual impact of the tower on surrounding properties and streets;
f.
Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
g.
Proposed ingress and egress; and
h.
The degree of the tower's compliance with the one statute mile separation (inside the highway corridor) or 1½ statute mile separation (outside the highway corridor).
In granting its approval to waive or reduce requirements, the county, through the board of commissioners or its designee, may impose conditions that are necessary to minimize the adverse effect of a proposed tower or antenna on adjoining property. A site application shall be submitted within 60 days of the date of approval by the board of commissioners or the proposed tower will no longer be deemed a planned tower.
