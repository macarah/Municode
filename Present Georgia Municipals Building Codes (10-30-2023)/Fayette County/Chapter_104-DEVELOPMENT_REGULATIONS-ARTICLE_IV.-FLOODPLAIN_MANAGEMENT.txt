Editor's note— Ord. No. 2015-07, § 1, adopted August 23, 2015, repealed the former art. IV, §§ 104-83—104-91, and enacted a new art. IV as set out herein. The former art. IV pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Code 1992, §§ 8-1, 8-81, 8-84—8-89; Ord. No. 2010-08, § 3, 8-26-2010.

Sec. 104-83. - Introduction.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation that may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect public health, safety and general welfare;
(2)
Flood hazard areas serve important stormwater management, water quality, stream corridor and bank protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas;
(3)
Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can:
a.
Protect human life and health;
b.
Minimize damage to private property;
c.
Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and
d.
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
(4)
Article IX, section II of the constitution of the state and section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a)) delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the county does ordain this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.

The elevation data shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same.
(d)
Building standards for residential single-lot developments on streams without an established base flood elevations and floodway (A-zones). For a residential single-lot development not part of a subdivision that contains an area of special flood hazard, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), the environmental management department shall review and reasonably utilize any available scientific or historic flood elevation data, base flood elevation and floodway data, or future-conditions flood elevation data available from a federal, state, local or other source, in order to administer the provisions and standards of this article. If data are not available from any of these sources, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to twice the width of the stream or 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream, whichever is greater.
(2)
In special flood hazard areas without base flood or future-conditions flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the ground immediately around the building and positive drainage must be provided at a minimum two percent slope away from the building. Flood openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided for flood prone enclosures in accordance with subsection (a)(5) of this section.
(e)
Standards for subdivisions.
(1)
All subdivision proposals shall identify the areas of special flood hazards and provide base flood elevation data and future-conditions flood elevation data;
(2)
All residential lots in a subdivision proposal shall have sufficient buildable area outside of the future-conditions floodplain such that encroachments into the future-conditions floodplain for residential structures will not be required; and
(3)
All subdivision plans will provide the elevations of proposed structures in accordance with section 104-88(b).
(f)
Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, and debris or erosion potential. Floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (g)(2) of this section;
(2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and
(3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the environmental management department until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the environmental management department.
(g)
Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is maintained. The environmental management department may direct the property owner (at no cost to the county) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the environmental management department.

The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments.
(Ord. No. 2015-07, § 1, 4-23-2015)
Sec. 104-89. - Variance procedures.
The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.
(1)
Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the environmental management department. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the environmental management department. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(2)
Any person adversely affected by any decision of the environmental management department shall have the right to appeal such decision to the Fayette County Planning Commission as established by the county in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the county planning commission. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(3)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Fayette County Planning Commission may appeal such decision to the county state court, as provided in section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1).
(4)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(5)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(6)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(7)
In reviewing such requests, the environmental management department and the Fayette County Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter.
(8)
Conditions for variances.
a.
A variance shall be issued only when all of the following conditions are met;
1.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
2.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
3.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
b.
The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief
c.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property and such costs may be as high as $25 or $100 of insurance coverage provided.
d.
The environmental management department shall maintain the records of all variance actions and report them to the GA DNR upon request.
(9)
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as environmental management department and the Fayette County Planning Commission shall deem necessary for consideration of the request.
(10)
Upon consideration of the factors listed in subsection (8) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the environmental management department and the Fayette County Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
(11)
Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."
