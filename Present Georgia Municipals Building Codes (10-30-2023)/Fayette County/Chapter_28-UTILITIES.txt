ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

Sec. 28-190. - Findings.
The board of commissioners of the county makes the following findings:
(1)
An independent professional engineering and financing analyses as prepared by Integrated Science and Engineering, Inc. properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities of the unincorporated county.
(2)
Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analyses, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems in unincorporated Fayette in concert with other water resource management programs.
(3)
Stormwater services are applicable and needed throughout the unincorporated boundaries of Fayette County. While specific service demands may differ from area to area at any given time, a stormwater service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the unincorporated boundaries of Fayette County is consistent with present and future needs of the community.
(4)
The stormwater needs in unincorporated Fayette County include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Stormwater management benefits all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of Fayette County in a variety of ways. These benefits may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and risk exposure.
(5)
Fayette County presently owns and operates stormwater systems developed over many years. To effectively and efficiently manage these systems, the county is obligated to have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management operating and capital investment needs.
(6)
A stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of providing stormwater services.
(7)
Impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the county, and therefore is the basis upon which fees are calculated. Credits may be available as provided herein.
(8)
The existence of privately owned and maintained systems that reduce or otherwise mitigate the cost of providing stormwater services can be taken into account to reduce the user fee.
(9)
Stormwater utility user fees shall be dedicated to stormwater services as provided herein.
(Code 1992, § 19-96; Ord. No. 2011-08, § 1, 9-22-2011; Ord. No. 2014-11, § 1, 7-10-2014)

Hydrologic response means the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area; the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property; antecedent moisture conditions; and groundwater conditions on a property.
Impervious area/impervious surface. Man-made areas or surfaces that prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil, e.g., rooftops; asphalt-, concrete-, brick-, or stone-paved areas; and all driveways and parking areas.
Non-single-family residential property means developed property that consists of various nonresidential land uses including, but not limited to:
(1)
Multifamily, commercial, office/institutional, public, transportation, industrial, manufacturing and storage buildings and facilities;
(2)
Parking lots, parks, public and private schools, universities and hospitals;
(3)

ARTICLE VII. - UNDERGROUND MARKING STANDARDS

Sec. 28-231. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Emergency means a sudden or unforeseen occurrence involving a clear and imminent danger to life, health, or property; the interruption of utility services; or repairs to transportation facilities that require immediate action.
Extraordinary circumstances means circumstances other than normal operating conditions which exist and make it impractical or impossible for a facility owner or operator to comply with the provisions of this article. Such extraordinary circumstances may include, but shall not be limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, ice and snow, and acts of God.
(Ord. No. 2014-02, § 2(19-71), 1-23-2014; Ord. No. 2014-02A, § 1, 6-26-2014; Ord. No. 2015-08, § 1, 6-11-2015)
Sec. 28-232. - White lining.
(a)
Background. White lining is a practice that has been widely used in the United States where the National Transportation Board concluded that pre-marking is a practice that helps prevent excavation damage. The procedure simply involves an excavator using white paint to indicate the route or area that is going to be excavated, such that the locator then knows exactly how much marking is required and where. White lining reduces confusion about what utilities need to be marked or not marked.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of white lining is to allow everyone involved with the dig site to know the exact location of the proposed excavation. White lining the excavation site is an excellent way to assist the utilities or utility locators in marking lines in the work area right the first time and in less time. This technique eliminates speculation by the locator about where the excavation will take place and will often enable the utility or its agent to locate faster and more accurately. In short, pre-marking the area and the extent of the intended excavation can reduce delays and the time it takes to perform the locate.
(c)
Examples; timing. Examples of areas to be white lined are smaller (involving only a portion of a particular address) or linear excavations such as telecommunication drops and lines, service lines (such as for water, gas, electricity and sewer), utility pits, cuts and repairs, curb repairs, bore holes, directional boring pathways, pole and signage placements, etc. Such examples are merely explanatory of the type of excavation where white lining is appropriate and are not meant to be exclusive. White lining shall be completed prior to contacting GA811 to obtain a locate request ticket number. Electronic/virtual white lining shall be clearly marked on submitted documentation within a 20' tolerance zone of the proposed excavation site.
(d)
Exceptions to white lining. Exceptions are allowed as follows:
(1)
For large projects as defined in O.C.G.A. § 25-9-3 (18), unless one or more utility facilities are damaged three times or more collectively by a contractor making the locate request within a 90-day contract period, white lining will not be required for any large project so designated in accordance with GSPC Rule 515-9-4-.13. A copy of GSPC Rule 515-9-4-.13 currently in effect is attached to Ordinance No. 2014-02 as exhibit "A" and by this reference is incorporated herein; said exhibit is on file in the county offices. Every contractor begins each large project with zero damages. It is only when three damages (at-fault damages) occur during the 90-day period of the specific large project that the white lining requirement will be triggered. A large project ticket holder whose past prohibits it from being exempt, as stated above, will be subject to no more than a two-day shutdown period and shall be required to white line the remainder of the project to meet the large project marking facility locating agreement schedule that the ticket holder and utility originally agreed upon;
(2)
Homeowners/occupants involved in excavation or land disturbance that is confined to a single address or parcel. Homeowners/occupants shall not submit locate requests for excavation or land disturbance that will be performed by a business, a contractor, or a utility. Businesses, contractors, and utilities are not exempt from white lining;
(3)
Emergencies and extraordinary circumstances as such terms are defined herein, are statutory exceptions to the requirement for obtaining a locate ticket prior to commencing mechanized excavation and, hence, also exceptions to the requirement for white lining under this section. However, if a particular emergency notification is later determined not to have been an emergency or an extraordinary circumstance, then the excavator's failure to procure a locate ticket before excavating will be treated as a violation of this section. Also, pre-excavation emergency locate ticket requests (that is, a request for a locate ticket on an expedited basis sooner than the prescribed time limit) will not be an exception to white lining as required in this section;
(4)
Residential telecommunication service drop lines that can be delineated by the route of the existing line on the ground for single residential address/parcel requests only; and
(5)
Termite baiting systems.
(e)
White lining symbols as directions to locator. White lining proposed dig sites that will follow a single path or trench shall be marked using white lines and/or arrows and shall be located for 20 feet on either side of the white line and for 20 feet outward beyond the designated "START" and "END" of such linear white line. Therefore, it is important to identify the starting and ending points.
(f)
Identification of white lining excavator. In order to enable the locating utility or its locators to quickly identify the requested locate at the job site and expedite the locating process, such excavator when white lining shall identify himself or itself by labeling the white line area with the excavator's name or the applicable locate ticket number or both.
(Ord. No. 2014-02, § 3(19-72), 1-23-2014; Ord. No. 2014-02A, § 2, 6-26-2014; Ord. No. 2015-08, §§ 2—6, 6-11-2015)
Sec. 28-233. - Facility marking by or for utilities.
Facility owners or their locate contractors shall indicate utility facilities by placing their UPC alpha code, along with the type material (if known) that the facility consists of, at the beginning and end of locates. Also, arrows should be placed at the ends of markings to indicate that the underground facility continues. In accomplishing the locate task, the line locator shall use industry-approved and generally accepted methods of locating. The tolerance zone shall be 18" measured horizontally from the outer edge of either side of such marked utility facilities.
(1)
To avoid confusion on long runs, the marks shall be frequent enough to identify the owner.
(2)
The marks shall indicate the approximate centerline of the underground lines. For example, the middle of the cable, line or pipe shall be at the center of the dashed marks.
(3)
Location marks shall be 4 to 12 inches in length and at intervals of 5 to 10 feet. If the facility to be marked has a greater diameter than 12 inches the size of the facility shall be indicated if known. If size is not known, then the mark shall be greater than 12 inches.
(4)
The line locator (person marking the lines) shall extend marks outside the proposed work area by 20 to 30 feet if those facilities extend outside the proposed excavation area.
(5)
In areas such as flower beds, rock gardens, etc., flags or stakes may be an alternative to paint. The decision to use flags, paint, or stakes shall be based on the terrain and job conditions, for instance, flags or stakes in wet areas, offsets in dirt construction zones that have a high volume of traffic crossing their line location marks.
(6)
Dead ends, stub-outs, termination points, etc., shall be marked as follows:
(7)
Lines that have connections (e.g., T's or Y's) or changes in directions shall be clearly indicated. Marks indicating lines or connections shall clearly show the intersection and path of the line or connection. Marks that show changes in direction shall be placed closer together for more clarity and accuracy.
(8)
Manholes and valves shall be identified by using a circle and letters if they are not visible (dirt covering valve boxes or pavement covering manhole cover).
(9)
Facilities that cross but do not intersect shall be marked as described to indicate such installation manner.
(10)
Unlocateable sewer laterals shall be marked by placing a green triangle on the sewer main and, if the location of the tap for such unlocateable sewer lateral is known, by placing a green "T" or "Y" or other appropriate symbol at the tap pointing generally toward the address served by such unlocateable sewer lateral.
(11)
When facilities share the same trench, they shall be heavily identified and separated enough so that they can be readily identified. This would apply to lines that share the same color code. For example, cable television and telephone lines:
(12)
If the facility to be marked has a diameter greater than 12 inches, the size of the facility shall be indicated if known. If the size is not known, then the mark shall indicate greater than 12 inches.
(13)
Duct structures shall be marked by using a dot with parallel boundary on each side of the dot.
(14)
In areas where there is a strong likelihood that any or all marker types showing line location would be destroyed, offsets shall be placed on a permanent surface. However, offsets should be used only in conjunction with marks placed above a facility. Offset spacing should be every third or fourth mark. For example, the following mark would indicate the line is 16 feet from the end of the arrow.
(15)
In areas where cables are spliced, the facilities should be located individually as far as possible on both sides of the splice. When the signal is distorted due to the near proximity to the splice a circle with "SP" should indicate the area of distortion or "splice pit."

Sec. 28-234. - Facility protection/damage prevention requirements for contractors/excavators/utilities
(a) When excavating is to take place within the tolerance zone, the contractor/excavator/utility shall utilize at least one of the following: hand digging, pot holing, soft digging, vacuum excavation methods, pneumatic hand tools, or other mechanical methods that may be developed. Other mechanical methods may be used with the approval of the facility owner or operator.
(b)
Any person involved in an excavation with mechanized equipment found digging or performing land disturbing activities within the "tolerance zone" of a facility without evidence of "potholing" will be found to be in violation of this article.
(c)
The tolerance zone shall be 18" measured horizontally from the outer edge of either side of such marked utility facilities.
(d) White lining is a mandatory practice except as stated in section 28-232 (d) (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5).

ARTICLE VIII. - EMERGENCY WATER SUPPLY FOR PRIVATE WATER SYSTEMS

Sec. 28-251. - Purpose and intent.
The Board of Commissioners of Fayette County finds that every citizen of Fayette County should have a reliable drinking water source in sufficient quantity for day-to-day living requirements. The board of commissioners further acknowledges that not every Fayette County citizen chooses to purchase drinking water from the Fayette County Water System, although the Fayette County Water System produces more than enough daily volume of drinking water to meet the needs of all the citizens of Fayette County. Some Fayette County citizens choose to obtain drinking water from wells either on or off their property. Other Fayette County systems receive their water from private water systems as defined herein. The purpose and intent of this article in the Fayette County Code is to recognize that a solution should be available for those Fayette County citizens who are part of a private water system and, for whatever reason, are not receiving any drinking water, and to provide that solution. The individual property owner has opportunities available to him or her which are not available to those Fayette County citizens who receive water from a private water system. Individual property owners may drill another well, or hook onto the Fayette County Water System at the point nearest their property. Fayette County citizens who purchase water from a private water system, generally, do not have those options available. This article will provide the parameters within which the Fayette County Water System shall make drinking water available to Fayette County citizens who purchase water from a private water system when the private water system no longer provides drinking water for their use.
(Ord. No. 2018-07, § 1, 3-22-2018)
Sec. 28-252. - Definitions.
(a)
Fayette County Water System means the public water distribution system in Fayette County which provides drinking water to Fayette County citizens. The Fayette County Water System may provide drinking water to other than Fayette County citizens with the appropriate agreements in place.
(b)
Private water system means a water system owned by other than a governmental entity which provides drinking water to Fayette County citizens based upon a permit obtained from the State of Georgia.
(c)
Water unavailable means the lack of drinking water from the source, e.g., when a private water system has no drinking water available. A private water system or a well experiencing low pressure is not deemed to have water unavailable.
(d)
Contaminated water means drinking water which does not meet the minimum drinking water standards as established by the Clean Water Act as enforced by the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources for the State of Georgia.
(Ord. No. 2018-07, § 1, 3-22-2018)

[This system is listed as Clayton County with the State and we do not have a Corinth Woods Subdivision in our subdivision list. Corinth Drive comes off of Corinth Road in Fayette County. There are two lots in Fayette County accessing on Corinth Drive. Neither of their deeds makes reference to Corinth Woods Subdivision. The rest of Corinth Drive is in Clayton County.]
Any of these private water systems is eligible to receive water from the Fayette County Water System when water is unavailable, as that term is defined herein, within their respective private water system.
(b)
Any request for the emergency supply of drinking water from the Fayette County Water System shall be made through the Director of the Fayette County Water System. In order to be eligible to receive emergency water from the Fayette County Water System, the private water system must first comply with any requirements set out in this article in addition to any necessary requirements which, in the opinion of the water system director, shall be installed to ensure the safe provision of drinking water to the private water system.
(c)
Any private water system comprised of water lines of six inches in diameter or larger will be required to provide the cost for the installation of a vault to facilitate the installation of a water meter on county property to tie in to the private water system. Payment for the installation of the vault, where required, is a precondition to receiving drinking water from the Fayette County Water System when drinking water is unavailable in a private water system.

Sec. 28-254. - Supplying drinking water to a private water system; water meter; activation fee; cost of water; duration.
(a)
Whenever a request is made to the water system director to provide emergency drinking water to a private water system, and the water system director has determined that water is unavailable to the private water system, the water system director may cause the emergency water supply to flow to the private water system. The presence of contaminated water may not be sufficient reason for emergency water to be supplied to a private water system.
(b)
The water system director shall determine what size water meter will be required to supply water to the private water system. The water meter shall be installed on county property at the closest point to the subdivision served by the private water system. Payment for the cost of the water meter and the installation of the water meter shall be borne by the owner of the private water system. The cost of the water meter and the installation of the water meter shall be paid within ten calendar days of installation of same. Of the private water systems listed herein, the closest point from county property to the respective subdivision is as follows:
EXPAND
(i) Fayette Mobile Home Park: 55 feet;
(ii) Dix Lee'On Estates: 20 feet;
(iii) Newton Plantation: 90 feet;
(iv) Rolling Meadows Estates: 80 feet (Redwine)
20 feet (Cherokee)
(v) Four Seasons Mobile Home Park: 650 feet;
(vi) Long's Mobile Home Park: 55 feet;
(vii) Woodland Road Water Association: 20 feet;
(viii) Fernwood Mobile Home Park: 1,782 feet (S.R. 314 North);
1,950 feet (S.R. 314 South);
(ix) Starr's Mill Ridge Subdivision: 1,600 feet;
(x) Line Creek Estates: 2,500 feet;
(xi) Wendell Coffee Golf Center: 20 feet; and
(xii) Corinth Woods Subdivision: 80 feet.
  (c)
Whenever a private water system requests the delivery of emergency drinking water, an activation fee shall be charged for the delivery of the drinking water. The activation fee shall be an amount set from time to time by the Board of Commissioners of Fayette County and shall be on file at the Fayette County Water System. An activation fee shall be charged for every request for emergency drinking water where drinking water is supplied as a result of the request. Any private subdivision may be subject to more than one activation fee depending upon the number of requests made for emergency drinking water which are responded to with a supply of emergency drinking water.
(d)
The volume of drinking water provided to a private water system when drinking water is unavailable shall be charged at a rate equal to the amount of three times the water rate currently in place for purchasing drinking water from the Fayette County Water System.
(e)
When emergency drinking water is provided to a private subdivision by the Fayette County Water System, the emergency drinking water shall be provided for no more than 60 consecutive days. For purposes of this article, consecutive days are measured from the activation of the water meter to allow drinking water to flow to the private water system to the de-activation of the water meter shutting off the flow of drinking water to the private water system. When emergency drinking water has been provided to a private system for 30 consecutive days, the owner of the private water system shall begin taking appropriate steps to merge his or her private water system into the Fayette County Water System. The owner of the private water system shall pay to the Fayette County Water System an amount equal to the amount it would take for the private water system to be constructed to minimum Fayette County Water System standards.
