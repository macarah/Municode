Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any zoning district, the following rules shall apply unless otherwise specifically indicated:
(1)
Where the zoning district boundaries are indicated on the official zoning map as approximately following the centerlines of a street, road, highway, railroad right-of-way line, stream bed, river bed, corporate city limits line, or land lot line, then such lines shall be construed to be the zoning district boundary lines.
(2)
Where the zoning district boundaries are indicated on the official zoning maps as being set back from a street, road, highway, railroad, stream or river and parallel thereto, then such boundaries shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the centerline of same and parallel thereto.
(3)
Where a zoning district boundary, enacted by the adoption of the county zoning ordinance from which this chapter is derived and official zoning map on November 13, 1980, divides a lot, the zoning administrator may, administratively change the zoning of the smaller portion of said lot to coincide with the zoning of the larger portion of said lot. Said administrative rezoning, by the zoning administrator, shall take place prior to submittal of a preliminary plat, final plat, minor subdivision plat, site plan, and/or building permit, as applicable. Any changes in boundaries which occur pursuant to this provision shall be reported to the clerk of the board of commissioners.
(4)
Any development that involves multiple lots to be utilized as one lot shall be required to be combined prior to submittal of a preliminary plat, final plat, minor subdivision plat, site plan, and/or building permit, as applicable. In addition, any development which results in or is located on a lot with multiple zonings shall be rezoned to one zoning district prior to submittal of a preliminary plat, final plat, minor subdivision plat, site plan, and/or building permit, as applicable. Any existing development/structure developed on multiple lots utilized as one lot or located on a lot with multiple zonings which was approved through a preliminary plat, final plat, minor subdivision plat, site plan, and/or building permit, as applicable, prior to the adoption of this regulation on December 9, 2010, shall be allowed to continue development within the boundary established by said approved preliminary plat, final plat, minor subdivision plat, site plan, and/or building permit.
(5)
Corporate limits. Any lot divided by corporate limits (city or county) shall fully meet the requirements of the county, on the portion of the lot that is within unincorporated the county for the purposes of a building permit. All corporate limits dividing a lot will be viewed in the same manner as a property line. Setbacks arc measured from corporate city limit lines and/or county boundary lines.
