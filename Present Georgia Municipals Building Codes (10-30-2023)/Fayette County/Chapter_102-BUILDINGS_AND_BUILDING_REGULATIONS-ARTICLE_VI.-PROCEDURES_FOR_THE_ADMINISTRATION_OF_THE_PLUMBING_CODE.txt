DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 102-912. - Title.
The provisions of this article apply to the International Plumbing Code, as adopted in section 102-22. In this article the term "plumbing code" means the International Plumbing Code as adopted in section 102-22.
(Code 1992, § 5-361; Ord. No. 2006-16, § 6, 12-14-2006)
Sec. 102-913. - Scope.
The provisions of the plumbing code shall apply to the erection, installation, alteration, repairs, relocation, replacement, addition to, use or maintenance of plumbing systems within this jurisdiction. The plumbing code shall also regulate nonflammable medical gas, inhalation anesthetic, vacuum piping, nonmedical oxygen systems and sanitary and condensate vacuum collection systems. The installation of fuel gas distribution piping and equipment, fuel-gas-fired water heaters and water heater venting systems shall be regulated by the International Fuel Gas Code. Provisions in the appendices shall not apply unless specifically adopted.
(Code 1992, § 5-362; Ord. No. 2006-16, § 6, 12-14-2006)
Sec. 102-914. - Intent.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of the plumbing code is to establish the minimum requirements to safeguard life or limb, health, property and public welfare by regulating and controlling the design, construction, installation, quality of materials, location, operation and maintenance or use of plumbing equipment and systems. The purpose of the plumbing code is not to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefitted by the terms of the plumbing code.
(b)
Public duty, warranty and quality control. The permitting, plans examination or inspection conducted with regard to a plumbing system in accordance with the plumbing code constitutes a public duty and does not warrant or ensure the absence of any hazard, deficiency or other matter. Any duty created by or based on the plumbing code is transferred to the public, and no private cause of action is created by a breach of such duty. The plumbing code shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the responsibility of any person, firm or corporation owning, operating or controlling any plumbing system for any damages to persons or property caused by defects, nor shall the department of plumbing inspection or the county be held as assuming any such liability by reason of the inspections or plans examinations authorized by the plumbing code or any permits or certificates issued under the plumbing code. The code official checks for substantial compliance with the plumbing code, but reviews and inspections performed by the code official pursuant to this chapter do not create any guarantee or warranty that plumbing systems have been constructed in accordance with all provisions of the plumbing code. The permitting, plans examination, or inspection of any plumbing system or construction document shall not be construed as a warranty of the physical condition or adequacy of such plumbing system or construction document, including without limitation a representation or warranty that a plumbing system is complete, that it is in compliance with the plumbing code or any other law, that it was inspected, that it is safe or ready for occupancy or that it meets any particular degree of quality or workmanship. Quality control of materials and workmanship is not within the purview of the plumbing code, except as it relates to the purposes stated therein. The amount and quality of inspection and other services provided is discretionary with the code official and may vary in response to the amount of staff, work load, training and experience, funding and other pertinent factors affecting whether and how inspection is made or whether any hazard, deficiency or similar matter is observed.
(Code 1992, § 5-363; Ord. No. 2006-16, § 6, 12-14-2006)
Sec. 102-915. - Existing installations.
Plumbing systems lawfully in existence at the time of the adoption of the plumbing code shall be permitted to have their use and maintenance continued if the use, maintenance or repair is in accordance with the original design and no hazard to life, health or property is created by such plumbing system.
(Code 1992, § 5-364; Ord. No. 2006-16, § 6, 12-14-2006)
Sec. 102-916. - Maintenance.
All plumbing systems, materials and appurtenances, both existing and new, and all parts thereof, shall be maintained in proper operating condition in accordance with the original design in a safe and sanitary condition. All device or safeguards required by the plumbing code shall be maintained in compliance with the plumbing code edition under which they were installed. The owner or the owner's designated agent shall be responsible for maintenance of plumbing systems. To determine compliance with this provision, the code official shall have the authority to require any plumbing system to be reinspected.
(Code 1992, § 5-365; Ord. No. 2006-16, § 6, 12-14-2006)
Sec. 102-917. - Additions, alterations or repairs.
Additions, alterations, renovations or repairs to any plumbing system shall conform to that required for a new plumbing system without requiring the existing plumbing system to comply with all the requirements of the plumbing code. Additions, alterations or repairs shall not cause an existing system to become unsafe, unsanitary or overloaded. Minor additions, alterations, renovations and repairs to existing plumbing systems shall be permitted in the same manner and arrangement as in the existing system, provided that such repairs or replacements are not hazardous and are approved.
(Code 1992, § 5-366; Ord. No. 2006-16, § 6, 12-14-2006)
Sec. 102-918. - Change in occupancy.
It shall be unlawful to make any change in the occupancy of any structure that will subject the structure to any special provision of the plumbing code without approval of the code official. The code official shall certify that such structure meets the intent of the provisions of law governing building construction for the proposed new occupancy and that such change of occupancy does not result in any hazard to the public health, safety or welfare.

(2)
The clearing of stoppages or the repairing of leaks in pipes, valves or fixtures, and the removal and reinstallation of water closets, provided such repairs do not involve or require the replacement or rearrangement of valves, pipes or fixtures.

If the application or the construction documents do not conform to the requirements of pertinent laws, the code official shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the code official is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of the plumbing code and laws and ordinances applicable thereto, the code official shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable.
(d)
Time limitation of application. An application for a permit for any proposed work or operation shall be deemed to have been abandoned 180 days after the date of filing, unless such application has been pursued in good faith or a permit has been issued; except that the code official is authorized to grant one extension of time for an additional period not exceeding 180 days.
