Normal pool elevation means the lowest crest level of overflow on a reservoir or lake with a fixed overflow level (spillway crest elevation).
Perennial stream means a stream that flows in a well-defined channel throughout most of the year under normal climatic conditions.
Pollutant means any liquid, gas, solid, radioactive, hazardous or other substance that, when not used and/or disposed of in accordance with manufacturer's instructions, causes or contributes to pollution
Pollution means contamination or other alteration of any water's physical, chemical or biological properties by the addition of any constituent and includes, but is not limited to, a change in temperature, taste, color, turbidity or odor of such waters, or the discharge of any liquid, gaseous, solid, radioactive, or other pollutant into any such waters as will or is likely to create a nuisance or render such waters harmful, detrimental or injurious to the public health, safety, welfare or environment, or to domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational and other legitimate beneficial uses, or to livestock, wild animals, birds, fish or aquatic life.
Shrub means a plant with persistent woody stems and a relatively low growth habit, distinguished from a tree by producing several basal stems instead of a single trunk.
Small water-supply watershed means a watershed area that is less than 100 square miles as defined by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
State water means any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells, and other water bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of the state that are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, homeowners' association, partnership, or corporation.
Tree means a self-supporting woody perennial plant that, at maturity, has one or more stems or trunks that attain a diameter of at least three inches, a more or less definitely formed crown of foliage, and a height of ten feet or more.
Tributaries and streams mean state waters, whether named or unnamed, that continuously flow through major and minor water-supply watersheds.
Understory tree means a tree that, under normal forest conditions, grows to maturity beneath canopy trees and will generally reach a mature height of at least ten feet, but less than 40 feet. Examples include dogwood, red bud, fringe tree, lusterleaf holly, and red cedar.
Utility means a public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government.
Water supply reservoir means a governmentally owned impoundment of water for the primary purpose of providing water to one or more governmentally owned public drinking water systems. This excludes the multipurpose reservoirs owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Water supply watershed means the area of land upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water intake.
Watershed buffer means the area of a parcel set aside to provide a separation between the uses on the parcel and adjoining parcels and state waters requiring a buffer using natural vegetation, replanting, and supplemental plantings.
Watershed setback means the area of a parcel where all structures, septic tanks, nitrification fields and any impervious surfaces shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
Wrested vegetation means vegetation that has been disturbed, moved, or removed by flowing water creating a clear demarcation between water flow and vegetative growth.

(a)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare; to minimize public and private losses due to erosion, siltation and water pollution; to preserve stream water quality; and to comply with the laws of the state pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 by provisions:
(1)
Create buffers and setbacks along state waters in the county for stream bank stabilization, water resource protection, and protection of aquatic and riparian habitat; and
(2)
Minimize land development within such buffers and setbacks by limiting development activities within these protected areas and by requiring authorization for any such activities.
(b)
Applicability. The following large and small water supply watersheds, designated major water supply streams, named tributaries, minor unnamed streams, lakes and waters requiring a state buffer located in and out of the large and small water supply watersheds shall be governed by this article.
(1)
This article shall be applicable to any parcel within the unincorporated county that has been created or reconfigured after May 28, 1987, unless it is a minor revision to a recorded final plat/minor subdivision plat as defined in article XV of this chapter.
(2)
It shall be the responsibility of every property owner, developer or builder to present required plans and to comply with article IX of this chapter.
(c)
Administration of article. The environmental management director shall administer and implement the provisions of this article.
