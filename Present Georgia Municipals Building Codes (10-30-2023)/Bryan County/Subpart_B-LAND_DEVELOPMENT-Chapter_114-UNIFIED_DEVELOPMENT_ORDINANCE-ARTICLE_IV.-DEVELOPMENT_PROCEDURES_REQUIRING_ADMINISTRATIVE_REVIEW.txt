ARTICLE IV. - DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES REQUIRING ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW
This article establishes procedures for development approvals that may be approved by county staff without a public hearing.
DIVISION 1. - MINOR PLATS

Sec. 114-400. - Purpose.
The minor plat process enables staff approval of applications that have minimal impact on public facilities, do not require the construction or extension of the county roadway network or utility infrastructure, and are consistent with county zoning, subdivision, and public improvement requirements.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-401. - Applicability.
Minor plats include each of the following:
(a)
Minor subdivisions enable the subdivision of land to create a limited number of new parcels. The new parcels may be accessed from a new or existing private road or an existing public road. If the subdivision requires the construction of a new public road, extension of an existing public road, or extension of public utilities greater than 200 feet in length, the subdivision will be considered a major subdivision.
(1)
Minor subdivision served by private/public road enables the creation of a maximum of six buildable lots or parcels from a single parcel when:
a.
Access to each parcel will be from a new private road, built to county standards;
b.
Access to each parcel will be from an existing private road. If the private road is not built to county standards, the road must be brought up to current standards, unless the engineering director waives this requirement; or
c.
Access to each parcel will be from an existing county road, which is constructed to current county road improvement standards.
(2)
Minor subdivision served by private easement enables the creation of up to three lots or parcels from a single parcel when one lot will have access to a public or private road built to county standards and a maximum of two additional lots will be accessed from an easement.
(b)
Conveyance plats enable the division of land into up to six parcels of ten acres or more from a single parcel, which are not intended to be developed for any purpose requiring a building permit without subsequent subdivision approval.
(c)
Lot line adjustments enable changes to existing lot or parcel boundaries that do not create any additional lots or alter the overall density of the affected lots.
(d)
Plat corrections enable corrections to errors or omissions on a recorded plat that does not materially change the boundaries of any of the parcels shown on the plat.
(e)
Dedication plats - enable the conveyance of rights-of-way or easements.
(f)
Combination plats - enable the combination of two or more existing lots of record into one lot.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)

In the case of a TIA or TDA showing deficiencies requiring mitigation within the public right-of-way, negotiations based on the conclusions and findings resulting from the TIA or TDA shall be held with appropriate county staff. The subsequent development approval or, at the option of the applicant, a development agreement, shall identify the applicant's and the county's responsibilities for implementing identified mitigation measures.
(k)
Findings and mitigation measures. If the proposed development will not meet applicable service level standards, the engineering director shall recommend denial of the application unless the applicant submits a mitigation plan that, in the opinion of the engineering director, addresses the deficiency through one or more of the following actions:
(1)
Reduce the size, scale, scope, or density of the development to reduce traffic generation;
(2)
Divide the project into phases and with only one phase at a time being authorized until traffic capacity is adequate for the next phase of development;
(3)
Dedicate right-of-way for road improvements;
(4)
Construct new road improvements;
(5)

(10)
Integrate non-vehicular design components (e.g., pedestrian and bicycle paths or transit improvements) to reduce trip generation.
(l)
Proportionate share responsibility. If the engineering director determines that requiring the applicant to construct or fund 100 percent of the improvement would not be proportionate to the project's impact to applicable transportation infrastructure, the engineering director shall establish a proportionate (fair) share cost, and the applicant shall mitigate the impact by paying the fair share of the cost of the improvement. The applicant will be required to enter into a traffic mitigation agreement in format acceptable to the county.
(m)
Appeals. Appeals to the engineering director's decision shall be heard by the building and construction board of appeals.
(n)
Validity. TIAs and TDAs shall be valid for one year from the date of approval. The engineering director may require an updated TIA or TDA if development has not commenced within one year, and there has been a significant change in circumstances, e.g., increase in background traffic, improvements to transportation network, change in project scope, etc. If five or more years have elapsed since the TIA or TDA was approved and development has not commenced or phases of the project have not been started, an updated TIA/TDA shall be required subject to the scope established by the engineering director. For multi-phased projects, the engineering director shall determine when and if development has commenced within the five-year period.
