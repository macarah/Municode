(Code 1996, ch. 25, § 201; Ord. of 1-9-2001)
Sec. 113-2. - Purpose.
This chapter is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the county, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities with the county so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the county as a proactive county in the availability of wireless telecommunication service. To that end, this chapter shall:
(1)
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities to serve the residents and businesses of the county;
(2)
Protect the county's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities;
(3)
Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape, screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
(4)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennae;
(5)
Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the county;
(6)
Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single use towers; and
(7)
Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not likely to adversely impact property values, aesthetics or the health or safety of the populace.

Except as set forth in this section or listed elsewhere, telecommunication facilities shall not be permitted in AR-2.5 (agricultural residential district), AR-1.5 (agricultural residential district), AR-1 (agricultural residential district), R-30 (residential district), R-1 (single family residential district), R-3 (multi-family residential district), R-4 (manufactured housing park), BN (neighborhood business district), WP (waste management district), WB-1, WB-2, WB-3 (waterfront business and commercial district), PUD (planned unit development) and DM-1 (dunes and marshland districts) nor within 1,500 feet of a river corridor as defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 or as so delineated under the county comprehensive land use plan, whichever distance is greater. Telecommunication facilities shall be allowed only if the applicant provides evidence that such placement is a technological necessity in order to for the applicant to be in compliance with federal law; upon such evidence, such use shall be allowed if approved with the conditional use permit by the board of commissioners following design review by the director.
(5)
Telecommunications facilities outside the guidelines listed above may only be built upon approval of a conditional use permit except for variances to the zoning ordinance setbacks for a specific zoning district which shall be presented to the zoning board of appeals unless the request is part of a conditional use permit which is presented to the board of commissioners.
(Code 1996, ch. 25, § 503; Ord. of 1-9-2001)
Sec. 113-72. - Preferred location sites.
(a)
Publicly used structures. Publicly used structures are preferred locations throughout the county, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunication facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly used structures include police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches.
(b)
Co-location sites. Any existing site on which a legal wireless telecommunications facilities is currently located shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site; however, that location which meets this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this chapter and co-location sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise deemed by the director of the governing authority to be visually obtrusive.
(c)
Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred location sites particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roof line can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunication system.
(d)
Mixed-use buildings in planned unit development districts. Mixed-use buildings (housing above commercial or other nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites.
(Code 1996, ch. 25, § 504; Ord. of 1-9-2001)

ARTICLE VI. - REMOVAL OF ABANDONED TOWERS AND ANTENNAS

Sec. 113-141. - Removal of antennae and towers.
(a)
Any telecommunications facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of it or any part of it. The owner of a telecommunications facility and the owner of the property where the facility is located shall be under a duty to remove the abandoned telecommunications facility. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the county notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the county may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal or seek costs incurred through court action. The county may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. Delay by the county in taking action shall not in any way waive the county's right to take action. The county may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state, or otherwise, which may have been granted.
(b)
If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all the conditions of this chapter as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna.
(c)
Prior to commencement of construction of any telecommunications facilities, the owner shall post a surety bond in an amount of not less than the estimate cost of removal of tower and associated structures; which may be utilized by the county for cost of removal of the tower if abandoned, which bond shall be cumulative to any other remedy at law or as otherwise set forth in this chapter.
(Code 1996, ch. 25, § 801; Ord. of 1-9-2001)
