Sec. 38-1. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Ord. No. 23-97, art. 1, § B, 3-7-1997)
Sec. 38-2. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(5)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Ord. No. 23-97, art. 1, § C, 3-7-1997)
Sec. 38-3. - Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(3)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
(4)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(5)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(6)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
(7)
Ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(Ord. No. 23-97, art. 1, § O, 3-7-1997)
Sec. 38-4. - Lands to which this chapter applies.
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the county.
(Ord. No. 23-97, art. 2, § A, 3-7-1997)
Sec. 38-5. - Basis for area of special flood hazard.
(a)
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its flood insurance study (FIS) report and flood insurance rate map (FIRM), with an effective date of August 19, 2010, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision to the FIS and/or FIRM, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this chapter. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS/FIRM and data for the county are adopted by reference.

Sec. 38-16. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required:
(1)
New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 38-15(4), relating to elevated buildings.
(2)
Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any structure located in A1—30, AE, or AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting these provisions and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this subsection and in subsection 38-14(6).
(3)
Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
a.
All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on individual lots or parcels, in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
b.
Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either:
1.
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
2.
The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
c.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Refer to section 38-15(6).)
d.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
1.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect-type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
2.
The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a and (3)c of this section.
(4)
Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-5 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development, within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification.
b.
Only if subsection (4)a is satisfied, any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of sections 38-15—38-19.
(Ord. No. 23-97, art. 4, § B, 3-7-1997)
Sec. 38-17. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-5, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply:
(1)
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 38-5, the building official shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of sections 38-15—38-19. Only if data are not available from these sources, the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply.
(2)
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(3)
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 38-15(4), relating to elevated buildings. The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level, and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(Ord. No. 23-97, art. 4, § C, 3-7-1997)
Sec. 38-18. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones).
Areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-5, may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade.

The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level, and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(2)
New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting these provisions and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this subsection and as required in subsections 38-13(1)(c) and 38-13(2).
(3)
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(Ord. No. 23-97, art. 4, § D, 3-7-1997)
Sec. 38-19. - Standards for subdivisions.
(a)
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
(b)

Sec. 38-20. - Variance procedures.
(a)
The board of appeal, as established by the building official, shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter.
(b)
The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision to the superior court, as provided in state statute.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing such requests, the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this section and other sections of this chapter.
(h)
Conditions for variances are as follows:
(1)
A variance shall be issued only when there is a:
a.
Finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense; create a nuisance; cause fraud on or victimization of the public; or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(2)
The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief and in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this chapter, the appeals board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or improvements to a building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement or, in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage's occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been preidentified by the building official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter.
