(Ord. of 3-1-2010(1), § III)
Sec. 34-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 34-34(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPS.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections 34-34(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual For Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 34-34(b)(2) of this article;
(15)
Except as provided in subsection (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: That under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. Title 12, Chapter 5, Article 5, Part 6, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. Title 12, Chapter 5, Article 2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 34-34(b) and (c) of this article.
(e)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
(Ord. of 3-1-2010(1), § IV)
Sec. 34-35. - Application/permit process.
(a)
General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.
(b)
Application requirements.
(1)
No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Pulaski County without first obtaining a permit from the local issuing authority (joint Pulaski-Hawkinsville Building Department) to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable.
(2)
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the joint Pulaski-Hawkinsville Building Department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 34-35(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 34-34(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10.
(3)
A fee in the amount of $20.00 shall be charged for each application. In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(4)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection 34-34(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 34-35(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
(5)
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the erosion and sedimentation act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.

Secs. 34-40—34-60. - Reserved.
ARTICLE III. - RIVER CORRIDOR PROTECTION

Sec. 34-61. - Purpose.
(a)
The River Corridor Protection District is an overlay district that applies additional standards of specific areas that may lie within any State of Georgia designated protected river corridor. In each zoning district located within the boundaries of the River Corridor Protection District, both the regulations of that district and the regulations of the River Corridor Protection District apply. If required development standards are specified for the same item in both districts, the more stringent governs.
(b)
The purpose of this district is to protect certain river corridors that have been designated by the State of Georgia as Protected River Corridors because of their unique environmental importance. This district is intended to help maintain high water quality of these rivers. Other counties lying along these river corridors have adopted similar protective measures. In this manner, this state resource may be protected in a way that would not be possible by the uncoordinated action of an individual jurisdiction.
(Ord. No. 99-01, § 1, 3-19-1999)
Sec. 34-62. - Definitions.
Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations, promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 C.F.R. Section 261.3. (Note: This is the same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.)
Land-disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land-disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use.
Land uses existing prior to the promulgation of a River Corridor Protection Plan means any land use or land-disturbing activity, including all human endeavors directly associated with such use or activity, which, prior to the promulgation of the River Corridor Protection Plan falls within one of the following categories:
(1)
Is completed;
(2)
Is under construction;
(3)
Is fully approved by the governing authority;
(4)
All materials have been submitted for approval by the governing authority; or
(5)
Is zoned for such use and expenditures in excess of $2,500.00 have been made in preparation for construction in accordance with such zoning.
Local government means the governing authority of a political subdivision.
Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area means a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, The Natural Environments of Georgia. Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species.
Perennial river means a river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year.
Plan or comprehensive plan means any plan by a county or municipality covering such county or municipality or any plan by a regional development center covering the center's region proposed or prepared pursuant to the minimum planning standards and procedures for preparation of comprehensive plans and for implementation of comprehensive plans, established by the Department of Community Affairs in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 50-8-1 through 50-8-12. (Note: This is the same definition as used in O.C.G.A. § 50-8-2.)
Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents.
Public utility or utilities means a service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such service or services, and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services.
Quadrangle map means the most recently published U.S. Geological Survey 7.5 minute topographic map prepared at a scale of 1:24,000.
River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow.
River corridor means all land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440 through 12-5-457), or the Coastal Marshland Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280 through 12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks.
The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the River Corridor Protection Plan. Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for local comprehensive plans. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next review by the department of community affairs.
River Corridor Protection Plan means that part of the local comprehensive plan which deals with the river corridor protection requirements specified herein.
Sensitive natural areas means any area, as identified now or hereafter by the department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following:

ARTICLE IV. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROTECTION

Sec. 34-81. - Short title, background and objectives.
(a)
This article shall be known as the "Groundwater Protection Ordinance."
(b)
Background. Variable levels of recharge area protection can be based upon the state's hydrogeology (e.g., areas such as the Dougherty Plain where a major aquifer crops out would receive a relatively high degree of protection whereas other areas, such as the shale hills of northwest Georgia, would receive a lower degree of protection). Recharge area protection within the significant recharge areas would be further refined, based upon the local susceptibility or vulnerability to human induced pollution (e.g., high, medium, or low). The significant recharge areas have already been identified and mapped (about 22—23 percent of the state). Pollution susceptibility mapping is ongoing. Existing statutes are adequate for protecting the remaining recharge areas (about 77—78 percent of the state).
(c)
Objectives. The objectives of this article are:
(1)
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(2)
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
(3)
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 1, 3-19-1999)
Sec. 34-82. - Establishment of a groundwater recharge area district.
A groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Pulaski County, Georgia that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition.
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, 3-19-1999)
Sec. 34-83. - Determination of pollution susceptibility.
Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 3, 3-19-1999)
Sec. 34-84. - Definitions.
When used in this article, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning given in this section:
Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. (Note: This is the same definition used in the Groundwater Use Act.)
Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. (Note: The "DRASTIC" methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility.)
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharge, leaks, impoundment's, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area.
Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential.
Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contracts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces.
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 4, 3-19-1999)
Sec. 34-85. - Criteria.
The following criteria pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-18 shall apply in significant recharge areas:
