CHAPTER 13. - SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS

Section 13.1 - Applicability.
(a)
This chapter applies to the siting, construction, installation, and decommissioning of any new SES to be constructed or installed after the effective date of this Ordinance within the jurisdiction of Pulaski County.
(b)
Any SES that, prior to April 5, 2021: 1) is in operation; 2) is being lawfully sited, constructed, or installed; or 3) has caused the incurrence of substantial liabilities relating to siting, construction, or installation; shall be exempt from complying with this Ordinance, unless the surface area of an Integrated SES or Rooftop SES or the Footprint of a Ground Mounted SES is increased by more than [5—25]% after [the effective date of this Ordinance].
(c)
Unless otherwise expressly stated herein, an SES shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, including the requirements of the Pulaski County zoning code and applicable building, fire, electric, and plumbing codes. If a provision in this Ordinance directly conflicts with a requirement of the Pulaski County zoning code, the more stringent of the relevant criteria shall control. Where such conflict is deemed otherwise irreconcilable by Pulaski County, an applicant seeking to install SES may be awarded a variance, pursuant to the criteria for awarding such variances as established by the Hawkinsville/Pulaski County Zoning Board.
(d)
Unless otherwise expressly stated herein, any SES shall be subject to any design review requirements that may be instituted for the location where the SES is proposed for installation.

Solar Access. Consistent with O.C.G.A. § 44-9-20 et seq., a property owner may obtain a solar easement from another property owner for the purpose of ensuring the Integrated SES adequate exposure to sunlight.
(b)
Tree Removal. The removal of trees or natural vegetation for an Integrated SES shall be avoided to the extent reasonably practicable and shall comply with the requirements of the Pulaski County zoning code.
(Ord. No. 2021-1, § 2, 5-3-2021)
Section 13.3 - Requirements for Rooftop Solar Energy Systems.

Decommissioning. Unless otherwise approved by the zoning authority, decommissioning shall begin no later than 12 months after a Ground Mounted SES has ceased to generate electricity or thermal energy:
(i)
For a Ground Mounted SES allowed without a permit, within 6 months of the beginning of decommissioning, the SES and all structures associated with it shall be removed, all materials shall be recycled or otherwise reused to the extent reasonably practicable, and the property shall be returned to its condition prior to the installation of the SES or to some other condition reasonably appropriate for the designated land use; and
(ii)
For a Ground Mounted SES allowed with a permit, the SES shall be decommissioned in accordance with the most recent decommissioning plan approved by the zoning authority, and as further described in the Special Use Permit provision of this Ordinance.

The existing natural tree growth and natural landforms along the SES perimeter may create a sufficient buffer and shall be preserved when reasonably practicable. Any visual buffer must be established and maintained in accordance with the most recent visual buffer plan approved by the zoning authority, and as further described in the Special Use Permit provision of this Ordinance.
(c)
Signage. An Intermediate Scale SES:
