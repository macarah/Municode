ARTICLE VIII. - SPECIAL OVERLAY DISTRICTS

Sec. 24-137. - Groundwater recharge area protection district.
(a)
Intent.
(1)
In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(2)
The objectives of this section are to:
a.
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
b.
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
c.
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.
(b)
Establishment of district. A groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the county that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the state department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition.
(c)
Pollution susceptibility. All recharge areas within the county have a medium pollution susceptibility, as indicated by the state pollution susceptibility map prepared by the state department of natural resources.
(d)
Permit requirements and enforcement. The county will approve no redistricting request or subdivision plan unless the request or plan is in compliance with the groundwater protection standards listed in subsection (e) of this section.
(1)
Enforcement. The county, its agent, officers, and employees shall have authority to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of performing their duties under this article and may take or cause to be made such examinations, surveys or sampling as the county deems necessary:
a.
The county commission shall have authority to enforce this article; issue permits hereunder; and address violations or threatened violations hereof by issuance of violation notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator.
b.
Any person who commits, takes part in, or assists in any violation of any provision of this section shall be fined not more than $500.00 for each offense. Each violation shall be a separate offense and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense.
c.
The county commission shall have the authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this article. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction as identified in chapter 8.
d.
When a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this section, the violator shall be required to remove the structure.
e.
When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this section, the violator shall be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation as far as practicable.
(2)
Permit review and site plan requirement. With the exception of certain exempted activities identified in subsection (d)(4) of this section, applications for a development permit within the groundwater recharge area district shall include a site plan. The following information is required for all site plans:
a.
A map, drawn to a scale of one inch equals 50 feet or other approved scale, showing all planned improvements including the width, depth, and length of all existing and proposed structures, roads, watercourses and drainage ways, water lines, wastewater and stormwater facilities, and utility installations shall be provided by the applicant.
b.
Location, dimensions and areas of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site.
c.
The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body.
d.
Elevation of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than five feet.
e.
Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials.
f.
Calculations of the amount of cut and fill proposed and cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades in areas of fill or excavation. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on cross-sectional drawings.
(3)
Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform to the specifications of said site plan. Significant changes to the site plan that would alter the amount and velocity of stormwater runoff from the site, increase the amount of impervious surface within the development, alter the overall density of development, result in a considerable increase in the amount of excavation, fill or removal of the overall appearance of the development as proposed, can be amended only with the approval of the county commission. Minor changes, such as the realignment of streets or minor alterations to drainage structures and other infrastructure to meet unexpected conditions are exempted from this requirement.
(4)
Exemptions to site plan requirements. The following activities and developments are exempt from the requirement for detailed site plans:
a.
Single-family detached homes constructed within a subdivision of fewer than five parcels.

Sec. 24-138. - Wetland protection district.
(a)
Intent.
(1)
The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. It is therefore necessary for the county to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands.
(2)
The purpose of this district is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this district is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.
(b)
Jurisdiction and boundaries of district.
(1)
Generally. This section shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the county. A generalized wetlands map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the clerk of the county.
(2)
Boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and the wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1344), as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(c)
Local development permits.
(1)
Permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the Wetland Protection district without written permission from the county in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (c)(2) of this section shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 200 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the county or authorized designee using the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 permit or letter of permission.
(2)
Permitted and prohibited uses.
a.
The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein:

(Ord. No. 031704, § VIII, § 8.2, 3-17-2004)
Sec. 24-139. - Flood hazard district.
(a)
Intent.
(1)
The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(2)
It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
a.
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
b.
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
c.
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
d.
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
e.
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(3)
The objectives of this section are to:
a.
Protect human life and health.
b.
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains.
c.
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas.
d.
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects.
e.
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
f.
Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
g.
Ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
h.
Utilize a map showing floodprone areas inclusive of a 500-foot buffer. The map is intended to be used as a basic guide and should not be the only determining factor used to declare the floodprone area. The floodprone areas designated on the map are not all inclusive or exclusive.
i.
Encourage the use of a qualified surveyor to determine floodprone areas and so designate on plats developed by the surveyor.
(b)
Lands to which this section applies. This section shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the county.
(c)
Basis for area of special flood hazard.
(1)
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study (FIS), when available, dated (shall always be the latest date adopted or revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency), with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for the unincorporated area of the county are hereby adopted by reference.
(2)
Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. The county will utilize a map showing floodprone areas inclusive of a 500-foot buffer. The map is intended to be used as a basic guide and should not be the only determining factor used to declare the floodprone areas. The floodprone areas designated on the map are not all inclusive or exclusive. The county's map was created by the CSRA Regional Development Center GIS Specialist following general guidelines comparable to those used by FEMA and GEMA. The map was presented to a review committee, who recommended formal approval by the county board of commissioners.
(d)
Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this section prior to the commencement of any development activities.
(e)
Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable regulations.
(f)
Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this section and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(g)
Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this section, all provisions shall be:
(1)
Considered as minimum requirements;
(2)
Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
(3)
Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
(h)
Warning and disclaimer of liability.
(1)
The degree of flood protection required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes.
(2)
This section does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This section shall not create liability on the part of the county or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(i)
Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this section or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this section or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the board of county commissioners from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
(j)
Enforcement. The magistrate's court of the county shall have jurisdiction over violations of this section and all procedures for enforcement of this section shall be as provided in O.C.G.A. article 4, chapter 10, title 15 (O.C.G.A. § 15-10-60 et seq.). Complaints of violations of any provision contained herein shall be brought before the magistrate's court on a citation issued by the code enforcement officer or by a law enforcement officer. Citations shall meet all the official requirements as specified in O.C.G.A. § 15-10-63, as amended.
(k)

j.
Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this section, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
(2)
Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required:
a.
New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-35(4).
b.
Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 16-34(6).
c.
Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
1.
All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on:
(i)
Individual lots or parcels;
(ii)
In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
(iii)
In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
(iv)
On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood;
must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
2.
Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either:
(i)
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
(ii)
The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
3.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (see section 16-35(6)).
4.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
(i)
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
(ii)
Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements listed above.
d.
Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
1.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
2.
Only if section 16-35 is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 16-35.
(3)
Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply:
a.
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 16-25, then the ordinance control officer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of the floodway district. Only if data are not available from these sources, then subsection (l)(3)b and (3)c of this section shall apply.
b.
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
c.
1.
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of the "elevated buildings" section.
2.
The ordinance control officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(4)
Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Areas of special flood hazard may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet aboveground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply:
a.
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of elevated buildings. The ordinance control officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
b.
New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required.
c.
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(5)
Standards for subdivisions.
a.
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
b.
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
c.

A property owner or his designated representative, designated in writing and signed by the owner, may make application for a variance, using forms provided by the clerk, or designee thereof. Upon receipt of an application for a variance, the clerk, or designee thereof, shall schedule a public hearing before the planning commission. The clerk, or designee thereof, shall advertise such hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, and shall cause to be erected, in a conspicuous place on the property in question, a sign giving public notice of the appeal at least 15, but no more than 45, days prior to the scheduled hearing. When a producer is requesting to do anything involving poultry houses that requires a variance, any adjacent landowner shall be notified 14 days prior to any hearing with the planning and zoning board. The planning commission shall consider and decide whether to recommend approval or disapproval of all applications for variances within 30 days after such public hearing, and in accordance with the standards set forth in this subsection. Variances from the terms of this article may be recommended by the planning commission in such individual hardship cases of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the planning commission based on the following:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography;
(2)
The application of this chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship;
(3)
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
(4)
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of this chapter; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure which is prohibited by this chapter.
(Ord. No. 031704, § XII, § 12.3, 3-17-2004)
Sec. 24-231. - Limitations on variances.
A variance shall not be considered or granted from the conditions of approval imposed on a property through a land use change granted by the board of commissioners; nor may a minimum lot size required in the applicable land use district be reduced; nor may any use of land or structures be granted that is not permitted by the land use district that is applicable to the property. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(Ord. No. 031704, § XII, § 12.4, 3-17-2004)
Sec. 24-232. - Special use permits.

The board may require additional information prior to considering a request for transfer. To the extent a transfer is authorized pursuant to this section and a successor owner uses the property in a manner not approved by the special use permit, the permit shall be void. A transfer pursuant to this section is not a right, and the board of commissioners reserves the right to deny a request to transfer in its sole discretion.
