Each individual or entity that owns property in Grady County upon which one or more regulated uses are conducted must register with Grady County, prior to conducting such use or uses, by completing a registration form approved by the Grady County Board of Commissioners and by submitting the completed form to the Grady County Code Enforcement Department.
