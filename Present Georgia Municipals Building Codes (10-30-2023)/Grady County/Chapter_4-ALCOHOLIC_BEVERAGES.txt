Sec. 4-31. - Suspension; revocation; denial of renewal or transfer.
(a)
Notice, hearing. Any license which has been issued under this article, or which may hereafter be issued by the county to any licensee, may be denied, suspended or revoked or transfer refused, by the board of commissioners for due cause. Before the board of commissioners shall deny any application for a license or for the transfer of any license, or shall revoke or suspend any existing license, the applicant shall be given notice, in writing, from the clerk of the board to show cause before the board at a time and place specified therein not less than three days nor more than ten days from the date of service of the notice, why the application for, or renewal of, a license or for transfer of license should not be denied, or why the license should not be revoked or suspended, as the case may be, stating the grounds therefor, and, at the appointed time and place, the applicant or licensee shall have an opportunity to show cause, if any exist, why the application should not be denied or the license revoked or suspended, after which the board shall take such action as it, in its judgment and discretion, shall deem warranted under the facts. The hearing herein provided for need not be at a regular meeting of the board but may be at such time and place as shall be fixed in the notice. All decisions denying, suspending or revoking any license or application shall be in writing, with the reasons therefor stated, and mailed or delivered to the applicant. In addition, at any hearing as provided herein, the party afforded the hearing shall have the opportunity to present evidence, have an attorney, and have testimony recorded at his expense.
(b)
Due cause generally.
(1)
Due cause for the suspension, revocation or denial of the renewal or transfer of any license shall consist of an act or omission found to be by the board, after a hearing as provided above, a violation of any law or ordinance regulating such business, or violations of regulations made pursuant to authority granted for the purpose of regulating such business, or for the violation of any state or federal law, or for the violation of any county or city ordinances, other than traffic violations or ordinances, or failure of the licensee or his employee to promptly report to the sheriff's department any violation of the law or ordinance, breach or peace, disturbance or altercation, resulting in violence occurring inside the premises.
(2)
Due cause may also be found should the licensed establishment have become a trouble spot in the judgment of the board by reason of disturbances or acts of disorderly conduct or violence having occurred in the establishment or on the premises thereof; provided, that when the license of any establishment has been revoked or renewal of license denied because the establishment has become a trouble spot, no further license shall be issued under this article to any person at that location for a period of at least 12 months from the date of revocation.
(3)
Due cause shall also consist of the business or the operation or location thereof, or the owner or any person connected therewith, ceasing to meet any of the qualifications for the issuance of license as stated in this article.
(4)
Due cause may also be found upon the revelation of any false statement or material misrepresentation in any application hereunder. Any material omission from or untrue or misleading information which is contained in an original, renewal or transfer application for license hereunder shall be cause for the denial or refusal of a license, and if any license has previously been granted under such circumstances, the same shall constitute due cause for revocation of such license.
(5)
Failure to control operation resulting in public nuisance. If the failure to control the operation either inside the building or outside on the property results in controlled substance abuse, prostitution, gambling, flagrant indecent conduct or obscenity, fighting, excessive noise, loitering or illegal parking, to the number of times and extent that the commission, after proper hearing, should find the establishment to have become a public nuisance, then such failure may be declared to be due cause for suspension or revocation of the alcoholic beverage license for such establishment, or the denial or renewal application for same.
(c)
Emergency due cause; failure or refusal to cooperate with sheriff acting in line of duty. On evidence of failure or refusal of the licensee or employee hereunder to cooperate with any sheriff or officer of the law on any reasonable request or action within such officer's duties, responsibilities or powers, including all police powers, rights and duties to investigate to determine any pertinent fact relating to the establishment, the licensee, any employees or corporate officers or partners, the sheriff shall immediately order all sales of any alcoholic beverages suspended until after a hearing as set out in the due cause hearing provided for in subsection (a) of this section, such hearing to be concerning such failure or refusal to cooperate.
(d)
No refund of license fee. When a license is so revoked or suspended, the county shall not be required to refund any portion of the license fee.
(e)
Effect of revocation by state. Whenever the state shall revoke any permit or license to sell any alcoholic beverage at retail, the county license to deal in such product shall thereupon be automatically revoked without any action by the board of commissioners. If the state has suspended the license or placed the same on probation, the county license is automatically suspended or probated, as the case may be.
(f)
Emergency situation. The county administrator is the delegated authority to suspend any license hereunder in any emergency situation, and such suspension may be made effective immediately and remain in force until the next regular or called meeting of the board. In addition, in any emergency situation, the sheriff is hereby authorized to cause the business in question to close temporarily until he decides the emergency or possible riotous situation to be at an end, or until such decision is made by the board at its regular meeting, whichever occurs first.

Sec. 4-32. - Transfers; changes of ownership, location.
(a)
Licenses under this article shall not be transferable except as otherwise provided in this section.
(b)
In case of the death of any person owning a license, or any interest therein, with the approval of the board of commissioners and subject to the terms of this section, the license may be transferred to the administrator, executor or personal representative of the deceased person, or to the heir at law of the deceased person, if such administrator, executor, personal representative or heir meet all of the other qualifications contained herein. The license of such deceased person or personal representative of such deceased person shall be valid only for the time necessary to complete execution of his estate and disposition of the license or his interest therein, but in no event to exceed six months.
(c)
Nothing in this section, however, shall prohibit one or more of the partners in a partnership holding a license from withdrawing from the partnership and assigning his interest in such partnership to one or more of the partners who were partners at the time of the issuance of the license. Such withdrawal shall not, however, serve to bring any new ownership into the partnership, unless all provisions of this section are fully complied with, and then only upon the approval of the board.
(d)
Any change in the ownership interests contained on the application shall cause the immediate cessation of sales of any alcoholic beverages and no sales of alcoholic beverages shall be made until any such change or changes in the ownership interests are approved by the board, provided, however, that this provision shall not apply in a situation where one or more individuals who have ownership interests in the license cease to have such ownership interest, but the remaining ownership interest remains unchanged except as to the division of the remaining interests.
(e)
Should a transfer of the location be desired, the location shall meet all requirements of a new license to be issued hereunder, except payment of the license fee. The investigation fee will accompany the application and the unearned portion of the license fee may be transferred to the new location in the event the transfer of location is approved by the board.
(f)
An application for a new license on an existing licensed location shall meet all requirements of a new license to be issued hereunder except payments of license fee shall be waived only in the case of a purchaser of a business where an existing license remains valid. The investigation fee will accompany the application and the unearned portion of the license fee may be transferred to the new license in the event the transfer or issuance of a new license on an existing licensed location is approved by the board.
