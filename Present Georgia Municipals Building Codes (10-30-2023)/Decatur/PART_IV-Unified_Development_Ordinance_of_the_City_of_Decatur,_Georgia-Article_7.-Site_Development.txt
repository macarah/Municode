Sec. 7.3. - Signs

7.3.1. - Preamble and Purpose
A.
In order to protect the public safety, to protect the tranquil environment, to protect community aesthetics, to protect the public investment in streets and highways, to promote commerce and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of the citizens of the City, it is hereby determined that the public health, safety and welfare require the adoption of this Section.
B.
The purpose of this Section is to recognize that although signs and advertising are necessary, they should be reasonably regulated in the interest of protecting the public health, safety, welfare, environment and community aesthetics by the establishment of standards for location, size, illumination, number, construction and maintenance of all signs and advertising structures and for the prohibition of certain signs and advertising structures in the City.
C.
The City further finds that the rights of persons to convey messages through signs and protection of First Amendment and other constitutional rights must be balanced with other important public interests such as traffic safety hazards, protecting property values, and restricting visual clutter that results in safety dangers as well as degradation of the City's important interests in protecting and enhancing its aesthetic environment.
