Article 2. - Rules of Interpretation
Sec. 2.1. - Rules Applicable to All Districts

2.1.1. - Conformity to District Requirements
A.
Every building erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered shall be located on a lot except as approved by the City Commission under Sec. 5.4. In no case shall more than one principal building be located on a lot except as otherwise provided for in this UDO.
B.
The minimum yards, parking spaces and open spaces required by this UDO for each building existing at the time of passage of this UDO, or for any building erected or structurally altered after the passage of this UDO, shall not be encroached upon or considered as part of the yard or parking space or open space required for any other structure, nor shall any lot area be reduced below the minimum lot area for the district in which the lot is located.
C.
No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in conformity with the lot area, floor area, and building height regulations of the district in which the building is located.
2.1.2. - Density
A.
Net Site Area
1.
Net site area is determined by subtracting publicly-dedicated land, from the gross site area.
2.
Land area set aside for common open space or recreational use is included in net site area for the purpose of determining the maximum number of dwelling units. Poor drainage areas or other areas of rough terrain as to constitute land which is economically unbuildable may be counted as common open space but may not be counted as space for active recreational areas.
B.
Dwelling Units Allowed
1.
The maximum number of dwelling units allowed on a site is calculated by multiplying the net site area by the maximum number of units per acre allowed in the district.
2.
Minimum lot sizes may appear to allow additional units to be developed on a site; however, the district's allowed density serves as the cap on the maximum number of units on a site.
2.1.3. - Amenity Space
A.
Amenity space is common area and may not be designated for the use of any specific tenant or group of tenants. The space may be restricted to use by residents, tenants and their visitors only, or made available to the general public, at the applicant's discretion.
B.
Where required, amenity space must be met in one contiguous open area or in multiple open areas on the site; however, to receive credit, the area must be at least 10 feet in width and length, and at least 50% of the required amenity space must be located in one contiguous open area.
C.
Amenity space must remain unenclosed on all sides, but up to 50% of the total provided amenity space may be covered.
D.
Amenity space may be located at or above grade.
E.
In calculating the required amenity space, the following listed facilities, and any similar facilities, may be included:
1.
Ground-level facilities such as a swimming pool, playground, sport court, dog park, garden, community, garden, park, green, pavilion, outdoor dining, seating area or plaza.
2.
Upper-level facilities such as a shared or common balcony, rooftop deck or rooftop garden.
