a.
As described in its district designation, the primary value of the Clairemont Avenue District is in the public experience of the district as a historic residential corridor into the heart of downtown Decatur. The preservation of the historic character, as visible from Clairemont Avenue, is the primary goal of this district. Therefore:
i.
The review jurisdiction of the Historic Preservation Commission shall extend only to material changes to the front and side facades of principal or accessory structures that would be visible from the Clairemont Avenue public right-of-way.
ii.
Due to their temporary and non-historic nature, privacy fences and/or vegetation, that might obscure otherwise visible changes, do not remove projects from the review jurisdiction.
iii.
The Historic Preservation Commission or its designated staff member may only make the determination of what is visible from the Clairemont Avenue public right-of-way.
b.
Only proposed material changes to the exterior of the front and side facades of properties within the historic district, that would be legally required to obtain a building permit with the exception of tree removals, must be submitted to the Historic Preservation Commission or its designated staff person to determine if the project is subject to review, and if so, the level of review required.
c.
An application for a building permit for a property within the historic district will commence the review process of the project by the Historic Preservation Commissions' designee designated staff person for a determination of the project's status under these guidelines standards.
d.
Project types that must be submitted include, but not be limited to the following:
i.
New construction of principal and accessory structures.
