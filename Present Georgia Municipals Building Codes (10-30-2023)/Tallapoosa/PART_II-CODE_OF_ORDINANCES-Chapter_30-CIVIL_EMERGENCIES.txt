Fee means any fee or rate charged by the city for building permits, land disturbance permits, zoning applications, special land use permits, temporary land use permits, and other fees relating to the reconstruction, repair and cleanup of areas impacted by the disaster or emergency.

State of emergency, as defined by O.C.G.A. § 38-3-3(5), means a condition declared by the governor when, in his judgment, the threat or actual occurrence of a disaster, emergency, or energy emergency is of sufficient severity and magnitude as to warrant extraordinary efforts in preventing or alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering threatened or caused thereby.
Subsequent recovery period means the period of time that the disaster or emergency continues to cause disruptions in the area impacted by the disaster or emergency. The subsequent recovery period shall not exceed six months after the state of emergency declaration by the governor is terminated unless extended by official action of the mayor and city council.
Temporary dwelling means any mobile or easily movable home, trailer, recreational vehicle or structure not otherwise permitted by the zoning regulations in a particular zoning district.
(b)
Meetings. Upon proclamation by the appropriate state official of an emergency or disaster of manmade or natural causes or enemy attack impending on or affecting the state or the United States, the affairs and business of the city may be conducted at places other than the regular or usual place thereof, within or outside of the city, when it is not prudent, expedient or possible to conduct business at the regular location. When such meeting occurs outside of the city, all actions taken by the local governing body shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the city. Such meetings may be called by the mayor without regard to or compliance with time-consuming procedures and formalities otherwise required by law.
(c)
Public works contracts. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency by the governor, or upon determination by the mayor and city council, or its designee, of the existence of an emergency or disaster, the mayor and city council, its designee or the emergency interim successor may contract for public works without letting such contract out to the lowest responsible bidder and without advertising and posting notification of such contract for four weeks; provided, however, that any public works contract entered into pursuant to this subsection shall be entered on the minutes of the city as soon as practical and the nature of the emergency described therein.
(d)
Code enforcement. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency by the governor, or upon the determination by the mayor and city council, or its designee, of the existence of an emergency or disaster, the mayor and city council, its designee or the emergency interim successor may temporarily suspend the enforcement of this Code, or any portion thereof, where:
(1)
The emergency or disaster is of such nature that immediate action outside this Code is required;
(2)
Such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare; and
(3)
Such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations.
(e)
Fees. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency by the governor, or upon the determination by the mayor and city council, or its designee, of the existence of an emergency or disaster, the mayor and city council, its designee or the emergency interim successor may reduce or suspend any permit fees, application fees or other rate structures as necessary to encourage the rebuilding of the area impacted by the disaster or emergency.
(f)
Temporary dwellings. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency by the governor, or upon the determination by the mayor and city council, or its designee, of the existence of an emergency or disaster, the mayor and city council, its designee or the emergency interim successor may issue temporary permits for mobile homes, trailers, recreational vehicles, or other temporary dwelling structures or parks in any zoning district while the primary dwelling is being repaired, provided that such temporary dwellings or parks are designed by an engineer and the plans are approved by the county health department and county permits office. The temporary permit shall not exceed six months in duration. In the case of continuing hardship and in the discretion of the mayor and city council or its designee, the permit may be extended for an additional six months. Upon expiration of the temporary permit or an extension, the temporary dwelling shall be removed.
