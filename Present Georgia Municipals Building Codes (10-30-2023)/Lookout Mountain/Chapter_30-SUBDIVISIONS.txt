modified
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Lot means a portion or parcel of land separated from other portions or parcels by description as in a subdivision plat or record of survey map or as described by metes and bounds, and intended for transfer or for building development. For the purpose herein, the term "lot" does not include any portion of a dedicated right-of-way.
Major subdivision means all "subdivisions" that are not minor subdivisions (as defined in this section), including those that include any division of a tract or parcel of land into more than four lots or parcels, which may or may not involve the construction of a new public or private street. Major subdivision also includes any subdivision, regardless of the number of lots or parcels, that involves the construction of a new public or private street, public water extensions, sewer service extensions, or other utility extensions.
Minor subdivision means any division of a lot or parcel into four or fewer building sites, parcels, or other divisions (or redivision of the same parcel which alters lot lines) where the current lot and all resulting lots front upon an existing public road, which does not require any new or improved road, public water, sewer service, or other utility extensions, and which is not otherwise in conflict with any applicable provision of this chapter or the requirements and standards of the zoning ordinance of the City of Lookout Mountain. Such a minor subdivision may be approved by the planning commission following review and recommendation of the building and land use administrator.
Street means a way for vehicular traffic, whether designated as an avenue, boulevard, road, highway, expressway, lane, or other way, and for the purposes of these regulations, streets are divided into the following categories:
(1)
Major streets are state highways and those streets designated as major streets on the official map of the city.
(2)
Collector street is a street within a subdivision used to carry traffic from the minor streets to the major streets.
(3)
Minor street is a street used primarily for access to abutting properties. A street may be a minor street even though it is the principal entrance and circulation of a subdivision.
(4)
Cul-de-sac is a minor street having one end open to traffic and the other end permanently terminated in the minimum right-of-way and paved turn-around.
(5)
Marginal access street is a minor street parallel and adjacent to major streets and which provides access to abutting properties with protection from through traffic.
(6)
Limited street is a street used primarily for access to no more than two residential lots with one end opened to traffic and the other end permanently terminated with a turn-around.
Subdivider means the person, firm or corporation having such a proprietary interest in the land to be subdivided as will authorize the maintenance of proceedings to subdivide such land under these regulations, or the authorized agent of such person, firm or corporation.
Subdivision means any division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, parcels, or other division for the purpose of sale or building development, whether immediate or future, including, but not limited to, all divisions of land involving the dedication of a new street or a change in existing streets. The word "subdivision" includes re-subdivision and, when appropriate to the context, relates either to the process of subdividing or to the actual land or area which is subdivided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "subdivision" does not include any of the following:
(1)
The combination or recombination of portions of lots shown on subdivision plats previously recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Walker County Georgia, where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots meet all requirements and standards of the zoning ordinance of the city; provided, however, that if the previously recorded plat was subject to approval by the planning commission under the provisions of this chapter 30 of the City Code and any of the resultant lots do not meet the requirements of this chapter 30, those lots must be clearly designated as "NOT LEGAL FOR BUILDING" on the new plat;
(2)
The division of land into parcels of five acres or more where no new street is involved; or
(3)
The sale of all portions of a single, existing lot or parcel to an adjoining landowner for combination into one or more adjacent lots or parcels owned by the adjoining landowner, where the total number of lots or parcels is not increased and the resultant lots or parcels meet all requirements and standards of the zoning ordinance of the city; provided, however, that if any of the lots are part of a subdivision that was subject to approval by the planning commission under the provisions of this chapter 30 of the City Code and any of the resultant lots do not meet the requirements of this chapter 30, those lots must be clearly designated as "NOT LEGAL FOR BUILDING" on the new plat.

If blocks are used, block lengths and widths shall be as follows:
(1)
Blocks shall be not greater than 1,800 feet nor less than 600 feet in length, except in unusual circumstances.
(2)
Blocks shall be wide enough to provide two tiers of lots of minimum depth except where abutting upon major streets, limited-access highways, or railroads, or where other situations make this requirement impracticable.
(Ord. No. 291, § 1201, 1-21-2016)
Sec. 30-268. - Lot sizes.
(a)
All lots in a residential subdivision shall have a minimum public street frontage of 175 feet and a minimum depth of 200 feet, provided that the municipal planning commission may approve a subdivision lot with less than 175 feet of public street frontage if the size of the lot is more than 35,000 square feet. The terms "frontage" and "depth," as used herein, shall have the same definitions as given to those terms in Ordinance Number 25.
(b)
Residential corner lots shall have adequate width to meet building setback requirements from both abutting streets.
(Ord. No. 291, § 1202, 1-21-2016)
Sec. 30-269. - Building lines.
A building line of not less than 30 feet from the street right-of-way shall be established on all lots.
(Ord. No. 291, § 1203, 1-21-2016)
Sec. 30-270. - Double and reverse frontage lots.

(Ord. No. 291, § 1204, 1-21-2016)
Sec. 30-271. - Percolation tests.
Before determining the lot sizes, where there is no existing sewer system, the county health department shall be consulted so that percolation tests of the soil can be made. If percolation does not meet minimum standards, lot sizes must be increased as required by the health department so official approval can be given for septic tanks.
(Ord. No. 291, § 1205, 1-21-2016)
Sec. 30-272. - Visible public utilities.
All public utilities which are visible must be placed in the rear yard as close to rear lot lines as practicable.

ARTICLE XII. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS

Sec. 30-293. - Enumerated.
Every subdivider shall plan for and provide the following street improvements and utilities, which must be approved by the city engineer:
(1)
Street grading, extruded concrete curbs, and street base and paving, except on major or limited access streets. Street base and paving requirements by the city are as follows:
a.
Six-inch water-bound base.
b.
Two inches of asphaltic concrete surface course.
Other material of equal quality may be accepted if prior written approval of the planning commission is given.
(2)
Water mains within the subdivision with connections to each lot must be certified by the city's engineer. Such mains must have a minimum diameter of six inches and further must conform to any additional requirements to provide proper pressure, volume and flow of water to fire hydrants as determined by the utility furnishing the water supply. All utilities to be installed in the streets shall be placed and compacted prior to paving.
(3)
Extruded concrete curbs must conform to standard drawings submitted by the subdivider and approved by the city engineer.
(4)
Fire hydrants must be placed on the rights-of-way so that no point of any lot is more than 1,000 feet from a hydrant.
(Ord. No. 291, § 1301, 1-21-2016)
Sec. 30-294. - Drainage.
(a)
An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipe culverts, catch basins, and bridges shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water. Cross drains shall be of sufficient length to permit full roadway width and the required slopes. The drainage structure sizes are to be determined by the Manning Formula, but in no case shall a cross drain be less than 15 inches in diameter. The highway department shall be consulted before any drains are installed to ensure they will conform to the formula as to proper size.
(b)
Cross drains shall be built on straight line and grade and shall be laid on a firm compacted base. In the event rock is encountered in the trench, the rock shall be removed four inches below the grade and replaced with suitable material. Pipe shall be laid with the spigot end pointing in the direction of flow and with ends fitted and matched to provide tight joints and a smooth uniform invert made by grouping tile of 24-inch diameter or larger halfway up the pipe on the inside and halfway down on the outside.
(c)
All cross drains and driveway tile shall have concrete headwalls as shown on drawings approved by the city engineer. Wingwalls of a corresponding design shall be provided as needed.
(d)
When necessary for proper flow, inlet and outlet ditches shall be provided at drainage structures and drainage easements shall be shown on side and rear lines.
(e)
Treatment of the inlet and outlet ditches and all drainage ways in the subdivision shall conform to the following table, and in all cases, be constructed on a firm base.
EXPAND
Size of Nearest Culvert Treatment
Upstream Seeded Sod
15 inches Grades 3 — 10 percent Grades exceeding 10 percent
18 inches, 24 inches Grades 1.5 percent — 7.0 percent Grades exceeding 7.0 percent
30 inches, 36 inches Grades 1.0 percent — 4.0 percent Grades exceeding 4.0 percent
42 inches, 60 inches Grades 2.5 percent — or less Grades exceeding 2.5 percent
  (f)
Swales or ditch lines paralleling the roadway shall be graded a minimum of one percent where possible, and in no case will grades of less than 0.5 percent be allowed. Where at all possible, main drainage ways shall be cut to the rear of lot lines and not carried down the roadway.
(g)
If a drainage pipe is under 30 inches in diameter, located in the ditch line, and more than 100 feet long, concrete or solid masonry catch basins with a six-inch minimum wall thickness shall be required at intervals of 100 feet or at lot lines, whichever is less. The design of these catch basins shall conform to drawings approved by the city engineer.
(h)
Where there are long grades, relief pipes shall be placed. The maximum interval of relief pipes shall be 500 feet.
(i)
Should a bridge or large drainage structure be required to provide proper drainage, it shall be designed by a licensed civil engineer and approved by the city engineer.
(j)
Before any preliminary or final subdivision plat is approved, the subdivider must submit plans and specifications demonstrating that the proposed subdivision, when developed, will be in full compliance with all laws of the state and all ordinances of the city pertaining to stormwater runoff, illicit discharges, and soil erosion and sedimentation. The subdivider must likewise obtain all permits required by the state and/or the city pertaining to stormwater runoff, illicit discharges, and soil erosion and sedimentation. To help defray the added stormwater management costs which the city will incur as a result of the development of the subdivision, the subdivider will pay to the city, prior to the approval of each preliminary plat, a stormwater impact fee in such amount as may from time to time be established by the city council.
