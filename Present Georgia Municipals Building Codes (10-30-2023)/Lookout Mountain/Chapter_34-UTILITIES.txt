Such notice shall be mailed to the user by certified mail, return receipt requested, or shall be personally delivered to the user at least 20 days prior to the proposed action, except in the event of an emergency. Such mailing or delivery may be made either to the user's last-known address as shown on the city's tax records or to the address of the property in question. At the show cause hearing, the user may present any defense he may have to such charges, either in person or through submission of written or documentary proof. Following such hearing or opportunity for a hearing, the city manager or superintendent may, in his discretion, order the termination of sewer service if satisfied from all the proof available that the violation was willful and the termination is necessary to abate the offending condition, or to prevent future violations. The city manager or superintendent may terminate service for a period not to exceed one year for a willful violation and may terminate service indefinitely to abate offending conditions or prevent future violations, subject to the correction of such conditions or violations by the user.
(b)
Emergency termination of service. If, in the opinion of the city manager or superintendent, it appears that such violation presents or may present an emergency situation endangering the public health, the environment, sewer system personnel, or the operation of the system, he may take immediate action to abate the condition and terminate service. In the event such emergency action adversely affects the user, the city manager or superintendent shall provide the user an opportunity for a hearing as soon as practicable thereafter to consider restoration of service upon abatement of the condition or other reasonable conditions. Following the hearing, the city manager or superintendent may take any such action authorized by subsection (c) of this section should the proof warrant such action.
(c)
Water service. Any violation of this article which is not corrected or abated following a notice and opportunity for a hearing shall be grounds for the termination of water service and/or plugging the sewer line, and the city may, in addition, pursue all other rights and remedies provided by this article or applicable law (including both statutory and common law).

The sewer service charges shall become effective upon water usage, shall be at the rates and other fees and charges hereinafter imposed, and shall be billed by the water company or by any other private or governmental entity with which the city may contract for sewer billing services. Such sewer charges shall be paid within 18 days after the issuance of the bill. If charges are not paid within said 18-day period, they shall be considered delinquent, and the city may, in addition to other available remedies, provide notice to the water company under applicable state law that water service to the customer is to be suspended.
(b)
Sewer service charges shall be billed as a separate designated item on the bills issued by the water company or other billing service provider.
(c)
Billing shall begin and the sewer service charges shall become payable upon the property owner's or occupant's connection to the city's sewer system or within 180 days after the city manager's or superintendent's issuance of notice pursuant to section 34-22(a) that sewer service is available for the property, whichever occurs first. Consistent with section 34-59, all owners or occupants to whom sewer service is available shall be billed for the sewer service charges regardless of whether they have elected to connect to the city's sewer system.
(Ord. No. 187, § 2-5, 1-21-1999; Ord. No. 267, § 3, 12-20-2012)
Sec. 34-64. - Schedule.
(a)
Sewer service charges; quantity of water used. Sewer service charges shall be based upon the quantity of water used as shown by water meter readings and shall be the dollar amount derived by applying monetary rates per gallon, cubic foot or other measure to the quantities of water used. The rates per gallon, cubic foot, or other measure of water used shall be established from time to time by the city council and may be different for different quantities of water used.
(b)
Additional monthly service charges. In addition to the sewer service charges based on the quantity of water used as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, each owner or occupant of a residential (both single-family and multifamily), commercial, institutional, tourist or church-related property which is obligated to pay sewer service charges pursuant to section 34-60 or pursuant to any contract or agreement with the city shall pay a monthly service charge in the amount determined from time to time by the city council for each lot or parcel of residential real estate and for each commercial, institutional, tourist or church-related establishment for which sewer service is provided or available.
(Ord. No. 187, § 2-6, 1-21-1999; Ord. No. 267, § 4, 12-20-2012; Ord. No. 300, § 1, 1-19-2017)
Sec. 34-65. - Minimum charges.
Minimum sewer service charges shall be as determined by the city council from time to time.
(Ord. No. 187, § 2-7, 1-21-1999)
Sec. 34-66. - Designation of water accounts to be charged.
The city manager or superintendent shall designate and report to the water company the water service accounts which shall be billed for sewer service charges, and shall furnish the water company serving the user with the rates, as they may be changed from time to time, to be charged for sewer services. This designation and report shall include all properties for which sewer service has been provided by the city. In the event of the extension of the city's sewer system to any property not now served by sewers, the city manager or superintendent shall immediately notify the water company serving the user of the additional account to be billed for sewer service.
(Ord. No. 187, § 2-8, 1-21-1999)
Sec. 34-67. - Charges where water usage not metered.
(a)
Generally. The owner or occupant of property obtaining water from a source other than through a meter of the water company which is discharged into the city's sewers shall install, without cost to the city, a meter to measure the quantity of water received from such source or the quantity of sewage generated by such source, and shall pay the same rates as provided in sections 34-64 and 34-65. No meter shall be installed or used for such purpose without the approval of the city manager or superintendent. If the owner of such property fails to install an approved meter, the city manager or superintendent shall make an estimate of the quantity of such water used by such property owner and discharged into the city's sewers from the property, and the owner or occupant of the property shall be liable to the city for the sewer service charges due, which may be collected by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(b)
Multi-unit complexes. To provide more equality between single-family and multi-unit dwellings (with just one or less number of water meters than the total number of dwelling units in the complex), sewer service charges to multi-unit apartment complexes or other multi-unit establishments served by master meters or any combination of meters totaling less than the number of units served shall be charged by the following formula:
U[adj] x S[c] x O[c]
Where:
U[adj] = U[tot] / O[c]
U[tot] = Total usage of individual meter or master meter.
O[c] = The number of units served by the referenced meter, times a 90 percent occupancy rate.
S[c] = The service charge as detailed in sections 34-64 and 34-65.
(Ord. No. 187, § 2-9, 1-21-1999)
Sec. 34-68. - Consumers not to be charged sewer user charges for water used for commercial purposes not discharged into city sewers.
(a)
Secondary metering. Whenever a property upon which a sewer user charge is imposed under this article uses water for commercial purposes, which water so used is not discharged into the sewerage system of the city, the quantity of water so used and not discharged into the city's sewers shall be excluded in determining the sewer user charge of the owner or occupant, provided that the quantity of water so used and not discharged into the city sewers is measured by a device or meter (called a secondary meter) approved by the city manager or superintendent and installed by the owner or occupant without cost to the city. The sewer user charge based upon the consumption of water to be paid by the owner or occupant of such property shall be computed at the rates provided in this article, less the quantity not discharged into the city's sewers. The city reserves the right to require calibration of secondary meters when appropriate. A secondary meter shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
Meters should read in 100 cubic feet.
(2)
Meters must be located either in an outdoor meter box or vault, or inside the customer's building or structure in a clean, dry, safe place not subject to wide temperature variations so that the meter can be easily examined, read and removed.
(3)
The customer shall, at his expense, provide suitable pipe connections and shut-off valves, one each at the inlet and outlet sides of the meter.
(4)
The meter box or vault may be constructed to protect the meter from freezing and damage by vehicular traffic, and its location and design shall prevent, as far as possible, the inflow of surface water.
(5)
Any changes in location of secondary meters, malfunctions, replacements or any other changes in the approved secondary meter installation must be reported to the city manager or superintendent in writing. Also, a copy must be forwarded to the water company containing all pertinent information regarding that particular meter.
(6)
No retroactive credits will be issued, if the holder of the secondary meter permit fails to comply with the rules and regulations in force at any particular time.
(7)
If any water exempted from the sewer service charge is returned to the sewer system at any time or point, a metering device shall be installed. Any flow registered through such a meter shall be charged for sewer service.
(8)
Any secondary meter must be easily accessible by the water company. If this is not possible, remote-read meters shall be installed and be protected from any magnetic interference. It is the responsibility of the permit holder to ensure the accuracy of the remote read to the installed meter.
(9)
All meters must be calibrated and certified for accuracy once every 18 months. The certification of the inspection, or a copy thereof, must be forwarded to the city manager or superintendent.
(b)
Other sewer user charge credits. User charge credits may also be given by the city manager or superintendent for the following purposes:
(1)
Hidden or underground leaks;
(2)
Catastrophic leaks where water does not enter the sewer line;
(3)
Where secondary meters are installed for swimming pools, lawn or garden watering, sprinkler systems, and other processes where water is used but not returned to the sewer;
(4)
Filling a swimming pool will be allowed one credit per year for the initial fill if the water is not returned to the sewer at the end of the swimming season.
No sewer user may receive a credit for an amount which would reduce the resultant sewer bill below the minimum charge required by section 34-65. To be considered for credit, leaks must be reported to the water company, and corrected by the owner or occupant without cost to the city. The sewer user charge based upon the consumption of water to be paid by the owner or occupant of such property shall be computed at the rates provided in this article, less the quantity not discharged into the city's sewers.
(Ord. No. 187, § 2-10, 1-21-1999)
Sec. 34-69. - Appeals.
A user may contest a credit or billing determination by the city manager or superintendent by paying said bill under protest, and, within 30 days following the due date of said bill, lodging with the city manager or superintendent a notice of appeal with the city council. The appeal shall follow the procedures established by or for the city council or otherwise provided by applicable state or local law.
(Ord. No. 187, § 2-11, 1-21-1999)
Sec. 34-70. - Miscellaneous fees.
(a)
Applicability. There shall be and are hereby levied miscellaneous fees to be collected by the city manager or superintendent for various purposes relating to this chapter as set forth in this section. Such fees shall include the fees for garbage grinders set forth in subsection (b) of this section as well as other fees that may, from time to time, be established by the city council by ordinance or resolution.

Fees for garbage grinders. Any user of a garbage grinder, except users in a premises used exclusively for an individual residence, shall be charged at a rate determined from time to time by the city council.

Appointments and vacancies. Original appointments to the board will be for the following terms: one city resident and the Covenant College and Brow Wood representatives on the board will be appointed for a term of four years; one city resident will be appointed for a term of three years; one city resident will be appointed for a term of two years; and one city resident will be appointed for a term of one year. Subsequent appointments will be for terms of four years each. All resident and nonresident members of the board may, in the sole discretion of the city council, be reappointed to successive terms, or the city council may, in its sole discretion, choose to appoint different members. A vacancy on the board will occur if a board member resigns, dies, is physically or mentally unable to serve, is convicted of a felony or malfeasance in office, or accepts any federal, state, county, or other municipal office. A vacancy will also occur if one of the four resident members of the board ceases to be a resident of the city.
