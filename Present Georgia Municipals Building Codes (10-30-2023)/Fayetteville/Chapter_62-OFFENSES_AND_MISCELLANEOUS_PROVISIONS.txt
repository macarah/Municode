Sec. 62-18. - Social hosting.
(a)
Purpose. The city council desires to protect the health, safety and welfare of all persons living in and visiting the city. The use of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 is prohibited by Georgia law and under the City of Fayetteville Code of Ordinances. This section prohibits and establishes penalties for any person hosting an event or gathering where alcohol is present and being possessed or consumed by persons under 21 years of age.
(b)
Findings. The city council intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The city council finds that:
(1)
Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement.
(2)
Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions. Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user.
(3)
Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present and, condone the activity, and in some circumstances provide the alcohol.
(4)
An ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption. A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs.
(c)

(1)
Alcohol means ethyl alcohol, hydrated oxide of ethyl, or spirits of wine, from whatever source or by whatever process produced.

b.
The person fails to take reasonable steps to prevent possession or consumption by the underage person(s).
(2)
