Sec. 2-311. - Objectives and purchasing principles.
(a)
Objectives.
(1)
To conduct city business in such an open manner that potential vendors will be impressed by the fairness of the system and thus be encouraged to furnish competition which will ensure that the city will secure the best product at the lowest price at all times.
(2)
To encourage competitive purchasing.
(3)
To develop and maintain an adequate supply of materials, services and supplies as required.
(4)
To give due consideration to ethical and quality standards and also to real value rather than price alone.

To establish and build good relations with suppliers and departments.
(6)
To discourage, as far as possible, any procedure other than that of competitive purchasing.
(7)
To purchase the highest quality in supplies, equipment and contractual services at the least expense.
(8)
To encourage cooperative/collaborative purchasing with other governmental agencies. This process provides discounting through combining the "purchasing power" of local entities to achieve economics of scale associated with this type relationship.
(b)
Purchasing principles. The following principles are to apply to the procurement of materials, services and supplies:
(1)
Materials, services and supplies are to be purchased only when monies for their cost have been appropriated in the annual budget for the city.

(3)
Materials, services and supplies not available through State of Georgia, D.O.A.S. or under state contract are to be purchased according to the procedures in section 2-314.
(4)
All other considerations being equal, bids shall be awarded on price, service and delivery. Bid items must meet specifications in all cases to qualify. The city has the right to accept or reject any and all bids as long as that right is not exercised in violation of O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 91.
(5)
Whenever possible long-term contracts should be obtained for supplying commodities such as gasoline or other items for which monthly or periodic requirements can be forecast. The purchasing department shall make periodic checks to assure that the party under contract is not escalating his delivery price beyond current market.
(6)
Request for quotation, as well as sealed bids, should have a set time, date and location given by the purchasing department when tabulation of bids will be made and this shall be done at the time and date specified.
(7)
Emergency purchases are the result of breakdown in equipment or other occurrences for which it is impossible to plan in advance. For emergency purchases of $5,000.00 or less: If the occasion arises during the hours of normal operation contact the purchasing agent and he/she may make the purchase or authorize the department head to do so. If an emergency arises after hours the department head will make the purchase and contact the purchasing agent the next working day and immediately send a memorandum explaining the emergency. Emergency purchases exceeding $5,000.00: Approval of the purchasing agent and city manager shall be obtained prior to any purchase.

Departments should assist the purchasing agent by suggesting the names of vendors that have access to particular items being requested, especially items of a technical nature.

(c)
The city is not obligated to purchase equipment or accessories that are delivered for use on a "trial" basis.
(d)
Department heads will be called upon to assist in writing specifications for bids. Specifications should not be written which are considered "closed" (written around one specific brand).

However, the wording "or approved equal" will always be added so as not to discriminate against any vendors merchandise. Competition must be kept in mind throughout the writing of specifications.
