SECTION 12. - AMENDMENT

12-1 - General Conditions.
These regulations, including the official Land Use districts map, may be amended by the Board of Commissioners on their own motion, on petition of a property owner or this duly authorized agent, or on recommendation of the Planning Commission, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall first have been submitted to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation. Before enacting an amendment to these regulations, the governing authority shall give public notice and hold a public hearing thereon as set forth in this section.
12-1.1
Establishment of Comprehensive Plan. The 2016 Greater Brantley Comprehensive Plan, as duly amended, is established as official policy of Brantley County. As such, the goals and policies of the Plan, and the resultant Future Land Use Plan, shall serve as the guide under which the unincorporated areas of the county are divided into Land Use districts. The recommendations of the Plan are hereby established as official policy of the county, and shall receive due consideration in all Land Use districts reclassification requests.
12-1.2
Limited Use Provision. The Brantley County Board of Commissioners establishes the Limited Use provision for the purpose of allowing an applicant to request that a certain area be designated as a limited use. In some areas of the county, a specific land use activity out of a general Land Use classification may have less community impact than some of the possibilities of use in that specific Land Use district. For this reason, an applicant may request in his development petition to limit the use of a proposed property to a specified use only. The requested limited use must be among the uses permitted in the Land Use district classification for which the limited use is requested. Alteration or change of an approved limited use shall be treated as any normal Land Use amendment.
12-1.3
Special Conditions Limitations. An applicant may file site plans, renderings, construction specifications, written development restrictions and other site planning or development conditions which the applicant proposes as binding conditions upon the development and use of the property involved in the application. Should the application be approved with these conditions, any alteration or change of special conditions limitation shall be treated as any normal Land Use district amendment.
12-2 - Application for Amendment.
12-2.1

12-2.6
Developments of Regional Impact. The Georgia Department of Community Affairs, pursuant to the Georgia Planning Act, has established criteria for the identification of certain large-scale developments which have the potential to cause land use impacts beyond the boundaries of the respective local government where a project might be proposed. These developments, known as Developments of Regional Impact (DRIs), shall be submitted, based on established DCA standards, procedures, and format, to the Southern Georgia Regional Commission (SGRC) for review and recommendation prior to any Planning Commission or Brantley County Commission action.

12-2.8
Hearing Procedures.
A)
Hearing Called: Before taking action on a proposed Land Use amendment, the Board of Commissioners shall hold a public hearing thereon. At least fifteen, (15) but not more than forty-five (45) days' notice of the time, place, and purpose of said hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within Brantley County, Georgia at least (2) consecutive issues. Such notice shall also state the application number and date, and shall contain a summary of the proposed amendment, if a text amendment, and in the case of a map amendment, the location of the property, its area, the name of the owner or their authorized agent, and the present and proposed Land Use classification or Special Exception use for the property affected.

Such disclosure shall be required to be filed at least five (5) calendar days prior to the scheduled hearing.

Notice to Interested Parties: A notice shall be given to the applicant and the Planning Commission of the date, time, and place of the public hearing. All application files shall be placed in the custody of the Land Use Administrator (County Manager) and be open to public inspection during regular office hours.
C)
Letters: As to an application to amend the Official Land Use Districts Map or a Special Exception request, the Land Use Administrator (County Manager) shall send letters to abutting property owners at least fifteen (15) days and no more than forty-five (45) days in advance of the Public Hearing before the County Commission. Letters shall include information as to the nature of the application and the date, time, and place of the public hearing.
D)
Public Hearing Procedure: All public hearings on Land Use matters shall be placed on the County Commission agenda under a section entitled "Public Hearings". The County Commission Chairman, or [his] designee, shall officially declare the public hearing open and shall note that Brantley County's written Public Hearing Procedures, Brantley County's Standards for Exercise of Land Use Powers, and a copy of Georgia's Conflict of Interest Law are available to the attending public as a handout and are posted for public review.
The Land Use Administrator (County Manager) and/or designee shall then announce the matter for consideration. The Chairman shall then call for acknowledgment of a potential conflict of interest by members of the Commission. The Land Use Administrator (County Manager) will then report the staff recommendation and the recommendation of the Greater Brantley Planning Commission. The Chairman shall then allow public input. General procedures to be followed will require citizen comments to be heard in an orderly fashion. Citizens speaking in favor of the request shall be heard first, followed by those opposed to the issue. All speakers will be asked to provide his or her name and address for the public record. Citizens are requested to keep their comments as brief as possible so that all who wish to be heard will have adequate time. Where there is a large number of citizens wishing to testify at a given hearing, the presiding officer may invoke reasonable time limitations on both the proponents and opponents of a request. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to both sides of an issue equally, such minimum time period to be no less than ten minutes per side. Citizens shall address their comments to the County Commission as a whole. Individual attacks or cross examination of Commission members, county employees or other citizens will be ruled out of order. The Commission retains the privilege to ask any questions of staff or any citizen present for clarification.
After all citizen comments have been received, all further discussion of the specific application is reserved for the County Commission. The Chairman shall then declare the public hearing closed and no further public comment will be entertained. The County Commission will then render a decision on the application. So that the purpose of this Ordinance will be served, health, public safety, and general welfare secured, the County Commission may approve the application, reduce the land area for which the application is made, change the district requested, add or delete conditions of the application, deny an application, or defer consideration of an application to acquire additional information. An action by the Commission to defer the application shall include a statement of the date and time of the next meeting at which the application will be considered, which statement shall constitute public notice of the hearing on the application and no further notice is required. IN THE CASE OF TABLING OF A MATTER, NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS WILL BE ENTERTAINED UPON FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE MATTER.
When, in the opinion of the County Commission, the official public hearing has brought forth substantial new evidence or testimony not available to the Greater Brantley Planning Commission at the time of their review of a Land Use matter, or should the Commission desire to request further study by the Planning Commission of a particular aspect of an application, it shall be the policy of the Commission to table the issue and request that the Planning Commission restudy the issue and affirm or amend its recommendation, which action shall be reported to the County Commission prior to making a final decision.
E)
Standards for Exercise of Land Use Powers: In order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of Brantley County against the unrestricted use of property, the following standards, and other factors relevant to balancing the above stated public interests shall be considered as they apply to any application brought before the Planning Commission or the County Commission for a Land Use decision:
1)
Is the proposed Land Use or use suitable in view of the Land Use and development of adjacent and nearby property?
2)
Does the request represent the possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts and will the proposed use adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property?
3)
Will the proposed use cause an excessive or burdensome use of public facilities or services, including but not limited to streets, schools, water, sewer, or other public utilities, including police and fire protection?
4)
Is the proposed use supported by new or changing conditions not anticipated by the Comprehensive Plan or is the proposed use compatible and consistent with the purpose and intent of the Comprehensive Plan?
5)
Will the proposed change adversely influence existing conditions in the neighborhood or the city or county at large and are there substantial reasons why the property cannot or should not be used as currently districted?
6)
Are there potential adverse impacts on the environment, including but not limited to drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality, and water quality and quantity?
7)
Are the costs required of the public in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public utilities, schools, streets and public safety necessities reasonable when considering the proposed changes?
8)
Will the proposed change be detrimental to the value or improvement of development of adjacent or nearby property in accordance with existing requirements and development standards?
9)
Is the proposed change out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood or Brantley County or does the request reflect a reasonable balance between the promotion of the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare and the right to unrestricted use of property?
10)
Will the proposed change constitute a grant of special privilege to the individual owner as contrasted with the adjacent or nearby neighborhood or with the general public?
F)
Standards for Special Exception Review: In addition to the standards enumerated in subsection (e) above, the following additional standards shall be considered for Special Exception requests:
1)
Is the type of street providing access to the use adequate to serve the proposed Special Exception use?
2)
Is access into and out of the property adequate to provide for traffic and pedestrian safety, the anticipated volume of traffic flow, and to allow access by emergency vehicles?
3)
Are public facilities such as schools, water, sewer or other public utilities and police and fire protection adequate to serve the proposed Special Exception use?
4)
Are refuse, service parking and loading areas on the property located or screened to protect other properties in the area from such adverse effects as noise, light glare and other negative impacts?
5)
Will the hours and manner of operation of the Special Exception use have no adverse impacts on other properties in the area?
6)
Will the height, size or location of the buildings or other structures on the property be compatible with the height, size or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties?
In addition to the general factors articulated above for Special Exception uses, the following factors shall be specifically considered by the Planning Commission and the County Commission with respect to all "Solid Waste, Inert" facilities and all "Solid waste, sanitary, waste energy" facilities (as defined in Section 2-1):
1)
Is the proposed Special Exception use consistent with the Brantley County, City of Hoboken, and City of Nahunta Solid Waste Management Plan including, but not limited to, all siting factors and related restrictions? Will the proposed use have any negative effect on the County's solid waste management program?
2)
Will the disposal site be located on a State Highway for ingress and egress, and would the site create traffic through any primarily residential area?
3)
What is the proximity of the site to:
a)
Any protected river corridors or any lake or river or "state waters" as defined by O.C.G.A. § 12-7-3(16), as may be amended from time to time;
b)
Any wetlands;
c)
Any public or private water supply wells;
d)
Any cultural or historical site or place (including, but not limited to, National historic sites or places, such as the Sylvester Mumford House and the Brantley County Courthouse, and/or historical markers listed by the Georgia Historical Society);

Any schools or religious places of worship;
f)
Any adjacent or nearby residential dwellings or residentially zoned districts;
g)
Any private or public airports within Brantley County;
h)
Any municipalities not participating in the Brantley County, City of Hoboken, and City of Nahunta Solid Waste Management Plan?
4)
Would the Special Exception use be detrimental or injurious to the enjoyment, use, or development of adjacent or nearby properties, or to the general community? If so, would the benefits of and need for the proposed use be greater than any possible depreciating effects and damages to the neighboring properties?
5)
Would the Special Exception use create a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such a facility, vehicular movement, noise, fumes, or odors generated, or type of physical activity?
6)
Will the hours and manner of operation of the Special Exception use have adverse impacts on other properties in the area?
7)
Is the parcel of land on which the Special Exception use is proposed to be established of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of the use?
8)
Does the property have other reasonably economically viable uses that would be less injurious to the neighborhood?
Provided that the County Commission may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood; and provided that wherever the County Commission shall find in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations that any term, condition or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, said County Commission shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
Special Exception approval granted by the County Commission shall be valid for a period of three years. If the applicant fails to begin the Special Exception use within this three-year period, the County's approval shall become null and void. However, upon written motion of the applicant to the County at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the three-year period, the County may extend the three-year period where warranted in light of all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the size and phasing of the development, substantial financial expenditures, economic cycles, and market conditions. Such extension shall be by unanimous vote of the County Commission following a public hearing. The County shall publish a notice of the public hearing in the official County legal organ at least 15 days and no more than 45 days prior to said public hearing and in that same time period shall cause certified letters to be sent to all property owners and residents within one mile of the application property including the date, time and place of the public hearing.
G)
Public Hearings Records Standards: The County Clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of all Land Use public hearings. If requested by any party, verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be prepared, but only if requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party, who must arrange at his expense for a certified court reporter to record and transcribe the hearing and furnish the original of the transcript to the commission for its records. The record of the public hearing and all evidence (e.g., maps, drawings, traffic studies, etc.) submitted at the public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular Land Use amendment file.
H)
Conflict of Interest and Disclosure Rules: Any Brantley County Commissioner or Planning Commission member shall refrain from discussion of or voting upon any Land Use matter where the following exist:
1)
Has any direct ownership in any real property to be affected by a Land Use action under consideration by Brantley County Government; or
2)
Has a ten percent (10%) or more direct ownership interest in the total assets or capital stock in any business entity which has any direct ownership in any real property affected by a Land Use action under consideration by Brantley County Government; or
3)
Has a spouse, parent, sibling or child with any interest as described in items 1 and 2 above shall disclose the nature and extent of such interest, in writing, to the Brantley County Commission as soon as he or she knows of its existence. Such an official, which shall include members of the County Commission, or Planning Commission also shall disqualify himself/herself from voting on the Land Use action and shall not take any other action on behalf of himself or herself or anyone else to influence action on the Land Use proposal. Any written disclosures made pursuant to this section which result in the inability of the County Commission to obtain a quorum for the purpose of making a final decision when considering a Land Use action, the County Commission shall initiate the special master process set forth in O.C.G.A. §36-67a-5, as amended. Moreover, questions of interpretation as to the application of this statute should be resolved by reference to the Georgia state law governing campaign contribution disclosures, O.C.G.A. §36-57-1 et seq, as amended.
