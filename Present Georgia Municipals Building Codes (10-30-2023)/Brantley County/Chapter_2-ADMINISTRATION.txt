DIVISION 2. - CODE OF CONDUCT[4]

--- (4) ---
Editor's note— A resolution adopted May 13, 2008, §§ 1—3, did not specify manner of inclusion; hence, codification as div. 2, §§ 2-41—2-43.

Sec. 2-41. - Commissioner's conduct during meetings.
During the public portions of public meetings and public hearings, members of the Brantley County Board of Commissioners shall not:
(1)
Speak without first being recognized by the chair;
(2)
Interrupt anyone who has the floor;
(3)
Use profanity during the public portion of any meeting;
(4)
Refuse to yield the floor, or argue with the chair, if he is ruled out of order by the chair;
(5)
Make disparaging remarks about any person's character during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to say "I don't believe that" or "I cannot accept that," but it is improper to say "He's a liar," or "He can't be trusted." Remarks should be limited to the subject under discussion, and shall not address the character of the person involved. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session.
(6)
Confront anyone about a prior statement in an accusatory manner during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask someone if something different had been said on a prior occasion, and the question should be phrased "Did you tell me _______?" or "Do you remember telling me _______" It is impermissible to say "Didn't you tell me _______?" or "Why did you tell me _______ before the meeting?" The purpose of the public portion of a commissioner's meeting is to allow each commissioner, county representative and members of the public to state their positions in an orderly fashion; it is not a trial where persons are to be cross examined, interrogated, belittled or held out for public ridicule or embarrassment. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session.
(7)
State during the public portion of any meeting that a county employee has not done his or her job, or has not done his or her job properly. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask if a county employee did or did not do a specific task, but the question must be phrased in such a way that a simple "yes" or "no" answer is all that is requested. It would also be permissible to state or comment that a job was not done, or that it was not done correctly, so long as the person responsible is not singled-out for blame; remarks concerning the subject or job performance are proper but negative references to the person responsible are not. It is not proper to accuse county employees of not doing their jobs, or doing them improperly, during the public portion of the meetings. County employees shall not be placed in the position of responding to accusations of wrongdoing by a commissioner during the public portion of a meeting (unless the meeting has been called as a hearing for the express purpose of determining disciplinary action), nor shall their integrity or competency be challenged by a commissioner during the public portion of any meeting. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate or these matters in executive closed session.
(8)
Represent their personal position or beliefs as being the position or beliefs of the board as a whole. By way of example, unless and until a majority vote has been obtained on a specific issue, a commissioner shall not state that the board will or will not do something, nor shall a commissioner state what the board's vote will be on an issue. No single commissioner can speak on behalf of the board unless specifically authorized by majority vote to do so.
(9)
Refuse to recognize the validity of action approved by a majority vote of the board. By way of example, a commissioner is free to state that he does not agree with the majority vote, or that he would like to see the majority reconsider its action and vote a different way. However, a commissioner shall not refuse to sign any ordinance, resolution, contract or other legal document because he did not vote for the action taken. The minutes shall reflect his opposition to the majority's decision, but he shall not be authorized to withhold his signature on the basis that he did not vote for the action taken.
(10)
Divulge the subject matter of any confidential information, legal advice or strategy discussions revealed during an executive session called for the purpose of discussing actual or potential litigation against the county or any county employee. There may be occasions when a commissioner will be asked to make specific commitment to this rule in connection with a particular case. If a commissioner is unwilling to pledge his commitment to the other members of the board, he shall be excluded from participating in that portion of the executive session.
(Res. of 5-13-2008, § 1)
Sec. 2-42. - Commissioner's conduct outside of meetings.
A member of the Brantley County Board of Commissioners shall not:
(1)
Direct any department head or county employee to do a job or perform a task. All such requests shall be made to the county manager. Once such a request is made, the commissioners shall follow-up with the county manager regarding the performance of the work, not with the department head or county employee whom the commissioner expects to do the job. If the job is not performed to the commissioner's satisfaction, this shall be taken up with the county manager first; if the commissioner is still not satisfied, the matter shall next be discussed with all members of the board of commissioners in executive session, under the exemption to the Open Meetings Act for discussion of employee performance. There shall be no criticism or disparaging remarks made about any county employee in a public meeting unless and until all of these steps have been exhausted.
(2)
Publicly state that he intends to fire or discipline any county employee. No single commissioner has the authority to hire or fire county personnel.
(3)
Reprimand any county employee. If a commissioner believes a county employee should be reprimanded, he shall so inform the county manager. If a commissioner believes the county manager should be reprimanded, he shall notify the other members of the board of commissioners. No single commissioner has the authority to discipline county personnel.
(4)
Use profanity, insulting or demeaning words about a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee.
(5)
Call into question the qualifications or competency of a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee. Concern of this nature shall be addressed in the stages outlined in subsection (1) of this section.
(6)
Demand that the county manager or any department head stop what he or she is doing and immediately attend to the commissioner's business. If the county manager or a department head requests that the commissioner schedule a time to discuss a matter that is mutually convenient to all concerned, the commissioner shall honor that request.
(7)
Promise on behalf of the county or the board of commissioners to undertake any act or to pass any ordinance, resolution, contract or agreement. A single commissioner has no authority to bind the board of commissioners.
(8)
Agree to buy or sell anything of value on behalf of the county without advance approval by a majority vote of the board of commissioners.
(9)
Attempt to negotiate county business with any private party or a representative of another governmental unit without the advance approval of a majority of the board of commissioners. By way of example, it is permissible for a commissioner to discuss county business in general terms with private parties and representatives of other governmental units (unless there is actual or threatened litigation against Brantley County by the parties involved). However, a commissioner shall not make any written offers, draft any agreements, edit or revise any proposed agreements or plans or suggest or propose (whether orally or in writing) any specific terms concerning money or services to be provided or received by the county unless that commissioner has received expressed authorization in advance by a majority vote of the board of commissioners. Should commissioners be elected by districts, the fact that the subject matter involves property or persons in a commissioner's district is of no consequence, as a commissioner has no additional legal authority over a matter simply because it is in his district.
(10)
Speak to any representatives of the news media on behalf of the county or the board of commissioners without advance approval by majority vote of the board of commissioners. By way of example, a commissioner is free to express his personal views or opinions to anyone. However, a commissioner shall not make a statement in the name of the board of commissioners or in the name of Brantley County unless he has been authorized in advance to do so by majority vote of the board of commissioners.
(Res. of 5-13-2008, § 2)
Sec. 2-43. - Penalties for commissioner violating code of conduct.
(a)
The board of commissioners shall have the responsibility to police itself and to enforce this code of conduct. Any commissioner shall have the right to bring a suspected violation of this code of conduct to the attention of the full board. Any such accusation may be deliberated upon in executive session, but a vote upon any penalty to be imposed must be taken in open, public session, with all members of the board present. If the board determines by majority vote that a violation of this code of conduct has occurred, the board shall have the authority to impose one or more of the following penalties upon the offending commissioner:
(1)
A verbal censure that shall be noted in the minutes without further elaboration;
(2)
A written censure, to be made a part of the minutes, specifically outlining the facts underlying the violation;
(3)
Removal of the commissioner from membership on any committee, association or group in which the offending commissioner is involved in his capacity as a Brantley County commissioner; removal shall take place by the delivery of a letter, signed by the board of commissioners, to the head of such committee, association or group, stating that the offending commissioner is no longer authorized to represent Brantley County. The sanction shall last for a period of up to one year from the date of the offense.
(4)
A fine, not to exceed $500.00 per offense, which shall be paid by the offending commissioner to the general fund of Brantley County, Georgia, within ten days of the board's vote establishing a violation; if the offending commissioner fails to make this payment within the time specified herein, the amount of the penalty shall be withheld from the offending commissioner's compensation as a commissioner.
(b)
The decision of the Brantley County Board of Commissioners on any question concerning a violation of this code of conduct or the penalty imposed, shall be final, it being the express intent of all the commissioners to govern themselves, and not to abdicate this responsibility to any other person or entity.

The purpose and intent of this policy is to establish guidelines for employees who engage in social media activity as defined herein. This policy is not intended to prohibit any employee's personal expression in general or through social media activity in particular; however, because such activity can adversely affect county board of Commissioners' operations, as well as undermine public trust and confidence, regulation of social media activity by employees of the county board of commissioners is determined by the said board of commissioners to be necessary for the more efficient operation of the board's duties and responsibilities to its citizens and the public it serves. This policy attempts to balance employees' interest in engaging in social media activity and the county board of commissioners' interest in preventing unnecessary interference with its operations and relationship to the public it serves.
