ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 66-1. - Road abandonment guidelines.
(a)
Application. Application for county road or easement closing/abandonment shall be made to the county clerk on an application provided by Brantley County. The applicant shall outline the nature of the request and specify the anticipated follow-on use of the road or easement for which the request is made. The applicant shall provide a plat that shows the road or easement for which the application is being filed. The plat shall be prepared by a land surveyor registered by the State of Georgia.
(b)
Review. The county clerk will coordinate the review of the request with the county manager, county attorney and the road department.
If the county manager determines that the application does not meet the criteria for abandonment because the road in question still has substantial useful purpose, the process will stop. The county manager will notify the applicant of the decision in writing within ten days. The applicant may appeal the county manager's decision to the board of commissioners by filing a written notice of such appeal with the county manager within ten days of the date of his decision. The board of commissioners may either uphold the manager's decision or direct him to proceed with a public hearing. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the decision by the county manager within ten days.
If the county manager finds that the application meets the criteria of these guidelines, an advertisement will be sent to the official organ of the county, once a week for two weeks, advising that a public hearing will be held to determine whether the proposed abandonment has "ceased to be used by the public or no longer serves any useful public purpose". The county clerk will notify, by return receipt requested mail, all effected property owners who own property adjacent to the proposed road to be abandoned, of the public hearing.
(c)
Determination by the county commission. If the board of commissioners approves the abandonment, the county attorney will prepare a deed and file it for recording with the clerk of superior court if the identity of the grantee for such a deed is clear. The submitted plat may require a revision if the board of commissioners places conditions on the approved abandonment. The applicant will bear the cost of any required plat modifications. Only after the deed recording by the county attorney is the action final. The original deed (if any) will be mailed to the applicant(s) by the county clerk.
No application for abandonment may be made, or considered, if any portion of the property sought to be abandoned has been the subject of an abandonment application filed, or considered by the Brantley County Board of Commissioners, within the immediate preceding two years.
(d)
Fee. Any request submitted under this provision shall be accompanied by a $350.00 cashier's check, a non-refundable application fee. The applicant may withdraw the application or request a postponement of the hearing date once, by submitting a written request, at least seven calendar days prior to the date set for the public hearing. If a postponement is requested, the applicant will bear the additional administrative charges (advertising and administrative costs).
