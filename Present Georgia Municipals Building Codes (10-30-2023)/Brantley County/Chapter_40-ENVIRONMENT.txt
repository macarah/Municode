Secs. 40-1—40-30. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - WETLANDS, GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS AND RIVER CORRIDORS PROTECTION
DIVISION 1. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS

Sec. 40-31. - Purpose.
(a)
In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Brantley County and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that Brantley County and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water.
(b)
Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.

DIVISION 2. - WETLANDS

Sec. 40-51. - Purpose.
(a)
The wetlands in Brantley County are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control, flood control, erosion control, natural resource education, scientific study, and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the State of Georgia.
(b)
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
(c)
The purpose of this division is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.
(Res. of 11-15-2001, § I)
Sec. 40-52. - Definitions.
[The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:]
Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps for Brantley County, Georgia.
Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. section 1344, as amended.
Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.
(Res. of 11-15-2001, § II)
Sec. 40-53. - Establishment of the wetlands protection district.
(a)
The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Brantley County, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this division, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
(b)
The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this division does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Res. of 11-15-2001, § III)
Sec. 40-54. - Protection criteria.
Requirement for local permit or permission. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the county. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by an authorized official of the county using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
(Res. of 11-15-2001, § IV)
Sec. 40-55. - Permitted uses.

DIVISION 3. - RIVER CORRIDORS

Sec. 40-71. - Purpose.
(a)
River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in Georgia. These corridors are of vital importance to Georgia in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters.
(b)
The Satilla River has been designated as a protected river by the State of Georgia. The purpose of this division is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Satilla River as defined herein.
(Res. of 11-15-2001, § I)
Sec. 40-72. - Definitions.
[The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:]
Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 C.F.R. section 261.3. (Note: This is same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.)
Land disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land, clearing of vegetation, and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land-disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use.
Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area means a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "The Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species.
Perennial river means a river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year.
Port facility means any facility for the docking, loading, and unloading of ships.
Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. However, those segments of river covered by the Metropolitan River Protection Act or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act are specifically excluded from the definition of a protected river. In coastal areas, the seaward limit of any protected river shall be the inland limits of the jurisdiction of the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act.
Public utility or utilities means a service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity that provides such service or services and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services.
River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow.
River corridor means all the land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440—12-5-457), or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280—12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks.
The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river banks, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection district.
Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the Brantley County Comprehensive Plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next comprehensive plan review by the department of community affairs.
Sensitive natural area means any area, as identified now or hereafter by the department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following:
(1)
Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species;
(2)
Rare or exemplary natural communities;
(3)
Significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or
(4)
Other areas so designated by the department of natural resources; and which are sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration.
Single-family dwelling means a dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family.

Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Sept. 14, 2010, §§ 1.1—1.7, 2.0, 3.1—3.7, 4.1—4.3, 5.1, and 5.2, did not specify manner of inclusion; hence, codification as Art. III, §§ 40-101—40-108, 40-121—40-127, 40-141—40-143, 40-161, and 40-162 was at the discretion of the editor.

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 40-101. - Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
The land development process generally alters the hydrologic response of development sites. If not properly designed land development can result in increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, can alter salinity concentrations and potentially increases flooding, channel erosion and pollutant transport and deposition in wetlands, rivers, estuaries and streams;
(2)
The land development process may increase bacteria transport and deposition in near coastal waters, which leads to beach contamination and poses a serious threat to human health;
(3)
The land development process may decrease the amount of rainfall that is available to recharge shallow groundwater aquifers;
(4)
The negative impacts of the land development process can be controlled and minimized through the management of stormwater runoff rates and pollutant loads;
(5)
Therefore, Brantley County has determined that it is in the public interest to control and minimize the adverse impacts of the land development process and has established this set of local stormwater management regulations to control post-construction stormwater runoff rate on development and redevelopment sites.
(Ord. of 9-14-2010, § 1.1)
Sec. 40-102. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect and maintain the integrity of local aquatic resources and, consequently, the health, safety and welfare of the general public, by establishing local stormwater management regulations that control and minimize the adverse impacts of the land development process. The ordinance seeks to achieve these goals by:
(1)
Establishing decision-making processes that can be applied during the site planning and design process to help protect the integrity of local aquatic resources;
(2)
Establishing site planning and design criteria to help protect natural resources from the direct impacts of the land development process;
(3)
Establishing post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria to help reduce flooding, channel erosion and pollutant transport and deposition in local aquatic resources;
(4)
Establishing design guidelines for green infrastructure and stormwater management practices that can be used to meet the post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria;
(5)
Offer as an option and encourage use of green infrastructure practices, which include better site planning techniques and low impact development practices. All green infrastructure practices must be sized using the design guidelines provided in the Coastal Stormwater Supplement (CSS) to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM);
(6)
Establishing administrative procedures for the submittal, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved development projects.

In addition, appropriate stormwater management practices shall be installed, where necessary, to protect properties and drainage channels that are located between the development site and the location of the off-site or regional stormwater management practice.
To be eligible for compliance through the use of off-site stormwater management practices, the applicant must submit a stormwater management design plan to Brantley County that shows the adequacy of the off-site or regional stormwater management practice and demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the county engineer, that the off-site or regional stormwater management practice will not result in the following impacts:
(1)
Increased threat of flood damage or endangerment to public health or safety;
(2)
Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams and other structures;
(3)
Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation.
