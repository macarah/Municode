ARTICLE IX(B). - C-3, WAREHOUSES AND DISTRIBUTION

Section 901(B). - Purpose and intent.
The C-3 Commercial District is established with the purpose of reserving certain areas with relatively level topography, adequate water and sewage facilities, and access to arterial streets for warehouse/distribution operations. Warehouse/distribution operations with the emission of noise, vibration, smoke, dust, gas, fumes, odors, or other nuisances, or radiation or other environmental hazards, and that create fire or explosion hazards or other objectionable conditions are prohibited. Uses within this district should not require substantial quantities of water for warehouse/distribution operations and should not necessarily require rail, air and water transportation. No uses which pose risks of ground or surface water contamination, air pollution or other environmental hazards shall be permitted. For property to be rezoned to C-3, Commercial District it has to have a minimum of 40 acres, the building/structure cannot exceed a total of 10,000 square feet per acre; building/structure setback minimums are 75 feet from the right of way of a street/roadway and to the rear and side property lines and 30% of the property must remain greenspace.
