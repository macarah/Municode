Sec. 10-31. - Findings.
(a)
Sexually oriented businesses require special supervision in order to protect and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the citizens of the communities where they locate.
(b)
Permitting and/or licensing is a legitimate means of accountability to ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
(c)
There is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values.
(d)
It is recognized that sexually oriented businesses, due to their nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when they are located in proximity to each other, thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area.
(e)
It is the intent of this article not to suppress any speech activities or entertainment protected by the First Amendment, but to enact a content neutral ordinance that addresses the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses as well as the health problems associated with such businesses.
(f)
Pursuant to Ga. Const. art. III, § VI, ¶ VII and to protect the public safety, health and welfare as follows the board of commissioners adopt the following adult entertainment regulations.
(Ord. No. 98-11, 7-14-1998)
Sec. 10-32. - Purpose.
Based upon the experience of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Marietta, Georgia, which experiences are relevant to the problems and circumstances faced by the county, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity, either partial or total, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in adult entertainment establishments begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditures for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of criminal behavior and acceleration of community blight in particular areas. The intent of the board of commissioners in adopting this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse effect on property values, on the public health, safety, and welfare of the county, on its citizens and property, and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression. Instead, this article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and their patrons. This article is not intended to allow or license any business, establishment, or activity which would otherwise be unlawful.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2003-06, § 1, adopted March 11, 2003, repealed § 10-47 in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, § 10-47 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 98-11, § 5.04.610, adopted July 14, 1998.
Sec. 10-48. - Restrictions on transferability and addition of additional partners or shareholders.
(a)
No license issued under this article shall be sold, given, transferred, or assigned by any licensee, or by operation of law, to any other person, persons, or entities. Any such sale, gift, transfer, or assignment, or attempted sale, gift, transfer, or assignment shall be deemed to constitute a voluntary surrender of the license and such license shall thereafter be null and void. Provided, however, if the licensee is a partnership or corporation, and one or more of the partners or shareholders, as the case may be, should die, one or more of the surviving partners or shareholders who were partners or shareholders at the time of issuance of the license, and who wish to carry on the business by their service in a managing capacity, may acquire, by purchase or otherwise, the interest of the deceased partner or shareholder without effecting a surrender or termination of such license, and in such case, the new licensee shall immediately notify the business license department of the county. An adult entertainment establishment license issued to a corporation shall be deemed terminated and void when either any outstanding stock of the corporation is sold, transferred, or assigned after the issuance of such a license, or any stock authorized but not issued at the time of the granting of a license under this article is thereafter issued and sold, transferred, or assigned.
(b)
No licensee shall change the name or location of the establishment without obtaining a new license.

Where the violation is for a misdemeanor, forfeiture of bond, violation of a county or municipal ordinance, or where there is a plea of nolo contendere, the business license department or the board of commissioners if an appeal is filed, after hearing, may after investigation of the charges involved, waive the violation as a disqualification.
(Ord. No. 98-11, § 5.04.630, 7-14-1998)

(3)
Where there is evidence that there are no licenses granted in the area or where there is evidence that the proposed area is already adequately supplied with such licenses.
(4)
Where there is evidence that a license for the location would be detrimental to the property values in the area.
(5)
Where there is evidence that the license in that location would be detrimental to traffic conditions or that there is a lack of sufficient parking spaces for automobiles.

(8)
In addition to the provisions of this section and in determining whether or not any license applied for shall be granted, the following shall be considered in the public interest and welfare:
a.

(3)
That applicant has withdrawn, without permission of the board or the department, an application at any time within seven days immediately preceding the time and date set for the hearing before the board or department unless at least one year shall have expired from such withdrawal.
