TITLE V. - CAD, CONSOLIDATED AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT-INTENSIVE[2]

Footnotes:
--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2005-02, § 2, adopted Jan. 11, 2005, renamed title V to read as herein set out. Formerly, said title pertained to the CAD, Commercial Agricultural District.

Section 501. - Purpose and intent.
A.
The CAD, Consolidated Agricultural District-Intensive is established to provide areas for the maintenance and expansion of agricultural production on large areas (minimum of 20 acres) in the area of food crops, fiber crops, animal feed, poultry, livestock and timber production.
B.
Agricultural districts are most appropriately located in areas where intensive agricultural operations already exist and in those areas removed from residential or other development such that nuisances affecting other properties are minimized.
C.
In order for a parcel or tract of land to be considered for rezoning to CAD, the parcel or tract of land must consist of at least 20 acres of contiguous property (property divided by a public road shall be contiguous property.)
D.
Reserved.
E.
Land zoned CAD should be in use for good faith farming or agricultural uses worthy of protection and preservation. If, after a tract or parcel of land is zoned or rezoned to CAD, the land is not actively used for intensive commercial agricultural purposes or if the tract or parcel of land consists of less than 20 acres, the county may, at its discretion, initiate procedures for a zoning review and possible rezoning of the property.
F.
The siting of private landfills in this district is inconsistent with the intent of this district.

a)
Septage shall be injected below the surface of the land and no significant amount of septage shall be present on the land surface within one hour after the septage is injected. Injection may be accomplished by any device(s) that places the septage beneath the soil surface in a narrow trench at a depth of no greater than 18 inches and promptly replaces the cover soil in the same action of trenching and placing septage. Excavation of a trench followed by placement of septage and later covering of the trench is not considered injection.
b)
Septage applied to the surface of the land shall be incorporated into the soil within six hours after septage application or
c)
The pH of domestic septage shall be raised to 12 or higher by alkali addition and, without the addition of more alkali, shall remain at 12 or higher for 30 minutes. Septage is to be applied in a manner which will prevent any ponding standing of liquid on the land surface twenty four hours after application.
Note: Each container of domestic septage must be monitored for compliance with 503.33(b)(12).
G.
Application rate. The annual application rate for septage applied to a land application site shall not exceed 40,000 gallons per acre per year. The septage must be spread or injected as evenly as possible over the entire acreage where the crop or vegetation is grown. This rate is calculated assuming a value of 100 pounds per acre per year of nitrogen required by the crop or vegetation grown on the land. The formula is found as equation 1, in 40 CFR Part 503.13(c)
H.
Record keeping. Individuals involved in land application of domestic septage shall maintain the following information for five years and that information shall be available for inspection by the Banks County Planning Department.
a)
The location, by either street address or latitude and longitude, of each site on which domestic septage is applied.
b)
The number of acres of each site on which domestic septage is applied.
c)
The date, time, and quantity of domestic septage applied to each site.
d)
The crop or vegetation grown on each site.
e)
The rate in gallons per acre per year at which septage is applied to each site.
f)
The following certification statement: "I certify, under penalty of law, that the pathogen requirements in section 503.32(c)(1) and the vector attraction requirements in section 503.33(b)(9) or (b)(10) have been met. This determination has been made under my direction and supervision in accordance with the system designed to ensure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information used to determine that the pathogen requirements and vector attraction reduction requirements have been met. I am aware that there are significant penalties for false certification including the possibility of fine or imprisonment".
g)
A description of how management requirements for pathogens and vector attraction reduction requirements as required by this Ordinance are met.
h)
The name of the company and signature of the person who applied the septage.
I.
Compliance. Compliance with management practices, vector attraction practices and application rates may be determined by review of records required by this Ordinance.
J.
Septage holding facilities. It is necessary that all septage land disposal systems have an alternative method for the temporary holding of septage during periods of adverse weather, and such systems shall meet the following requirements: a) No overflow or leakage of septage may be allowed from the system onto the ground surface, into surface waters or the groundwater table; b) Odors from such systems are to be controlled at all times; c) Septage is to be removed from the holding facility to the land disposal system as soon as weather and soil conditions permit.
K.
Surface (land) application. Surface application is a frequently used septage disposal method, but as with any surface application technique, some nitrogen (N) loss occurs through ammonia volatilization. Consideration should be given to intermediate holding facilities before application to the land. Storage is necessary just prior to or during, periods of precipitation in order to prevent run off of contaminated water. In winter months, land application should be limited to non-frozen surfaces to prevent run off during thaws. Intermediate holding facilities are required for those seasonal periods when ground surfaces are frozen. Pathogen die-off during storage is also a factor in favor of using storage facilities. Pre-treatment may be required to avoid odors and to meet vector attraction reduction requirements.
L.
Subsurface application. Subsurface application techniques include plow furrow cover (PFC), subsurface injection (SSI), and terreater injection, which is a patented device for subsurface injection. Placement in trenches and lagoons are considered burial practices and are not approved. Soil incorporation techniques offer better odor and vector control than surface spreading techniques. A storage facility approved by the Banks County Planning Department is required. A resting period of one to two weeks is required before equipment can be driven over waste incorporated land.
13.
Commercial kennels, if such structures shall be located closer than 400 feet from any adjacent property line and/or closer than 800 feet from any residence on adjacent property.
14.
Campgrounds for not more than ten spaces for vehicles (recreational vehicles and campers). If approved as a conditional use, campgrounds with not more than ten spaces shall not have to comply with Chapters 50 and 51 of the Code of Banks County.
15.
Animal Waste Lagoons.
