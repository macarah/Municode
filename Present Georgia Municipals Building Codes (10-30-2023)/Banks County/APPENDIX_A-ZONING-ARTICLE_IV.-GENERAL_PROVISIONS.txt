Section 416. - Variances.
The governing body is hereby empowered to authorize upon application in specific cases such variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The existence of a nonconforming use or conditional use of neighboring land, buildings or structures in the same zoning district or of permitted uses, conditional uses or nonconforming uses in other zoning districts shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance. A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship, after appropriate application and public hearings in accordance with the policies and procedures ordinance, upon specific findings that all of the following conditions exist, with the absence of any one of the conditions being grounds for denial of the application for variance:
1.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same district; and
2.
A literal interpretation of the provisions of these regulations would create an unnecessary hardship and would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners within the district in which the property is located; and
3.
Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located; and
4.
Relief, if granted, will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or the health or general welfare of the public in such a manner as will interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of other property or unreasonably affect its value; and
5.
The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant; and
6.
The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building, or structure; and
7.
The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, building or structures which are not permitted by right in the district involved.
Section 417. - Home occupations.
A home occupation as defined by these regulations shall conform to the following requirements:
1.
A maximum of one person not residing in the dwelling may be employed in connection with the home occupation. There is no limit on the number of other employees, provided that they reside within the dwelling on the premises.
2.
The home occupation shall be clearly incidental and secondary to the residential use of the dwelling and lot and shall not change the residential character of the building, lot, or neighborhood.
3.
No storage or display of products, equipment, customer vehicles or other items or other materials shall be visible from the adjoining street or adjacent properties.
4.
Vehicles used primarily as passenger vehicles shall be permitted in connection with the conduct of a home occupation, but only one commercial vehicle is permitted to be used per home occupation.
5.
No external alterations of the dwelling solely for the accommodation of a home occupation are permitted. No home occupation shall be conducted in a separate garage, barn, shop or other accessory building unless the home occupation is approved as a conditional use by the county commissioners.
6.
No chemical, electrical, or mechanical equipment shall be used in connection with the home occupation if it generates any noise, odor, environmental hazard or other nuisance which is detectible to any extent at the common boundary of the property and any neighboring properties. No such equipment shall be placed so as to be visible to any neighboring property or any public road.
7.
No business identification sign for a home occupation business shall be allowed in a R-1 or R-2 zoning district but in all other districts one non-illuminated business identification sign not exceeding 12 square feet shall be permitted.
8.
Use of a dwelling for a home occupation shall not exceed 25 percent of one floor of the principal dwelling. In addition to the other requirements of this section, home occupations shall be permitted, in whole or part, within accessory buildings only on lots of at least two acres and if a setback of 50 feet is maintained from each property line.
9.
A business license shall be obtained from Banks County prior to the operation of any home occupation. Said business license shall require approval by the zoning administrative officer.
10.
The following uses are allowable as home occupations (not all inclusive): tutoring, consultation and instruction in music, dance, arts, crafts and similar subjects limited to two students at one time; day care centers serving six or less persons; professional services (i.e., attorneys, architects, accountants, realtors, insurance and travel agents); secretarial services and answering services; mail order and general offices not involving storage of equipment, materials, products or vehicles; phone solicitations, beauty salons and barber shops limited to two operators/chairs; food catering).
11.
The following are conditional uses: cabinet shops and/or metal cutting; doctors, dentists or other medical professions; automobile body work; automobile repair or related work, and any other home occupation where an accessory building is to be built on or moved to the property for such use.
The failure of a home occupation licensee to comply with any of the above conditions shall be reasonable grounds for revocation of a home occupation business license.
All applicants for home occupations must appear before the Board of Commissioners of Banks County and only the Board of Commissioners of Banks County can approve a home occupation.

Except as otherwise expressly permitted, it shall be prohibited in all districts to park or continuously store abandoned, wrecked, junked or inoperable vehicles, power-driven construction equipment, used lumber or metal, or any other miscellaneous scrap material in quantity that is visible from a public street or adjacent or surrounding property. Said prohibition shall not be construed so as to prohibit the temporary repair or maintenance of automobiles owned by the property owner or the storage of such vehicles, equipment or other materials within an enclosed building, provided that such vehicles, equipment or materials are not for commercial sale. This section shall be construed to permit such vehicles or equipment, unless such use can be construed to be a junk/salvage yard or wrecked motor vehicle compound, if such vehicles and/or materials are not visible from a public street or surrounding property; that is, if screening is provided as defined by this Resolution. Existing junk/salvage yards and wrecked motor vehicle compounds qualifying as nonconforming uses shall have until July 1, 1992, to comply with the screening provisions of this section.
Section 420. - Noise control regulations.
The ambient noise level of any given activity in any zoning district emanating from a given property shall not exceed the following maximum permitted decibels as measured from the closest property line of property located within an ARR or R-1 zoning district:

601—1200 45
1201—2400 45
2401—4800 40
Above 4800 40
  Note: The measurement of sound or noise shall be made with a sound level meter and octave band analyzer meeting the standards prescribed by the American Standards Association which is maintained in calibration and good working order.
Existing facilities and activities which exceed the permitted maximum sound pressure specified above shall, no later than July 1, 1992, institute or install suitable noise attenuation measures (reduction of activity, erection of barriers, etc.) so that noise levels no longer exceed the maximums herein established.
In cases where noise studies have been prepared by or for the governing body which document that a given facility or activity exceeds the maximum permitted sound pressure specified in this section on two or more separate days of measurement, and the period of conformity described above has elapsed, the governing body may institute whatever legal proceedings and remedies as may be provided by law to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section.
