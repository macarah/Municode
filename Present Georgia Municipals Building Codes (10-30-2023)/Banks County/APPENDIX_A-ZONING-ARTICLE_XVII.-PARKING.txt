(a)
Fractions. Where a fractional space results during the calculation of required parking, the required number of parking spaces shall be construed to be the next highest whole number.
(b)
Parking space requirement not specified. Where the parking requirement for a particular use is not described in this article, and where no similar use is listed, the Banks County Building Inspector shall determine the number of spaces to be provided based on requirements for similar uses, location of the proposed use, the number of employees on the largest shift, and the expected demand and traffic generated by the proposed use.
(c)
Required parking for multiple uses. When a building includes a combination of uses, the required number of parking spaces shall be the sum of the required parking for each use when the multiple uses operate simultaneously. For non-simultaneous use, the parking requirements for the use requiring the greater number of parking spaces will govern.

Sec. 1713. - Reduction of required parking for off-site arrangements.
Off-site parking may be used in combination to meet minimum parking space requirements. A reduction of required off-street parking spaces on a given site may be permitted by the Banks County Building Inspector in cases where additional off-street, off-site, parking area of sufficient quantity and in conformity with this article compensates for the reduction, subject to the following:
(1)
The property is under one ownership, or a valid agreement exists between the two property owners for use of the parking area.
(2)
Off-site parking shall be located within 500 feet of the building or buildings in which it is leased to serve.

(Ord. No. 2005-13, § 1(Exh. A), 5-10-2005)
Sec. 1715. - Reduction of required parking for alternative transportation arrangements.
The Banks County Building Inspector may in individual cases administratively authorize a reduction in the minimum number of parking spaces for projects that are directly served by public transit and for projects that provide bicycle parking, provided that it can be shown that such available alternative travel modes will reduce the overall need for parking on the site proportional to the requested reduction in parking spaces.

(1)
The Banks County Building Inspector may allow parking at a rate in excess of 25 percent above the required number of spaces, on a case-by-case basis based upon the scale and impacts of the request for good cause shown. The applicant shall make said request in writing, which shall include documentation from an acceptable industry publication (e.g., Institute of Transportation Engineers, Urban Land Institute, American Planning Association, etc.) or by a study prepared by a traffic engineering firm that documents parking requirements.
(2)
The Banks County Building Inspector may allow a land area for parking that exceeds 25 percent above the required number of spaces to be designed and reserved for future parking use. In such a case, said reserved parking area shall not be developed except by written permission from the Banks County Building Inspector, upon demonstration by the applicant that existing parking spaces are occupied at a rate of 90 percent or higher for 25 percent or more of the regular business hours in which the business or use operates during a non-holiday week.
