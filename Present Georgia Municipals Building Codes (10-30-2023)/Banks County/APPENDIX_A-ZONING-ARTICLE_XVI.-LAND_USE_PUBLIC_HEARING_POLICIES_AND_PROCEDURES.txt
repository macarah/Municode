(Res. No. 2003-02, § 2, 2-11-2003)
Section 1620. - Criteria to consider for variances.
The applicant, zoning administrative officer and planning commission should review applications for variances with regard to the following criteria: The grant of such variance from the terms of the county zoning regulations will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of such regulations will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The existence of a nonconforming use or conditional use of neighboring land, buildings or structures in the same zoning district or of permitted uses, conditional uses or nonconforming uses in other zoning districts shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance. A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship, after appropriate application and public hearings as set forth in this article, upon specific findings that all of the following conditions exist, with the absence of any one of the conditions being grounds for denial of the application for variance:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same district;
(2)
A literal interpretation of the provisions of these regulations would create an unnecessary hardship and would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners within the district in which the property is located;
(3)
Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located;
(4)
Relief, if granted, will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or the health or general welfare of the public in such a manner as will interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of other property or unreasonably affect its value;
(5)
The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant;
(6)
The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building, or structure; and
(7)
The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, building or structures which are not permitted by right in the district involved.
(Res. No. 2003-02, § 2, 2-11-2003)
Section 1621. - Action by the board of commissioners.
After the procedures called for under the this article have been completed, the board of commissioners may take action to approve or deny the request or take any other action permitted by this article or consented to by the applicant.
(Res. No. 2003-02, § 2, 2-11-2003)
Section 1622. - Conditional approval permitted.
The zoning administrative officer and planning commission may recommend, and the board of commissioners may approve, applications for zoning map amendments, conditional use permits, variances and other applications under these regulations subject to certain conditions, provided that the conditions are set forth in the ordinance relating to the approval of the application. The conditions of approval may reduce the number or type of allowed uses, limit the nature or scope of allowed uses, restrict certain activities on the property, restrict the number and kind of improvements which may be made on the property, stipulate specific acts which the property owner will perform, or mandate any other conditions related to the physical use of land and which are designed to render the proposed zoning or use appropriate when considered in light of the criteria set out in this article.
(Res. No. 2003-02, § 2, 2-11-2003)
Section 1623. - Criteria to consider special use permit.
A.
The special use permit is designed to be used when:
1.
A unique use not addressed in any zoning district is desired for development and is not likely to be duplicated within Banks County; or
2.
A nonconforming use exists in a zoning district under the Zoning Resolution of Banks County that has been in existence for a number of years and needs to expand at its present location; and,
3.
The special use would be consistent with the needs of the neighborhood or the community as a whole, be compatible with the neighborhood and would not be in conflict with the overall objective of the Banks County Comprehensive Plan (Paragraph 3 applies to [subsections] 1 and 2 above).
B.
In order to accommodate these special uses, the special use permit allows the board of commissioners to approve a special use on a particular parcel without changing the general zoning district. Such approval shall be subject to the requirements set forth above and any additional conditions deemed necessary to ensure the compatibility of the special use with the surrounding properties.
C.
All special use permit applications shall be for firm development proposals only. The special use permit shall not be used for securing early zoning for conceptual proposals which may not be undertaken for some time.
D.
A special use permit application shall be considered only if it is made by the owner of the property or his/her designated agent.
E.
An application for a special use permit shall follow the same procedures as set forth in the Banks County Zoning Ordinance for an application for rezoning (i.e., application filed with Banks County Planning Department, public hearing after advertisement before the Banks County Planning Commission, recommendation by the Banks County Planning Commission to the Banks County Board of Commissioners, public hearing after advertisement before the Board of Commissioners of Banks County and approval or denial by the Board of Commissioners of Banks County). The special use for which a special use permit is granted shall commence operations or construction within 12 months of the date of approval by the board of commissioners. If the use for which the special use permit was issued is discontinued for nine continuous months, the special use permit shall terminate.
F.
The minimum requirements for a special use permit are:
1.
In addition to the information and/or site plans which are required to be submitted for the proposed development, additional information deemed necessary by the Banks County Planning Department in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area shall be submitted.
2.
If an application is approved and a special use permit is granted, all conditions which may have been attached to the approval are binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property shall be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions.
3.
Changes to a special use, or development of a site for the special use, shall be treated as an amendment to the special use permit and shall be subject to the same application and review process as a new application.
4.
Upon approval by the board of commissioners, a special use permit shall be identified on the Official Zoning Map of Banks County.
5.
Upon approval by the board of commissioners of a special use permit, the owner of the property shall be issued a notice from the Banks County Planning Department which states the specific use permitted, the requirements of this section and any conditions attached to the approval.
6.
The Banks County Planning Department shall not issue a certificate of occupancy for the specific use unless all requirements and conditions of the special use permit have been fulfilled by the owner of the property.
G.
The applicant, zoning administrative officer, planning commission and governing authority will review applications for special uses with regard to the following criteria:
1.
Whether off-street parking and loading facilities are adequate in terms of location, amount and design to serve the proposed use.
2.
Whether the number, size and type of signs proposed are compatible with the surrounding area.
3.
Whether the proposed use will have compatibility with existing uses of adjacent land and the surrounding area and will not cause or create or be likely to cause or create, adverse effects upon the existing or future development of either the area or the rest of the county.
4.
Whether ingress and egress to the property is suitable and safe and the effect of the proposed activity on traffic flow along adjoining streets is not adverse.
5.
Whether the location and intensity of outdoor lighting is such that it does not case light on adjacent, adjoining or neighboring properties.
6.
Whether hours and manner of operation of the proposed use are inconsistent with adjacent and nearby uses.
7.
Whether existing public facilities and utilities are capable of adequately serving the proposed use.
8.
Whether the proposed use will have a significant adverse effect on the level of property values or the general character of land uses in the surrounding area or the county.
9.
Whether the physical conditions of the site, including size, shape, topography and drainage, are suitable for the proposed development.
10.
The existing uses and zoning of nearby property and whether the proposed use will adversely affect the existing use or usability of nearby property.
11.
The extent to which property values of the applicant are diminished by the inability to take advantage of the potential use.
12.
The extent to which the destruction of property values of the applicant promotes the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public.
13.
The relative gain to the public, as compared, to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner.
14.
The physical suitability of the subject property for development for other possible uses in the zoning district.
15.
The length of time the property has been vacant, considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property, and whether there are existing or changed conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the conditional use.
16.
The extent to which the proposed use will or could cause excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, schools, parks, or other public facilities.
17.
Whether the proposed use will create risks of adverse environmental effects to the community including, without limitation, air pollution, surface water contamination or ground water contamination.
18.
Whether the proposed use has nuisance characteristics.
