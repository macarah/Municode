ARTICLE V. - WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES

Sec. 98-136. - Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the term:
Above ground level or AGL means a measurement of height from the natural grade of a site to the highest point of a structure.
Accessory equipment means any equipment serving or being used in conjunction with a wireless telecommunication facility or wireless support structure.
Antenna means communications equipment that transmits, receives, or transmits and receives electromagnetic radio signals used in the provision of all types of wireless communication services.
Attached wireless telecommunications facility means an antenna or antenna array that is secured to an existing building or structure (except an antenna support structure) with any accompanying pole or device which attaches it to the building or structure, together with transmission cables, and an equipment cabinet, which may be located either on the roof or inside/outside of the building or structure. An attached wireless telecommunications facility is considered to be an accessory use to the existing principal use on a site.
City means the City of Jesup, Georgia.
Collocate or collocation means the placement or installation of new wireless facilities on previously approved and constructed wireless support structures, including monopoles and towers, both self-supporting and guyed, in a manner that negates the need to construct a new freestanding wireless support structure. Such term includes the placement of accessory equipment within an existing equipment compound.
Concealed wireless telecommunications facility means a wireless telecommunications facility that is disguised, hidden, part of an existing or proposed structure or placed within an existing or proposed structure, to include antennas, ancillary structures, and utilities.
Distributed antennae system or DAS means a network of smaller, spatially separated antenna nodes installed on either existing or new structures and connected to a communications network. A DAS network splits the transmitted signal among several smaller antennas to provide coverage and reliability over the same area as a single cell support structure antenna. DAS is a form of combined antennas.
Equipment compound means an area surrounding or adjacent to the base of a wireless support structure within which accessory equipment is located.
Federal aviation administration or FAA means the government agency responsible for regulating civil aviation.
Federal Communications Commission or FCC means the government agency responsible for regulating telecommunications.
Small cell installations means one-carrier units that provide additional capacity for wireless systems and are supplemental to standard wireless telecommunications facility installations.
Wireless support structure means a freestanding structure designed to support or capable of supporting wireless facilities.
Wireless telecommunication facility or WTF means the set of equipment and network components, exclusive of the underlying support structure, including antennas, transmitters, receivers, base stations, power supplies, cabling, and accessory equipment, used to provide wireless data and wireless telecommunication services.
