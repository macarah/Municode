(13)
A landscaped buffer strip shall be located adjacent to each exterior property line of the mobile home subdivision. The width of such required buffer strip shall vary according to the screening contained within the buffer strip. If landscaped plantings only are used, the buffer strip shall be at least 50 feet wide and contain visually solid landscaped screening at least six feet high, approved by the city. If visually solid earth mounds or berms are used, then they shall be at least six feet in height and landscaped, and the required width of the buffer strip shall be reduced to a minimum of 25 feet. Such buffer strip shall be dedicated as a permanent easement and deed restriction, but shall remain in the ownership of the adjacent property owners for their limited use, enjoyment and maintenance, with further provision that no permanent structures of any type may ever be erected within the buffer strip. The portions of a lot within a buffer strip shall not be utilized when determining whether total lot size meets minimum requirements of this article. The remainder of a lot, excluding the buffer strip, shall at least meet the minimum lot size requirements under this article, but in no instance shall it be less than the equivalent square footage of the average of adjacent subdivision lots without the buffer strip.
(14)
Entrances to mobile home subdivisions shall be landscaped and signed in a harmonious and visually attractive manner.
(15)
No provisions of this article shall be construed to relieve the developer of meeting additional provisions or requirements required of all subdivisions under the subdivision regulations (appendix B to this Code) of the city.
(16)
No part of any mobile home subdivision shall be used for nonresidential purposes, except such uses that are approved by the planning commission and board of commissioners, as necessary, for the management and maintenance of the subdivision or the well being of the mobile home park residents.

Mobile homes may not be used on individually owned lots for residential purposes, other than on lots within an approved mobile home subdivision.
(2)
No temporary permits for mobile homes in residential zones shall be allowed, except in the case of a natural disaster or other act of God where a single-family residence was destroyed for a period not to exceed 90 days. Such temporary permit shall expire and may not be renewed unless a building permit for reconstruction of the single-family residence is issued within the 90-day period. Upon issuance of a building permit, the temporary permit may be extended for the length of construction or a period not to exceed six months, whichever is less.
(3)
A mobile home may be used for office or security space, on a temporary basis, for the length of construction only, upon city permit, in nonresidential zones, upon a lot for which a building permit for permanent construction has been issued.
