This article shall be referred to and cited as the "City of Trenton Adult Entertainment Ordinance".
(Ord. of 1-3-2000, §§ 1.01, 1.02)
Sec. 10-62. - Applicability.
The provisions of this article shall apply to all the incorporated areas of city and no business or establishment shall be undertaken, commenced or maintained without prior approval and authorization pursuant to the provisions herein.
(Ord. of 1-3-2000, § 1.03)
Sec. 10-63. - Purpose.
This article is designed for various purposes including:
(1)
To establish rules, regulations, procedures and standards for the licensing of adult entertainment establishments as defined herein.
(2)
To foster and preserve the public health, safety, comfort and welfare, and to aid in the harmonious, orderly, aesthetically pleasing and socially beneficial development of the county.
(3)
To regulate certain types of businesses, including but not limited to adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse affect on property values and on the public health, safety, and welfare of the city, and on its citizens and property, and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression. This article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. This article is not intended to allow or license any business, establishment, or activity, which would otherwise be unlawful.

Sec. 10-64. - Findings.
The board of commissioners finds that many types of criminal activity may be engendered by the types of activities, which are regulated herein. These criminal activities are a drain on law enforcement resources. A consequential result of such criminal activity is the decline of our neighborhoods and a decline in property values. In looking to neighboring jurisdiction, we recognize the detrimental and deleterious effects brought about by these activities. The board finds it to be in the public interest to vigorously, within the bounds of the law, regulate and control adult entertainment establishments to avoid, to the extent possible, the undesirable consequences of such activities.
