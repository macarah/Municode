Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Dec. 3, 2009, amended Ch. 30, Art. II, to read as set out herein. Former Art. II pertained similar subject matter and derived from an ordinance adopted Sept. 1, 1981; and an ordinance adopted Dec. 6, 1988, § 1.
State Law reference— Limits on sound volume produced by radio, tape player, or other mechanical sound-making device or instrument from within the motor vehicle, O.C.G.A. § 40-6-14; sale of muffler which causes excessive noise prohibited, O.C.G.A. § 40-8-71(c).

Sec. 30-35. - Definitions.
dBA: The A-weighted unit of sound pressure level.
Decibel: The unit of measurement for sound pressure level at a specified location.
Emergency vehicles: Vehicles of the fire, police, and public service departments and legally authorized ambulances and emergency vehicles of states departments and any political subdivision thereof, and vehicles of public service corporations.
Emergency work: Work required to restore property or infrastructure to a safe condition following a natural or human caused disaster, work required to protect persons or property from an imminent exposure to danger, or work by public or private utilities for providing or restoring immediately necessary utility services.
Motor vehicle: Any vehicle which is self-propelled and is used primarily for transporting people or property.
Muffler: Part of the exhaust system of a motor vehicle that is intended to reduce noise.
Noise sensitive areas: Schools, courts, churches, hospitals, libraries, and streets and property adjacent to such institutions, provided that conspicuous signs are displayed about such institutions indicating the presence of such institutions.
Noise: Sound emitted from any and all sources and typically characterized by intensity, duration of any kind.
