ARTICLE VI. - WETLANDS

Sec. 30-240. - Title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Wetlands Protection Ordinance."
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-241. - Purpose and intent.
Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the well being of communities in the State of Georgia. Nationally, a considerable number of wetlands have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other activities. Without additional regulation, piecemeal or cumulative losses of wetlands will continue to occur over time. Therefore, it is in the interest of public safety and general welfare to avoid damage or destruction to wetlands. The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection by adopting a generalized wetlands map; provide for the withholding of land use and building permits in areas designated as wetlands until a jurisdictional wetland determination is completed; and establish permitted and prohibited land uses within wetlands shown on the generalized wetlands map.
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-242. - Definitions.
[The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article, unless otherwise specifically stated:]
Generalized wetlands map: A National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map showing wetlands within the local jurisdiction.
Jurisdictional wetland: An area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination: A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. ยง1344, as amended.
Regulated activity: Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas (see Figure). The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

Sec. 30-243. - Adoption of generalized wetlands map by reference.
The generalized wetlands map, as defined by this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference, and hereby made a part of this article as if fully set forth herein.
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-244. - Applicability.
This article shall apply to all lands within the unincorporated county that are shown on the generalized wetlands map, as defined by this article, as wetlands.
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-245. - Permit required.
No land use permit or building permit shall be issued by the county engineer or building official for a land use, building, structure, or manufactured home, nor shall any regulated activity as defined by this article commence, unless the land use, building, structure, manufactured home or regulated activity conforms to the requirements of this article. Prior to a land use permit or building permit being issued, the county engineer or building official shall require a site plan or subdivision plat in sufficient detail to review the proposed development for compliance with the provisions of this article.
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-246. - Jurisdictional wetland determination required.
(a)
If a major subdivision proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetland as shown on the generalized wetlands map, as determined by the land use officer, no local land use permit on said wetland shall be issued until a jurisdictional wetland determination has been completed and either of the following occurs:
(1)
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that there are jurisdictional wetlands present on the proposed development site, a Section 404 permit is required, and either a Section 404 permit or a letter of permission is issued by the Corps for the proposed development; or,
(2)
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that jurisdictional wetlands are not present on the proposed development site, and no Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required. Should it be determined that no jurisdictional wetlands are located within the major subdivision, the plat of the subdivision to be recorded by a licensed surveyor must textually indicate this prior to acceptance.
(b)
If an area within a minor subdivision or on a stand-alone property proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetland as shown on the generalized wetlands map, as determined by the land use officer, no local land use and/or building permit on said wetland shall be issued until either of the following occurs:
(1)
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that there are jurisdictional wetlands present on the proposed development site, a Section 404 permit is required, and either a Section 404 permit or a letter of permission is issued by the Corps for the proposed development; or
(2)
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that jurisdictional wetlands are not present on the proposed development site, and no Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required; or
(3)
Documentation from a competent environmental professional qualified to determine the location of wetlands is provided to the zoning administrator that said property does not contain a jurisdictional wetland, or that the subject development proposal will not disturb wetlands found to exist on the site. Said documentation shall specifically include the reference that the wetlands identification or finding that the site is outside of a jurisdictional wetland is based on a field study of the subject property and application of the federal manual for identifying and delineating wetlands.
(c)
Issuance of a county land use and/or building permit under this part will not guarantee the issuance of a permit, or of a permit with any specific provisions, by the Army Corps of Engineers; and the county and its commissioners and staff shall not be liable to the applicant, permit holder, successor in interest thereof, or any third party if the Army Corps of Engineers does not issue a permit or issues a permit under terms different from that issued by the county. The applicant, permit holder, successor in interest thereof, or any third party will be proceeding at his or her own risk in developing the property and any county government action under this section does not relieve them from federal or state permitting requirements.

Sec. 30-247. - Permitted uses.
The following uses shall be allowed as of right within an area shown as a wetland on the generalized wetlands map, to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein.
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(4)
The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
