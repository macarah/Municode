DIVISION 2. - PROCEDURE

Sec. 6-221. - Procedure for suspension and revocation.
(a)
An alcoholic beverage license may be suspended or revoked for cause upon written notice to the licensee by the zoning administrator. Cause for the suspension or revocation of such license shall consist of the violation of any laws or ordinances regulating such business or for the violation of any state or federal law; or for any change in the area where such business is located, which change is deemed by the board of commissioners to cause such business in such area to be undesirable; or any reason which would authorize the board of commissioners to refuse the issuance of a license; or any violation of this chapter. The sheriff's department shall notify the zoning administrator of a licensee or anyone in the employ of a licensee (i) being charged with or arrested for selling alcoholic beverages (A) to an underage person or persons or (B) on Sunday or (ii) being convicted of selling alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 3-3-22 during the current license year.
(b)
Once the zoning administrator becomes aware of facts that, if true, could support the revocation or suspension of a license, he shall place the matter for hearing by the county administrator. No alcoholic beverage license which has been issued or which may hereafter be issued shall be suspended or revoked except for cause as defined in this section, after a hearing and upon written notice to the holder of such license of the time, place and purpose of such hearing and a statement of the charge or charges upon which such hearing shall be held. Three days' notice shall be deemed reasonable, but shorter or longer periods of notice shall be authorized as the board of commissioners may deem the circumstances to justify.
(c)
The county administrator at such hearing shall hear evidence of the circumstances of the sale to the underage person or persons, of the unauthorized Sunday sale, or the sale to an intoxicated person, or such other violation of this chapter, and after said hearing may recommend that the license to sell alcoholic beverages be suspended for a period up to six months or less or the county administrator may recommend to the board of commissioners that the license be suspended for a period of greater than six months or revoked. In addition, the county administrator may order that a responsible alcohol sales and service workshop approved by the zoning administrator be attended by the licensee at the licensee's expense. The recommendation of the county administrator shall be in writing and shall be transmitted to the owner of the alcoholic beverage license and to the licensee by certified mail.
(d)
An order of the county administrator directing the licensee to attend a responsible alcohol sales and service workshop shall not be appealable. In the event the county administrator recommends that the alcoholic beverage license be suspended or revoked, the owner of the alcoholic beverage license, the licensee or both may appeal such recommendation to the board of commissioners. The appeal must be in writing and must be delivered to the county administrator within ten days of the date of receipt. If the owner of the alcoholic beverage license, the licensee or both should fail to appeal such recommendation then the owner of the alcoholic beverage license and the licensee shall be deemed to have acquiesced to such suspension or revocation and all rights to further appeals shall be deemed waived.
(e)
In the event that owner of an alcoholic beverage license, the licensee, or both appeal the recommendation of the county administrator, the board of commissioners shall, within 30 days of the date that the appeal is filed, review a summary of the hearing before the county administrator wherein the alcoholic beverage license was considered for suspension or revocation (the summary shall be prepared by the county administrator) and either place the matter down for a hearing or affirm or alter the decision of the county administrator without a hearing.
(f)
Should the board of commissioners place the matter down for hearing, the board shall provide the licensee not less than three days notice of the date of the hearing. In all hearings held pursuant to this section, the proceedings shall be as informal as compatible with justice, the hearing shall not exceed 30 minutes in length, and the following procedures shall prevail:
(1)
The charges and specifications against the licensee and the response as filed by the licensee shall be read.
(2)
The county representative shall present evidence, and then the licensee shall present his evidence, with opportunity for each party to present rebuttal evidence, examination and cross examination of witnesses, and interrogation by the board of commissioners. No evidence shall be presented which is not relevant to the charges. The board of commissioners and the county administrator may consider mitigating and aggravating circumstances in considering sanctions.
(g)
After the hearing under this section if the board of commissioners determines due cause to exist, the board of commissioners may suspend, revoke or place on probation for a maximum of 12 months, with or without conditions, the license or holder. The board of commissioners may consider mitigating and aggravating circumstances in considering sanctions.
(h)
In the event a license to sell alcoholic beverages is suspended a sign issued by the business license office shall be placed at each entrance to the facility wherein alcoholic beverages were sold with the sign providing, "THE LICENSE TO SELL ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ISSUED TO THE OWNER AND LICENSEE OF THIS BUSINESS HAS BEEN SUSPENDED FROM _________ TO _________ AS A RESULT OF SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES TO AN UNDERAGE PERSON, AN INTOXICATED PERSON OR AN UNAUTHORIZED SUNDAY SALE." In the event a license to sell alcoholic beverages is revoked a sign issued by the business license office shall be placed at each entrance to the facility wherein alcoholic beverages were sold with the sign providing, "THE LICENSE TO SELL ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ISSUED TO THE OWNER AND LICENSEE OF THIS BUSINESS HAS BEEN REVOKED AS A RESULT OF SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES TO AN UNDERAGE PERSON, AN INTOXICATED PERSON OR AN UNAUTHORIZED SUNDAY SALE." The sign shall stay in place for the period of suspension or in the case of a revocation for a period of 30 days.
