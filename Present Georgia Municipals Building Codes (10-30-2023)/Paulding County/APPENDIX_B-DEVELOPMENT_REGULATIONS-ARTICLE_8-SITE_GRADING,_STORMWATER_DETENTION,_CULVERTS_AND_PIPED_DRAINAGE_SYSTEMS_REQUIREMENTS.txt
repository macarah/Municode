ARTICLE 8 - SITE GRADING, STORMWATER DETENTION, CULVERTS AND PIPED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS REQUIREMENTS

8.1 - Site grading.
8.1.1 General requirements.
1)
Grading shall be done in accordance with the lines and grades shown on the approved construction plans.
2)
Embankments shall be placed in uniform layers not to exceed a compacted thickness of six inches per layer and shall be compacted to a density of 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry weight per cubic foot as determined by AASHTO Method T-99 in all areas where structures, parking lots and drives, streets, and utilities are to be placed. All other embankments are to be compacted to at least 85 percent.
3)
The maximum slopes for cut or fill shall be 2:1 (two feet of horizontal run for each foot of rise or fall). The depth of cut referred to herein shall be the maximum cut or fill occurring in any one section of cut or fill. The slope of cut or fill shall be uniform throughout for each section of cut or fill except when the development control committee approves benching. When a cut is made in rock that requires blasting, the slope may be steeper if pre-splitting is employed and upon submission of a geotechnical report which substantiates the integrity of the rock in the steeper condition, subject to the review and approval of the development control committee.
4)
While most soils in the area can be safely stabilized at a 2:1 slope, some soils exhibit a low shearing resistance and a low cohesiveness. These soils typically are micaceous silts and sandy soils with little or no clay. If the 2:1 slope shows evidence of shearing, noncohesiveness, sliding, or inability to maintain compaction, the slope shall be stabilized at 3:1 or by using such mechanical methods as needed (such as retaining walls or "grow mats" stapled in place) to maintain slope, height and integrity.
8.2 - Stormwater detention.
8.2.1 Stormwater management report required.
1)
Every project shall provide a stormwater management report prepared by a professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia. The purpose of this report shall be to formulate a plan to manage stormwater runoff so that stormwater runoff hazards are not created and existing runoff-related problems are not exacerbated, either upstream or downstream from or within the boundaries of the property being developed.
2)
The stormwater management report shall include a written narrative and shall identify the locations and quantities of stormwater runoff entering and exiting the site for both pre- and post-developed conditions. Analysis of the off-site properties shall anticipate future development in addition to addressing existing conditions. It shall contain drainage area delineation maps and other exhibits at satisfactory scale and sufficient in quantity and scope to define the boundaries of the site relative to watercourses, drainage divides, drainage structures, and other pertinent features.
3)
The analysis of downstream conditions in the report shall address each and every point or area along the project site's boundaries at which runoff will exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion of the drainage way "immediately" downstream from, the project. This area shall generally extend a flow distance of about one-half mile from the project's boundary line, but shall be longer for projects contributing relatively large amounts of runoff to the study area, and shorter for small runoff contributions. In all cases, the most critical downstream area investigation shall be conducted relative to existing and anticipated land uses on tracts that adjoin the project site.
8.2.2 Stormwater detention required.
1)
If the stormwater management report indicates that adverse stormwater runoff is expected to result from the development of a property, that project shall be required to provide stormwater detention facilities. These detention facilities shall be designed so that their peak release rates, when combined with those of all detention bypass areas in the same basin, produce peak flow rates and flow velocities at the site's boundary line no greater than those which occurred at the same location for pre-developed conditions.
2)
The following criteria shall be evaluated by the engineer preparing the stormwater management report, or the calculations and documents required may be performed and submitted by a registered land surveyor, licensed in the State of Georgia, and in determining whether or not detention should be required for any portion of any site:
(a)
Existing land uses downstream.
(b)
Anticipated future land uses downstream.
(c)
Magnitude of increase in peak flows due to development.
(d)
Presence of existing drainage problems.
(e)
Capacity of existing and anticipated drainage systems.
(f)
Creation of concentrated flows where none had occurred previously.
(g)
Availability of feasible locations for detention facilities.
(h)
Existing flows generated off-site that pass through the project site.
(i)
Anticipated future flows generated off-site that pass through the project site.
(j)
The nature of the receiving watercourse.
3)
Stormwater detention facilities shall be required for any portion of any site for which development activities will result in increased flows, unless the registered professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia certifies and provides documentation supporting the conclusion to the development control committee that the following is true and correct as applicable:
(a)
The nondetained, post-development runoff will leave the project site as sheet flow, and will not have an adverse impact upon downstream properties.
(b)
The effect of detention would be to concentrate flows where sheet flow had occurred under pre-developed conditions, and any impact of increase sheet flows upon downstream properties would be less adverse than that which would result from the concentrated flows from a detention facility even if energy dissipation devices were employed.
(c)
The runoff will flow directly into a floodplain without crossing off-site properties, and the runoff will constitute less than five percent of the total runoff in the watercourse at the point where the watercourse crosses the project site's downstream property line.
(d)
The undetained flow will pass through downstream properties, in drainage easements obtained by the developer, to an existing detention facility that has been designed to manage the additional upstream property's runoff.
4)
In the event that the professional engineer has concluded that stormwater detention may not be necessary as outlined in subsection 8.2.2 (c) above is anticipated, a pre-design conference with the development control committee shall be required before the submittal of plans. Fees shall be collected at the rate of $3,700.00 per impervious acre of the proposed project to be used for capital drainage improvements.
8.2.3 Detention design criteria; general.
1)

3)
A variety of methods of achieving stormwater-management goals shall be acceptable in providing detention facilities. The type of facility provided shall be based on the following criteria:
(a)
The type of development for which the detention facility is being provided.
(b)
The type of development which the detention facility is intended to protect.
(c)
Volume of stormwater to be stored.
(d)
Origin and magnitude of the flows to be managed.
(e)
Topographic opportunities and limitations.
(f)
Safety considerations.
(g)
Maintenance requirements.

Aesthetic considerations.
(i)
Likelihood of facility operation interfering with access to public or private facilities.
(j)
Proximity of facility to property lines, utilities, buffers, etc.
(k)
Similar site-specific constraints.
4)
Detention facilities may be of any of the following types, and two or more types may be used in combination with one another:

Likewise, adequate support must be provided for all composite runoff coefficients or curve numbers used.
9)
If a computer program is used for detention design, including generating and routing hydrographs, the output from the program shall be summarized in the stormwater management report, and the name and version of the program shall be indicated. Computer output sheets may be attached to the report if desired by the design engineer or if requested by the community development department.
10)
The design of every detention facility of any type shall consider the effects both of inflows in excess of those the facility is designed to accommodate and of malfunctioning of the primary outlet system. A safe path for overflow condition flows shall be provided.
