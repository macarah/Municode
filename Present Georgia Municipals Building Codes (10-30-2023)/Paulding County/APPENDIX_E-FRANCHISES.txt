The licensee shall be solely responsible for ascertaining widths of rights-of-way on county streets and alleys. For the purpose of complying with the above, the licensee shall carry property damage and public liability insurance in some responsible insurance company or companies qualified to do business in the State of Georgia, in the following amounts:

In each of said policies the county shall be named as an insured and a copy of each policy or a certificate of insurance shall be delivered to and retained by the county.

Rates shall be reasonable and shall be the same for such classifications of customers as are served from identical facilities. All services to be provided hereunder shall be the option of the individual citizen of the county. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as to require the licensee, without adequate compensation, to serve any subscriber so far removed from the licensee facilities that a new pole or poles will be required to furnish said service.

If the repairs are not promptly made by the licensee, the county, after reasonable notice to the licensee, may make such repairs as it may deem necessary and charge the same to the licensee.
(b)
In the event that at any time during the period of this franchise the county shall lawfully elect to alter or change any street, alley, easement, or other public way requiring the relocation of the facilities of the licensee, then in such event the licensee, upon reasonable notice by the county, shall remove, relay, and relocate the same at the expense of the licensee.

The person holding such permit shall be required to give the licensee reasonable notice of the time and place of the proposed move. The licensee shall not be required to raise or lower its lines at an unreasonable time or at a time that would impose an undue hardship on the licensee. The expense of such temporary removal shall be paid by the person requesting the same and the licensee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance.
(d)
The licensee shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging all streets, alleys, easements, sidewalks, and public places of the county so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming into contact with the facilities of the licensee.

The licensee's poles, wires, cables, conductors, and appliances in each and every location shall be located, erected, attached, connected, constructed, and maintained in strict conformity with all of the provisions of the National Electrical Safety Code, sixth edition, and any amendments or revisions of said code and in compliance with any rules or orders now in effect or that hereafter may be issued or adopted by the county, its duly authorized officers and agents or any other authority having jurisdiction.
5.
Term of franchise.
This franchise shall take effect and be in full force from and after the date of the passage of this ordinance and the same shall continue in full force and effect for a term of twenty (20) years.

Assignment.
(a)
All of the rights and privileges and all of the obligations, duties, and liabilities created by this franchise shall pass to and be binding upon the successors of the county and the successors and assigns of the licensee, and the same shall not be assigned or transferred without a written notice to and approval of the county.
8.
Requirements to render service.
After installing the basic facilities, the licensee will render regular daily service during customary hours of television broadcasting.
9.
Quality service.
The licensee will undertake to use its best efforts to render satisfactory service to each paid voluntary subscriber within the county. In the event that the licensee, after receiving the initial installation fee from a customer, fails or refuses to render any service within a reasonable time, considering the state of construction and/or conditions beyond the control of the licensee, the county may by written notice, require the initial installation charge be refunded to the customer. To insure compliance with this provision, the licensee shall post a good and sufficient bond conditioned upon the licensee making the refunds as described above pursuant to the order of the county. The amounts of such bond shall never exceed the sum of $25,000.00 and such bond shall not be required in any amount for any purpose after the expiration of two (2) years from the receipt by the licensee of the first initial connection charge and provided further that in lieu of surety on said bond, the licensee may make such bond without surety and it may pledge as security a deposit of funds of the licensee in any bank or savings and loan association in the county, which deposit shall at all times equal the total potential liability of the licensee under the terms of the bond, not exceeding, however, the total sum of $25,000.00. Before collecting any funds from customers the licensee shall post a bond or establish an account as aforesaid in the amount of $5,000.00. Thereafter, installation fees collected shall be deposited to the account or a similar amount added to the bond until the amount of the bond or the amount of the deposit equals $25,000.00. All interest accruing on any such deposit shall inure to the licensee.
10.
As part of the consideration for this license and upon request from the county, licensee shall provide six (6) cost free connections at such locations as the county and licensee might mutually agree upon. The licensee shall also provide at least one educational television channel to its subscribers.
In addition, licensee shall also provide a channel for community interest programming, including special events, sports events, public meetings and community interest news events and shall provide the necessary facilities for videotaping and transmission of such events to its subscribers, both through audio and visual image signals.

11.
This license is a nonexclusive license.
12.
The licensee shall at all times operate in compliance with any applicable regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, now in effect or hereafter adopted, regulating the operation of community antenna systems.
13.
Licensees do not obligate themselves to construct these facilities but merely request the right to do so after the necessary feasibility studies and analysis of other pertinent preliminary date. If licensees have not begun actual construction of these facilities within thirty-six (36) months from this date, this franchise agreement shall be null and void and have no effect. In the event construction of the facilities referred to in this ordinance are prevented by reason of FCC regulations or state or federal law, the time construction thus prevented will not count in the thirty-six (36) months referred to in this paragraph.

If the two (2) appraisers are unable to agree upon a third appraiser, one shall be appointed by the state court which has jurisdiction over disputes arising in Paulding County, Georgia. The three (3) appraisers so selected shall then proceed to appraise licensee's distribution system as a going concern business in accordance with the procedures set forth above and shall deliver such appraisals on or before the expiration of the aforesaid ninety (90) day period. The purchase price shall be determined by averaging the two (2) highest appraisals. The costs of such appraisals shall be shared equally by the county and the licensee."

Paragraph 7 entitled "Assignment" in the franchise agreement granted on September 26, 1978, shall be modified by inserting the following new subparagraph (b):

"1. The county hereby approves of and consents to the financing of the system and approved of and consents to the collateral assignment of, grant of a security interest in, or other encumbrance of all or any part of the right, title, and interest of Tele-Media Company of Paulding County under and in the ordinance and all amendments or modifications thereto and in the franchise and system, including without limitation all of the assets, property, franchise rights and interests of Tele-Media Company of Paulding County, to any lender pursuant to one or more security agreements or other collateral documents, including without limitation, security deeds.

Licensee shall be and is hereby given an option to renew this franchise for an additional twenty (20) year period under the same terms and conditions as set out herein upon the giving of written notice to the county thirty days prior to the time period covered by this ordinance.
(b)
At the expiration of the term for which this franchise is granted or at the expiration of the twenty year renewal period, whichever is later, or upon its cancellation, the county, at its election, shall have the option for a period of thirty (30) days to purchase and take over licensee's distribution system in its entirety (the option). Upon the exercise of its option by the county and its service of an official notice of such action upon the licensee, the county shall have ninety (90) days in which to reach a definitive purchase agreement with the licensee. The transfer to the county of the possession and title to all the equipment and property, real and personal, of the distribution system has been paid to the licensee, whereupon any grant conferred upon the licensee by this ordinance shall cease and determine [terminate]. The following factors shall be taken into account in determining the purchase price of the distribution system as a going concern business (the purchase price):

(b)
The then current highest market value of such equipment and property as used as an integral part of the distribution system;
(c)
The purchase price paid for the purchase of systems comparable to licensee's distribution system; and

During the aforesaid ninety (90) day period, if any disagreement shall arise between the licensee and the county with respect to the calculation of the purchase price for licensee's distribution system, the licensee and the county shall each appoint an appraiser and the two appraisers shall in turn appoint a third appraiser. If the two appraisers are unable to agree upon a third appraiser, one shall be appointed by the state court which has jurisdiction over disputes arising in Paulding County, Georgia. The three appraisers so selected shall then proceed to appraise licensee's distribution system as a going concern business in accordance with the procedures set forth above and shall deliver such appraisals on or before the expiration of the aforesaid ninety (90) day period. The purchase price shall be determined by averaging the two highest appraisals. The cost of such appraisals shall be shared equally by the county and licensee.

9.
Quality service.
The licensee will undertake to use its best efforts to render satisfactory service to each paid voluntary subscriber within the county. In the event that the licensee, after receiving the initial installation fee from a customer, fails or refuses to render any service within a reasonable time, considering the state of construction and/or conditions beyond the control of the licensee, the county may by written notice, require the initial installation charge be refunded to the customer. To insure compliance with this provision upon written request of the county, the licensee shall post a good and sufficient bond conditioned upon the licensee making the refunds as described above pursuant to the order of the county. The amounts of such bond shall never exceed the sum of $25,000.00 and such bond shall not be required in any amount for any purpose after the expiration of two (2) years from the receipt by the licensee of the first initial connection charge and provided further that in lieu of surety on said bond, the licensee may make such bond without surety and it may pledge as security a deposit of funds of the licensee in any bank or savings and loan association in the county, which deposit shall at all times equal the total potential liability of the licensee under the terms of the bond, not exceeding, however, the total sum of $25,000.00.

12.
The licensee shall at all times operate in compliance with any applicable regulations of the Federal Communication Commission, now in effect or hereafter adopted, regulating the operation of community antenna systems.
13.
Licensees do not obligate themselves to construct these facilities but merely request the right to do so after the necessary feasibility studies and analysis of other pertinent preliminary data. If licensees have not begun actual construction of these facilities within 36 months of this date, this franchise agreement shall be null and void and have no effect. In the event construction of the facilities referred to in this ordinance are prevented by reason of FCC Regulations or state or federal law, the time construction thus prevented will not count in the 36 months referred to in this paragraph.
14.
The effective date of this ordinance shall be the date of its passage.
