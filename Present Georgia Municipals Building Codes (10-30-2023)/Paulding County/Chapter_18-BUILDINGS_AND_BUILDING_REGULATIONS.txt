(f)
Unsafe buildings or systems. All buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems that are unsafe, unsanitary, or do not provide adequate egress, or that constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing use, constitute a hazard to safety or health, are considered unsafe buildings or service systems.

(c)
Special foundation permit. When the application for permit to erect or enlarge a building has been filed and pending issuance of such permit, the county building official may, at his discretion, issue a special permit for the foundation only.

Corrections may be required in order to meet provisions of the technical codes.
(d)
Public right-of-way. A permit shall not be given by the county building official for the construction of any building, or for the alteration of any building where such building is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies, or other appendages or projections fronting on any street, alley or public lane, or for the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises, unless the applicant has made application at the county department of transportation for the lines of the public street on which he proposes to build, erect or locate such building; and it shall be the duty of the county building official to see that the street lines are not encroached upon.
