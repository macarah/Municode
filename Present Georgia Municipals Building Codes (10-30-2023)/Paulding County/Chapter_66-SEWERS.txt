(c)
In addition, the owner/developer of a subdivision/development which requires sewer in accordance with this division or the county zoning ordinance is also responsible for acquiring the necessary permits, including, but not limited to, encroachment permits, for any county and/or state right-of-way along which such sewer lines shall be placed.
(d)
In the event the owner/developer of a subdivision/development which is required to connect to sewer in accordance with this division, under the county zoning ordinance, or, who otherwise proposes to connect to sewer is unsuccessful in acquiring the easements across private property which are necessary for the installation of sewer for connection, the county, at the discretion of the board of commissioners, may assist the owner/developer in obtaining the sewer line easements, including the use of the power of eminent domain, pursuant to the following procedures:
(1)
Prior to intervention by Paulding County in the easement acquisition, the owner/developer shall first make a minimum of four documented written attempts to acquire the easement. Said offers to property owners must be made in writing, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or must be acknowledged as received by a notarized statement from the property owner. All such offers must be made in good faith illustrating a genuine attempt to acquire the easement through negotiation. Fifteen days shall elapse between the date of the first and second offers and an additional 15 days must elapse between each subsequent written offer. The second of the documented attempts to purchase the property must include obtaining an opinion of fair market value in a written real estate appraisal from a licensed real estate appraiser certified by the State of Georgia of said easement area and offering the fair market value as indicated by the appraisal, to said private property owner. Said real estate appraisal must include a full fair market valuation of the site, including a consequential damages, consequential benefits analysis.
(2)
The owner/developer shall submit the request for county intervention in the acquisition of the easements in writing to the director of water systems in a form substantially like the form as set forth in the County Code of Ordinances section 66-130, accompanied with a nonrefundable $5,000.00 application fee. The owner/developer must also submit a copy of the real estate appraiser's full report of opinion of fair market value of the easement and the documentation, including the certified mail and receipt forms or the notarized acknowledgment forms as to all acquisition attempts. In addition, the owner/developer will submit four plats of survey for each easement wherein intervention is requested, as well as four copies of the preliminary engineering design and specifications of the sewer line and two copies of the sewer profile.
(3)
The owner/developer must also submit an engineering report from an independent engineering firm stating that the proposed easement route is the most feasible route. Said report must contain the supporting data for this conclusion and must be written by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Georgia. At the request of public works, the county may require a meeting with the independent engineer to review his plans and conclusions.
(4)
If deemed necessary by the director of water systems, the owner/developer shall meet with the director of water systems and county attorney or their designees to discuss the request for intervention. The director of water systems, in reviewing the request, may require the owner/developer to size the line to accommodate the public good if the location of the line is such that public connection to the line from outside the owner/developer's project is likely.
(5)
After reviewing the submission, the water system director and/or county attorney may require the owner/developer to continue negotiations with the owner/developer for a further period, to be determined by the county on a case by case basis. In doing so, the water system director and/or county attorney may require the owner/developer to schedule at least one in-person meeting with the easement landowner that must occur prior to any further county involvement and may also require the owner/developer to obtain a second independent land appraisal of the easement area from a different appraiser at the owner/developer's expense. The county attorney may, at his discretion, select the second appraisal firm. The second appraisal shall meet the appraisal requirements set forth above.

The county attorney may act as the easement negotiation agent.
(7)
In the event no resolution is reached during the easement conference, the parties shall be required to attend a further mediation regarding the easement. A member of the county staff and/or county attorney are not required to attend the mediation, but may do so if scheduling allows and if so requested. The mediation shall be conducted by one of the licensed mediators on the nondomestic mediators' list for the 7th Judicial Circuit. The mediator shall be selected utilizing the following method: The owner/developer shall select three licensed mediators and present those choices to the property owners. The property owners may select any name from the list of three. Provided however, in the event the parties are unable to reach an agreement as to whom the mediator should be, the county attorney will randomly assign a mediator from the 7th Judicial Circuit list of mediators on a rotating basis.
The parties shall attend mediation and work towards a solution in good faith. The owner/developer shall be responsible for the cost of the mediator's fees and will be responsible for payment at the time of mediation. The mediator shall supply the county attorney with a copy of the mediation report and/or mediation agreement showing the outcome of the mediation.
(8)
In the event no resolution is reached, the director of water systems and the county attorney shall review the results of the mediation and the aspects of the matter further and determine whether any further negotiations should be required. Thereafter, if the water system director and county attorney determine that all privately held mediation and negotiation attempts have failed, the water system director shall present the issue to the water and sewer advisory board for their recommendation regarding whether intervention in the acquisition of the easement is in the best interest of the county at the next available regularly scheduled meeting of the water and sewer advisory board.
The owner/developer and property owners shall both be advised of the date and time of the water and sewer advisory board meeting and provided an opportunity to be heard. The water and sewer advisory board may establish its own rules regarding the length and nature of any such presentations. In making its decision, the water and sewer advisory board shall consider whether there is a compelling public interest in acquiring the easement though county intervention. The water and sewer advisory board may make a determination as follows: (1) that it is not in the county's best interest to move forward with assisting in the easement acquisition process; (2) that it is in the county's best interest to move forward with assisting in the acquisition process; (3) the issue should be tabled to the water and sewer advisory board for further review. The water and sewer advisory board may table the issues to seek further information from any source, to allow the staff more time to review alternate routes, and/or to request the owner/developer and property owner continue further negotiations. In the event the water and sewer advisory board requests further negotiations or information, the owner/developer must provide the information requested to Paulding County Public Works at least one week prior to the scheduled decision meeting and the owner/developer must appear before the water and sewer advisory board at the scheduled meeting to discuss the information and its further attempts at resolution. Thereafter, the water and sewer advisory board, at its discretion, may continue to table an item to a time certain or vote as set forth above.
The water and sewer advisory board may offer any further recommendations it deems appropriate to the board of commissioners.
(9)
After the water and sewer advisory board has issued its recommendation regarding the request, the director of water systems shall place this matter on the agenda and present the issue to the board of commissioners (if the owner/developer desires to proceed with the request) at a future, available board of commissioners' regularly scheduled meeting. The findings and recommendations of the water and sewer advisory board will be presented to the board of commissioners in conjunction with the director of water systems' presentation. In addition, the county attorney shall be available to present to the board of commissioners a report of the previous findings from the easement conferences.
(10)
The board of commissioners will consider the request and vote on the request for intervention in the acquisition of the easement at a public meeting. The owner/developer requesting same and the property owners affected will be notified of the time and place of the meeting in which the request will be considered. In its decision, the board of commissioners shall consider whether there is a compelling public interest in the acquisition of the easement through county intervention. The board of commissioners may vote as follows: (1) to continue assistance in the acquisition of the easement, including instituting an action pursuant to the power of eminent domain to acquire the easement, (2) to continue assistance in the acquisition, but reserve the issue of the use of eminent domain after further discussions between the owner/developer, county and property owner have been completed; (3) to deny the request for assistance from the owner/developer; (4) to table the request for assistance and (5) any other appropriate motion it deems proper. The board of commissioners may table the issue to seek further information from any source, to allow the staff more time to review alternate routes and/or to request the owner/developer and property owner continue further negotiations. Thereafter, the board of commissioners, at its discretion, may continue to table the request to a time certain or vote as set forth above.
(11)
The final decision to intervene and assist in easement acquisition is at the sole discretion of the board of commissioners. Nothing in this section shall be construed as to give the owner/developer a property interest or right to the county's assistance in the easement acquisition process nor shall it give any such right to a time frame or schedule for assistance at any stage of the process.
(12)
Should any discrepancy exist between the terms contained in subsection (a)(1) entitled "connection to county sewer", and the county development regulations, the terms of this section shall control.
(e)
In addition to the application fee, the developer submitting the request for easement acquisition assistance shall be responsible for the payment of the following costs and expenses:
(1)
The cost of acquisition of the rights in and to the easement from the landowner as may be agreed upon by the parties or as may be determined by judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction;
(2)
Any and all attorney's fees and expenses resulting from the negotiation, mediation and or any other such attorney services conducted by the county attorney or their representative with regard to the easement acquisition;

(8)
Such other and further fees, costs and expenses as may be reasonably incurred by Paulding County in the easement acquisition process.
All such fees must be paid promptly within 30 days of an invoice for said fees being presented to owner/developer. All checks must be made payable to the Paulding County Board of Commissioners, except those paid as judgments or costs of land acquisition, which may be paid directly to the property owner.
