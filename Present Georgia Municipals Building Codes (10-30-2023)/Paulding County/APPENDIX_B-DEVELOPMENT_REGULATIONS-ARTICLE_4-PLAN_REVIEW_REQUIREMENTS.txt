2)
All information requested on applications for plat or plan review must be provided; incomplete applications will not be accepted. Likewise all plats and plans must contain the minimum information outlined in this article. The absence of necessary design data shall result in plats and plans being resubmitted for a future plan review date.

4.1.2 Pre-application conference (optional).
1)
Whenever any subdivision or development of a tract of land is proposed to be made, whether residential or nonresidential in nature, the developer is encouraged to present to the development control committee preliminary documents and graphic exhibits to allow early evaluation of the developer's intentions as well as coordination with the comprehensive plan, zoning ordinance and other county regulations.
2)
A pre-application conference can be scheduled through the community development department for each Thursday. The request for a pre-application conference must be by calling the department by 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday of the preceding week (in other words, eight days prior to the requested conference date).

4.1.3 Water pressure, flow test, and fire hydrant spacing requirements for preliminary plat approval. (Revised 2001)
1)
A water pressure and flow test shall be conducted and approved by Paulding County before applying for preliminary plat review and approval as described in section 4.1.4 below. An approved water pressure and flow test is defined as a corrected flow rate (Q C ) that meets the minimum fire flow rate as outlined in the table below.
2)
In addition to any other preliminary plat requirements, the following information shall be provided on the preliminary plat; tested flow rate (Q T ), pressure recording chart (minimum 24-hour, however, pressure recording duration may be increased at the discretion of the water and sewer system director), static pressure, residual pressure, tested hydrant location, tested hydrant elevation, date of field flow test measurements, computed available flow rate (Q A ) at the field tested hydrant, corrected flow rate (Q C ) for the proposed development location, all associated computations, and the appropriate hydrant spacing in accordance with the table below.
3)
The tested flow rate (Q T ), shall be computed the using the orifice equation below based on the actual field measurements:
QT= [27 (d)2(P)0.5] * k
Where:
Q T (gpm) = tested flow rate at the pilot location, reported in gallons per minute
d (in) = orifice diameter tested, typically 2.5 inches
P (psi) = pilot pressure measured in the flow stream
k (unitless) = flow discharge efficiency factor, generally accepted to be 0.90
4)
The available flow rate (Q A ) shall be computed by adjusting the tested flow rate at the pilot location for the minimum allowable residual pressure (20-psi), deviations in hydrant testing elevations, low hydraulic grade line conditions (corrected at 50 percent of the tank overflow elevation), and the sustained 24-hr pressure (pump-off) conditions. The available flow rate (Q A ) shall be computed using the following equation:
QA= { ([s' -20)/(S - R)]0.54} * QT
Where:
Q A (gpm) = available flow rate at the pilot location, adjusted for local field conditions
s' (psi) = static pressure adjusted for low hydraulic grade line conditions
S (psi) = static pressure prior to hydrant flow test
R (psi) = residual pressure during hydrant flow test
5)
The minimum fire flow rate used to design a proposed development shall correspond to the corrected flow rate (qc) that has been projected to the proposed development. The corrected flow rate (qc) shall be computed by adjusting the available flow rate (qa) to reflect conditions at the proposed development site. Corrected flows may be projected from the nearest water distribution main where the field measured flow test was performed to a proposed development location using accepted hydraulic engineering design practices that account for changes in elevation head, frictional losses through meters, etc.
6)
Minimum fire flow and maximum hydrant spacing shall be completed in compliance with the chart below.

  a.
Minimum flow may be upwardly adjusted based upon the written recommendation of the county fire chief setting forth any special /conditions of the development which require additional flow.
b.

In the event the corrected flow rate for a proposed development is less than the minimum required flow rate in the minimum fire flow and hydrant spacing table above, an owner/developer may elect to propose off-site improvements to the water distribution system that would result in an increase in the corrected flow rate (qc). All proposed system improvements shall be designed by an independent professional engineer at the expense of the owner/developer. The proposed improvements shall be reviewed by the water and sewer system department and authorized by the water and sewer system director. Any approved off-site improvements shall be described on the preliminary plat prior to preliminary plat review and approval as described in section 4.1.4 below.
7)
