Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area means a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "The Natural Environments of Georgia."

River corridor.
(1)
The term "river corridor" means all land, including islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq., or the Coastal Marshland Protection Act of 1970, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq., in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks.
(2)
The 100 feet buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100 feet wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by local governments in the same manner as the river corridor.
(3)
Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purpose of this chapter, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed as its position at the beginning of each review period for the local comprehensive plan as established by the department of community affairs. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next review by the department of community affairs.
River corridor protection plan means that part of the Porterdale Comprehensive Plan that deals with river corridor protection as required by the Georgia Planning Act of 1989 (O.C.G.A. §§ 50-8-7.1, 50-8-7.2).
Riverbank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow.
Sensitive natural area means any area, as identified now or hereafter by the department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following:
(1)
Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species;
(2)
Rare or exemplary natural communities;
(3)
Significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or
(4)
Other areas so designated by the department of natural resources and which is sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration.
Single-family dwelling means a dwelling structure that is designed for use by one family.
Surface mining means any activity constituting all or part of a process for the removal of minerals, ores, and dimension stone, and other solid matter for sale or for processing or for consumption in the regular operation of a business.

Sec. 111-2. - Purpose.
(a)
This section provides for the protection of river corridors and the regulation of activities in or adjacent to those corridors; provides for the powers and duties of City of Porterdale and other governmental entities; provides for goals, guidelines, practices, procedures, policies, rules, and regulations; provides for minimum standards for regulated activities within river corridors and their buffers which natural resources of the county are of vital importance to this county and its citizens; provides for a review of decision; provides for hearings and judicial review; provides for enforcement; prohibits certain activities or actions; provides for civil and other penalties; repeals conflicting ordinances; and other proposes.
(b)
The State of Georgia has determined that its river corridors are of vital importance in that they help preserve those qualities that made a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors are fragile natural resources subject to flood, erosion, soil-bearing capacity limitation, and other natural and human induced hazards. In their natural state they serve multiple functions for pollution control, aquifer recharge and discharge, storage and passage of floodwater, and erosion and sedimentation control, as well as wildlife habitat, education, scientific study, open space and recreation, and scenic and aesthetic beauty.
(c)
The Georgia Planning Act of 1989 (O.C.G.A. §§ 50-8-7.1, 50-8-7.2) provides for the development of coordinated and comprehensive planning by municipal and county governments. Such comprehensive plans shall consider the natural resources, environments, and vital areas within the jurisdiction of the local governments. Additionally, O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 authorizes the department of natural resources to develop minimum planning standards and procedures for the protection of river corridors in the state and requires local government to use these minimum standards in developing and implementing, local comprehensive plans, the method mandated in O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 for protecting river corridors is establishing a natural vegetative buffer bordering each protected river. In October, 1993, a river corridor protection plan was developed as authorized in O.C.G.A. § 36-70-3 to maintain the integrity of the Yellow River.
