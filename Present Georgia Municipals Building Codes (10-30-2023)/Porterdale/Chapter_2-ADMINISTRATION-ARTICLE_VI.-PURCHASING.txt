Sec. 2-340. - Intent.
The purpose of this article is to provide guidance for the procurement of goods and services in compliance with procurement provisions of the city and the State of Georgia. The goal of this article is to establish, foster, and maintain the following principles:
(1)
To consider the best interests of the city in all transactions.
(2)
To purchase without prejudice, seeking to obtain the maximum value for each dollar expenditure with maximum quality standards.
(3)
To subscribe to and work for honesty and truth in buying.
(Code 2003, § 4-401(5)(A))
Sec. 2-341. - Vendors.
The city will make every effort to obtain high quality goods and services at the best possible price. All procurement procedures will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner with avoidance of any impropriety. All qualified vendors have access to city business. No bidder will be arbitrarily or capriciously excluded. It is the intent of the city that competition be sought to the greatest practical degree. The conditions of the contract shall be made clear in advance of the competition. Specifications shall reflect the needs of the city.
(1)
Solicitation of vendors and submission of bids.
a.
When a purchase for a single good is expected to exceed $10,000.00, competition is required to the extent that it exists. Each department must attempt to obtain a minimum of three bids from different sources. If three sources are not possible, the seeker of the bid must attempt to obtain as many vendors as possible. Each department head shall document the competitive bidding process with records of the vendor and bids received.
b.
Each department has full authority to determine and obtain professional and contractual services as provided for in the budget. When possible and practical, competitive quotes for professional and contractual services should be obtained. If competitive quotes are not possible, the city manager must be notified in writing. Each department head shall document the process.
(2)
Interest of city officials in expenditure of public funds. No official of the City of Porterdale will be interested directly or indirectly in any transaction with, sale to, work for, or contract of the city or any department of government or service involving the expenditure of public funds in violation of section 2-122. The city shall not use a vendor who is a member of the immediate family of a city commissioner, city attorney, city manager, assistant city manager, a department head, personnel officer, or payroll clerk. The city shall not use a vendor for services in an operating department who is a member of the immediate family of an employee of that operating department.
(3)
Request for proposal. It is suggested that, whenever appropriate, a request for proposal (RFP) process be used for procuring products and services. The RFP should specify the service, evaluation criteria, and terms and conditions required by the city. Large purchases should be advertised in the legal organ and other venues as time and advertising funds allow.
(4)
Award of bids. Bids are awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. A responsive bid is one that conforms in all material respects to the need of the city. Responsible means a bidder who has the capability to perform the requirements.
(5)
Local bidder preference. If all other relevant factors are met, each department is authorized to negotiate with and select a local vendor if the local vendor's bid is within ten percent of the lowest offer. A current City of Porterdale business license is required to be considered as a local vendor.
(6)
Equal opportunity. The City of Porterdale will provide an equal opportunity for all businesses to participate in city contracts regardless of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, political affiliation, age, handicapped status, sexual orientation, sexual preference, or transgender status. The city will actively seek to ensure that minority owned and operated firms have the opportunity to participate in the purchasing process, including bidding, negotiations and contract awards. The city will not knowingly conduct business with contractors that discriminate or permit discrimination against persons because of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, political affiliation, age, handicapped status, sexual orientation, sexual preference, or transgender status.
(7)
Ineligible vendors. Any person, firm, or corporation who is in arrears to the city for taxes, or otherwise, will not be qualified to bid on any purchase until their lien to the city has been cleared. No requisition will be approved for such vendors.
(8)
State contracts. The city is authorized to use state contracts in lieu of issuing bids to vendors or buying locally when it is to the economic advantage of the city or deemed appropriate by the city manager. The state contract price may be used to establish the maximum price for a good or service.
(9)
Backup policy and emergency purchases.
a.
The city should strive to decrease dependency on single-source vendors in order to achieve maximum efficiency in its purchases. In order to achieve the city's fiscal independence, it is strongly suggested that each department have backup vendors for each recurring and/or large purchase.
b.
In cases of emergency, a contract may be awarded without competitive bidding, but the procurement shall be made with as much competition as the circumstances allow (i.e., informal quotes). An emergency is defined as a threat to life or property, or an unforeseen situation that curtails or greatly diminishes an essential service as determined by the city manager. In the event of an emergency, the city manager shall be contacted.
