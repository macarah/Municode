DIVISION 2. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES

Sec. 18-101. - Findings of fact.
(a)
Sexually oriented businesses require special supervision in order to protect and preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the patrons of such business as well as the citizens of the communities where they locate.
(b)
The mayor and council find that sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature.
(c)
The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the city that demands reasonable regulation of sexually oriented businesses in order to protect the health and well-being of the citizens.
(d)
Licensing is a legitimate means of accountability to ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
(e)
There is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values.
(f)
It is recognized that sexually oriented businesses, due to their nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when they are located in proximity to each other, thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area.
(g)
The mayor and council want to prevent these adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of urban blight.
(h)
It is not the intent of this division to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment, but to enact a content neutral division that addresses the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses as well as the health problems associated with such businesses.
(i)
It is not the intent of the mayor and council to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials, and the mayor and council recognize that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state enforcement officials to enforce state and federal obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in the city.
(Ord. of 1-13-1997)
Sec. 18-102. - Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose of this division to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. This division has neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this division to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this division to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.

DIVISION 3. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT
