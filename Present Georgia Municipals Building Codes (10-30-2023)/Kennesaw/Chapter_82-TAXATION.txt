Editor's note— Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1 the city has contracted with the county tax assessor to prepare the city's tax digest, access and collect city ad valorem taxes and invoke remedies permitted for collection of such taxes.
State Law reference— Ad valorem taxation of property, O.C.G.A. § 48-5-1 et seq.

Sec. 82-26. - Levied; rate.
An annual ad valorem tax upon all real and personal property within the city is hereby levied. The millage rate therefor shall be established each year by resolution of the mayor and council.
(Code 1986, § 3-2-1)
Sec. 82-27. - Taxation by city.
The city shall collect ad valorem taxes by notices of the amount due to all residents and property owners of the city. For purposes of chapter 82 of this Code, the term "finance director" shall mean the finance director and/or his or her designee.
(1)
Administration.
a.
Except as otherwise provided, the finance director or his or her designee shall be charged with the duty to administer the imposition, collection and enforcement of all taxes and special assessments levied or imposed by the city in accordance with the administrative procedures hereinafter set forth. Said designee may include, but is not limited to a private vendor to administer the imposition, collection and enforcement of all taxes and special assessments levied or imposed by the city. To the extent this Code section fails to provide a designated procedure, said officer shall act in the manner established, if any, for county tax collectors under applicable state law.
b.
In determining the fair market value of property within its taxing jurisdiction, the city shall use the fair market value as finally determined for the property for county ad valorem tax purposes.
c.
Following adoption of its current fiscal year budget, the mayor and council shall, by ordinance, adopt a millage rate upon which property subject to ad valorem tax will be billed. Prior to adoption of said millage rate, the governing body shall publish the notice of proposed ad valorem tax rate as required by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-32, as may be amended from time to time. Millage rates shall be calculated using 40 percent of the assessed fair market value of the property upon which the tax is levied.
d.
The finance director or his or her designee shall issue a bill to be sent to all taxpayers at the address last shown on the county tax digest by regular U.S. mail, with adequate postage thereon; provided, however, failure by the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for nonpayment or late payment of the tax. The bill shall state the location or description of the property taxed, 100 percent of the assessed fair market value of the property and its taxable value (40 percent of fair market value), and the amount of tax due thereon. The bill shall also state the due date after which taxes shall be in default. The bill may also contain such additional information as allowed by law or authorized by the mayor and council.
(2)
Due date; payment; interest on past due taxes.
a.
All ad valorem taxes shall be due and payable in full within 60 days after notice, unless the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which case it shall be postponed until the first day following which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. All payments must be United States postmarked no later than the due date. Supplemental ad valorem taxes and special assessments shall be due and payable on the date set forth in the ordinance imposing the tax or assessment.
b.
All taxes and assessments imposed by the city shall be paid in full in legal tender of the United States; except where specifically authorized by law or ordinance of the mayor and council.
c.
Taxes and special assessments shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to the bank prime loan rate as posted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in statistical release H. 15 or any publication that may supersede it, plus three percent, to accrue monthly from the date the tax or assessment is due until the date the tax or assessment is paid. Such annual interest rate shall be determined for each calendar year based on the first weekly posting of statistical release H. 15 on or after January 1 of each calendar year. For purposes of this section, any period of less than one month shall be considered to be one full month. The finance director or city manager may waive the collection of any interest, in whole or in part, due the city on unpaid taxes or assessments whenever or to the extent that he or she reasonably determines that the delay in payment was attributable to the action or inaction of his or her department.
(3)
Penalties.
a.
All penalties imposed herein are part of the tax or assessment and are to be collected as such. The proceedings to collect the original tax, the tax constituted from penalties imposed, and the interest shall all be conducted in the same manner. Any provision of law for criminal prosecution shall not operate to relieve any taxpayer of any tax, penalty, or interest imposed herein.
b.
In any instance in which any person willfully fails to pay, within 120 days of the date when due, any ad valorem tax owed the city, such person shall pay, in the absence of a specific statutory civil penalty for the failure, a penalty of five percent of the amount of tax due and not paid at the time such penalty is assessed, together with interest as specified by law. After 120 days from the imposition of the initial penalty, an additional penalty of five percent of any tax amount remaining due shall be imposed, together with interest as specified by law. If any tax amount remains due after 120 days from the imposition of such additional penalty, a penalty of five percent shall be imposed, together with interest as specified by law. Should any tax amount remain due 120 days after such date, a penalty of five percent shall be imposed, together with interest as specified by law. The aggregate amount of penalties imposed pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed an amount equal to 20 percent of the principal amount of the tax originally due.
c.
The finance director or city manager may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of any amount due as a penalty under this Code section to the extent said body finds and determines the default giving rise to the penalty was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect or disregard of this Code section.
(4)
Executions on delinquent taxes and assessments.
a.
As soon as the last day for the payment of taxes and assessments has arrived, the finance director or his or her designee shall notify in writing the taxpayer of the fact that the taxes have not been paid and that, unless paid within 30 days, an execution shall be issued.
b.
The finance director or his or her designee shall issue executions, for the nonpayment of taxes and assessments at any time after 30 days have elapsed since giving notice as provided in subsection (4)a. of this section. The execution shall identify the defendant in fi. fa., (taxpayer), the year(s) for which delinquent taxes are being executed, and the amount thereof. Executions shall be directed to "all and singular sheriffs and constables of the state" as required by O.C.G.A. § 48-3-3.
c.
The finance director or his or her designee shall cause all executions issued to be recorded on the general execution docket of the county where the property is located, in the case of real property, and, in the case of personal property, in the county of the taxpayer's residence if a resident of the state, otherwise in the county where any real or personal property of the taxpayer may be found. If the taxpayer is not a resident of the state and has no known real or personal property within the state, the execution shall be recorded in the county in which the act or activity giving rise to tax liability took place.
d.
All executions issued shall continue to bear interest and penalties at the rates established in this section for past due taxes and assessments.
e.
The finance director shall exercise his or her best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi. fa. In the event he or she is unable to do so, the finance director shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi. fa.'s property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this Code section.
(5)
Levy of executions; sale of property.
a.
The finance director is hereby designated as the duly authorized officer of the city for tax sales and delegated the duties set forth herein. The finance director shall be subject to being ruled for money in his or her hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the municipality. After first paying the city the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the finance director shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes, else to the defendant in fi. fa.
b.
In all cases of levying on real property, within five days' written notice of the levy must be given personally, or delivered by certified mail, to the defendant in fi. fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the finance director shall enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi. fa. therein.
c.
Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the finance director's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give 20 days' written notice of the levy to the record owner(s) of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The 20-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner of the land, the year or years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The finance director shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered.
d.
When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the finance director in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; provided, however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi. fa. shall be given at least ten days' written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery as follows:
1.
In cases of executions issued by a municipal officer for ad valorem taxes, to the property owner's last known address as listed in the records of the municipal officer of the municipality that issued the tax execution; or
2.
In cases of executions issued by a county officer for ad valorem taxes, the property owner's last known address as listed in the records of the tax commission of the county that issued the tax execution.
e.
A copy of the notice provided for herein shall also be sent by the same tax officer sending the notice to the property owner to the appropriate tax official of the state, county or municipality which also has issued an execution with respect to such property. In addition, if the United States has a claim or lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than 30 days before the proposed sale, the finance director shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the secretary of the treasury or his or her delegate not less than 25 days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.
f.
In all cases of levying on real property, within five days' written notice of the levy must be given personally, or delivered by certified mail, to the defendant in fi. fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the finance director shall enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi. fa. therein.
The finance director shall publish weekly for four weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the property owner(s) of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for collection of taxes due to the city and the year(s) for which taxes have been executed.
g.
Sales of property under execution shall be made by the finance director at the city council chambers on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time or eastern daylight savings time, which is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; provided, however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day, Independence Day or other city designated holiday, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the finance director conducting the sale, nor the city, make any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied.
h.
The finance director shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the finance director to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the finance director either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this Code section shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy or sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The finance director shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provided, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired.
i.
Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property sold for taxes after the property has been offered a reasonable time, the finance director may either re-advertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The finance director shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids.
(6)
Bidding by city at tax sales; disposition of property acquired.
a.
If, during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the finance director's cost due on the sale, then the city manager, or his or her designee, may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the finance director shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The finance director shall put the city in possession of the property so sold.
b.
Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder, however, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided herein.
c.
The right of redemption in real property purchased by the city at a tax sale shall be foreclosed in the manner set forth herein.
(7)
Accounting by finance director; final return or settlement.
a.
The finance director shall make a prompt accounting for all executions placed in his or her hands for collection or levy and sale. He or she shall pay all amounts due to the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties, and costs, and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs, and all expenses of a sale, the finance director shall retain the balance of the funds in his hands until he or she is ordered by the court first acquiring jurisdiction under proper proceedings to pay out the funds, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5, as may be amended from time to time.
b.
It shall be the duty of the finance director to cause cancellation of executions on the general execution docket of the county upon their final payment or collection.
(8)
Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgment.
a.
Whenever the finance director can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi. fa. on which to levy any tax execution in his or her hands, he or she shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The finance director, in the name of the city, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he or she believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi. fa. or who has property, money, or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi. fa. The finance director shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued.
b.
When an execution for taxes remains unsatisfied and an entry of "nulla bona" has been duly entered by the finance director on the execution within the immediately preceding 30-day period and the finance director has reason to believe the defendant in fi. fa. may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state, the finance director, in the name of the city, may petition the superior court of the county in this state in which the defendant in fi. fa. maintains a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi. fa. does not maintain a known residence in this state, the action may be brought in the county where the tax obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with O.C.G.A. ch. 3 of tit. 48, as may be amended from time to time.
(9)
Redemption rights of defendant in fi. fa.; vesting of title in grantee.
a.
Whenever real property is sold for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A. § 48-4-42, as may be amended from time to time, at any time within 12 months from the date of sale, and at any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-4-45, as may be amended from time to time, which code sections by reference are incorporated herein as a part of the code.
b.
Where notice of foreclosure of the right to redeem real property sold at a tax sale has not been given as required in subsection (1) of this section, title shall ripen by prescription after a period of four years from the date of recording of the deed in the county where the property is situated, provided the defendant in fi. fa. was not laboring under any legal disability at the time of sale. Unless the tax deed indicates a lesser interest was levied upon and sold, a fee simple title to the property shall vest absolutely in the grantee in the deed or in the grantee's heirs or assigns. In the event the defendant in fi. fa. is laboring under any legal disability, the prescriptive term shall begin from the time the disabilities are removed or abated.
(10)
Costs.
a.
For issuing executions, the city shall receive an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the clerk of superior court for recording and cancellations of the tax fi. fa.
b.
Once a levy is made or posted on the property of a defendant in fi. fa., the finance director shall collect all costs, including but not limited to all taxes, interest, penalties, postage, advertising fees, posting fees, attorney fees, title search fees, tax deed preparation, collection fees and all other costs heretofore accrued.
c.
The costs provided in this section shall be cumulative and in addition to any statutory premiums allowed as a part of the redemption price.
