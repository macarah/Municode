(b)
System requirements. In structures described in subsection (a) of this section, a combination fire protection sprinkler system shall be allowed. A combination fire protection system, for purposes of this section, means that the sprinkler system and the domestic water system utilize the same (common) service water supply pipe to the premises. Such system shall comply with the following:
(1)
Any calculations of pipe size shall be based on a 24-hour chart and must be approved by the authority having jurisdiction prior to permitting the sprinkler system.
(2)
No antifreeze solution or any other additive shall be allowed in any combination sprinkler system.
(3)
When a dead-end system is used, the sprinkler system shall be isolated from the domestic water system by not less than a dual checkvalve backflow preventer that conforms to ASSE standard 1024, and provides the flow requirements of the system without exceeding the allowable pressure drop of the standard or the system, whichever is less. A union and full-port shutoff valve, acceptable to the city, shall be installed on both sides of the backflow preventer to facilitate removal for test and repair. If sprinkler system pressure exceeds 120 psi a pressure reducing valve must be used.
Exception: In low pressure areas only, where residual pressure or flow gallons per minute do not meet minimum requirements, one head must flow minimum 18 gallons per minute with a 41 psi residual, and two heads must flow minimum 30 gallons per minute with a 30 psi residual, unless otherwise U.L. listed "A" circulating system may be used.

Branch lines shall not exceed 25 feet on any circulating system. The backflow preventer requirement is waived on such systems.
(4)
When the dual check and shutoff valves are installed outside the building, they shall not be buried in earth, but shall be installed in such manner as meter boxes and protected from freezing, at a location acceptable to the city. The top of the protective housing shall extend one-half inch above the finished landscaping.
(5)
All shutoffs in the sprinkler system shall be secured with lock and key in the open position. A sign on valves should read "Fire department should be notified when valves are turned off and when turned back on." All shutoffs shall be readily accessible at all times.

All mechanical rooms (furnace, water heater) shall have 135 to 165 degree commercial head with maximum three-eighths-inch orifice.
(12)
Dropped escutcheons shall be used if sprinkler head is obstructed by light fixtures or beams. The builder may use additional heads for areas where obstructions block the spray pattern.
(13)
When ceiling fans are used, sprinkler heads shall be located so fan escutcheon does not interfere with the pattern. Relocation of head shall still conform to spacing requirements. If sprinkler head location exceeds spacing requirements, additional heads shall be used.
(14)
All spacing of sprinkler heads, in relation to obstruction, such as fireplaces and heaters, shall be to sprinkler head manufacturers' requirements.
(15)
A minimum three-fourths-inch flow water meter is required if individual water meters are used.
(16)
