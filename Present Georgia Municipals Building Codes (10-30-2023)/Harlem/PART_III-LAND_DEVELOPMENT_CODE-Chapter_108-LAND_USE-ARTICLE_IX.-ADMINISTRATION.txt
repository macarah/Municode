(Code 2004, § 152.217; Ord. No. 381, 4-10-2006)
Sec. 108-353. - Relevant factors in rezoning evaluation.
In the city, the following factors are considered when applying the balancing test which is required to arrive at a rezoning decision. Those factors are as follows:
(1)
Existing uses and zoning of nearby property. Would the requested zoning permit land uses of a similar nature to those uses of similarly situated nearby land?
(2)
Extent to which property value is diminished by present zoning. How much more would the property be worth if the rezoning request were approved?
(3)
Extent to which destruction of the property value of the petitioner promotes the health, safety, morality, or general public welfare. How would approval of the request adversely impact the public interest? There may be many valid considerations here depending upon the nature of the request. Among them are:
a.
Traffic. Potential increase in congestion resulting from approval of the request;
b.
Diminution of value. Immediate diminution of gradual diminution resulting from deterioration of a neighborhood over a period of time;
c.
Environmental impact. Potential for generation of noise, air pollution, or deterioration of unique or sensitive environmental conditions.
(4)
Zoning of the property when purchased. Is the request a result of speculative purchase of the property?
(5)
The suitability of the subject property for the current zoning. Are natural environmental features conducive to the type of development permitted by the present zoning? Are the utilities present for development of the site? Would the topography or other natural environmental characteristics of the site be conducive to development under the present zoning?
(6)
Length of time the property has been vacant as zoned. Considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property.
(7)
Conformity. The extent to which rezoning request conforms with the city comprehensive plan.
(8)
Districts. The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts.
(9)
Public effects. The population density pattern and possible increase or overtaxing of the loan on public facilities including, but not limited to, schools, utilities, and streets.
(10)
Boundaries. Whether existing district boundaries are illogically drawn in relation to existing conditions on the property proposed for change.
(11)
Changing conditions. Whether changed or changing conditions make the passage of the proposed amendment necessary.
(12)
Drainage. Whether the proposed change will create a drainage problem.
(13)
Effects. Whether the proposed change will seriously reduce light and air to adjacent areas.
(14)
Property values. Whether the proposed change will adversely affect property values in the adjacent area.
(15)
Adjacent property. Whether the proposed change will be a deterrent to the improvement or development of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations.
(16)
Privilege. Whether the proposed change will constitute a grant of special privilege to an individual owner as contrasted with the public welfare.
(17)
Need for change. Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing zoning.
(18)
Neighborhood. Whether the change suggested is out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood or would adversely affect living conditions in the neighborhood.
(19)
State waters. Have state waters been documented as being on the site? Have state waters been designated by the community development director for the purpose of facilitating stormwater and erosion control? Would the topography or other natural environmental characteristics of the site be a possible factor in future storm water and erosion control? The United States Department of Agriculture Web Soil Survey or equivalent shall be utilized in conducting this analysis.
(20)
Land clearing analysis. Would the project result in wholesale removal of trees, shrubbery, and other ground cover? Has a forestry management plan been developed for the property to include harvesting and replanting? Are land disturbance activities expected to take place during traditionally rainy periods of the year? Would existing soil types and topography require special land clearance actions? Have all buffers been proposed that would protect environmental features and also adjacent property owners from adverse impacts?
(21)
General. Any other factors relevant to balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of property.

Sec. 108-355. - Deadline for withdrawal of petition.
Any petitioner shall have the right to voluntarily withdraw a petition for change of zoning by 12:00 noon on the date preceding the hearing date without commission approval for resubmission.

(1)
There are unusual, exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the property that do not apply generally to other property in the same vicinity or use district, and such conditions are not the result of the owner or occupant's own actions. The conditions may include topography, unique natural conditions, surroundings of the subject property, or the size or peculiar shape of the lot.
(2)

(4)
The variance approved is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure.
(5)
The variance does not permit a use of land, building or structure which is not permitted by right in the land use intensity district in which the proposed development is located.
(6)
After review of any distance-based variance request of less than 15 percent of the established distance standard, the community development director shall be authorized to consider the above five standards and subsequently administratively approve the application.
