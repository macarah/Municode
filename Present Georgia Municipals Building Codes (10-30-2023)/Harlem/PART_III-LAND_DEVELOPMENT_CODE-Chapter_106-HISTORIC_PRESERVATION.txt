The conditions such as broken windows, doors and openings which allow the elements and vermin to enter, and/or the deterioration of a building's structural system shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair.
(2)
In the event the commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the commission will notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of the property will have 30 days in which to do this.

In the event that the condition is not remedied in 30 days, the owner shall be subject to the penalties as provided in this article and, at the direction of the city council, the commission may perform the maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect.
