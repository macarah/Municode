Sec. 108-4. - Mandatory housing ratios.
For a city to be economically sound it must have diverse housing for residents and provide different forms of ownership such as fee simple and rentals. The city therefore has investigated the principles of urban planning and studied historical trends in the city and determined that the distribution of housing shall not exceed the following: multifamily-attached and single-family build-to-rentโ15 percent. This shall be calculated based on the number of total dwellings. At no time shall the number of multifamily-attached and single-family build-to-rent units exceed 15 percent of the total number of dwelling units. To maintain the prescribed ration, multifamily-attached and single-family build-to-rent units can only be increased on a per dwelling basis with the construction of new single-family detached homes. However, all property zoned B-1 downtown commercial or identified in the city center plan as downtown center is exempted from the ration limitation on multifamily-attached and single-family build-to-rent units. These provisions are intended to preserve the uniqueness of the city and to implement city comprehensive plan initiatives to plan for development. These provisions shall not apply to any property zoned for multifamily units prior to the date of ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
