ARTICLE VI. - HOME BUSINESS USES

Sec. 108-201. - Purpose and intent.
This article is intended to protect residential neighborhoods, with detached single-family residences on lots containing approximately one acre or less, from use of dwellings for business uses that would detract from the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. It is also intended to allow the use of detached dwellings for limited home business uses, subject to standards that will prevent nuisances and maintain the residential character of the neighborhood.
