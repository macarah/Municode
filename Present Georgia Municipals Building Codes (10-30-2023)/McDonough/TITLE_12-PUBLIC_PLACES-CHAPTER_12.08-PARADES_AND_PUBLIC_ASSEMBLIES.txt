Editor's note— Ord. No. 13-07-15 , § 1, adopted July 15, 2013, repealed the former Ch. 12.08, § 12.08.010, and enacted a new Ch. 12.08 as set out herein.

Sections:
PART 1. - IN GENERAL

12.08.010 - Purpose and intent.
The City of McDonough recognizes and supports the public's right of assembly and free speech and to utilize designated public facilities for such purposes. At the same time, the City has an important and compelling governmental interest in protecting property, public safety, health, and welfare, and controlling use of streets and other public facilities and venues. This chapter seeks to accommodate public rights of speech and assembly consistent with that governmental interest by establishing procedures, terms, and conditions for use of public areas and facilities for such purposes. A second purpose of this chapter is to facilitate and manage the manner in which public facilities that are not otherwise required for governmental operations may be made available for use on a temporary basis for non-governmental operations.
( Ord. No. 13-07-15 , § 1, 7-15-2013)
12.08.020 - Scope; authority.
This chapter applies to all public parades and assemblies that may be expected to affect the public, the property or services of the City, or otherwise require an expenditure of time and expense or create the potential for liability or public disturbance or other substantial concern. This chapter also applies to requests for use of public facilities for purposes other than governmental operations. This chapter is adopted in accordance with the authority vested in the City by its Charter, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs II and III of the Georgia Constitution, O.C.G.A. § 36-35-3 and all other applicable state and federal law.
( Ord. No. 13-07-15 , § 1, 7-15-2013)

Permit exceptions. Permits and prior approvals under this Chapter are not required for:

Spontaneous events involving a parade or public assembly occasioned by news or affairs coming into public knowledge within seven (7) days prior to such public assembly, provided that:

( Ord. No. 13-07-15 , § 1, 7-15-2013)
12.08.060 - General standards and procedures.
A.
Decision-making unrelated to content of expression. To achieve the purposes of this chapter without undue interference with protected rights of speech and assembly, decisions to issue, deny, or conditionally approve permits shall not be based on the content of a message associated with the event absent a compelling governmental interest. Notwithstanding that general standard, protections otherwise applicable to speech and assembly are limited and may not extend to speech or assembly that is intended to or has the result of causing public alarm, disruption, falsehood, or other form of expression that is not protected under the laws or constitution of this state or the United States.
B.
Time, place and manner controls. This chapter seeks to impose reasonable time, place and manner controls in an appropriate and limited manner upon events and facility uses for which permits are required. This chapter shall be administered in a manner that seeks to allow for expression, assembly, and the exercise of religious rights in accordance with applicable constitutional and statutory limits and controls.
C.
Internal appeal step. At any point in the permit application and approval process, an applicant who feels aggrieved or substantially and adversely affected by compliance with the chapter or permit process may request review through an intermediate appeal procedure under section 12.08.160.
D.
General application time frame. Except for permits involving streets, facilities, or venues, or types of events identified for either expedited processing or requiring longer-term processing as identified in section 12.08.080 or elsewhere in this chapter, applications for permits shall be filed not less than 7 days, nor more than 90 days, before the event for which the permit is sought.
E.
Requirements for insurance, bonding or other security. To avoid interference with protected rights of speech and assembly, any requirement imposed for surety for performance (including but not limited to insurance, bonding, or monetary deposits) shall be based upon needs directly associated with the event and not on the basis of possible disruption of the event by protestors or other persons who might be opposed to the speech or assembly.
( Ord. No. 13-07-15 , § 1, 7-15-2013)
12.08.070 - Standard application process.
A.
The process set forth in this section includes the standard procedure and requirements that apply to all applications for permits under this chapter. Additional requirements and exceptions or waivers for specific types of permits are set forth in parts 2 and 3 of this chapter.
B.
The Administrator shall create and provide application forms for each type of permit required by this chapter. The information required by the application shall be the minimum information that is required of any applicant. The application form shall include information designed to allow the City to act on the application in an informed manner to determine if the application meets the requirements of this chapter, including potential adverse effects as stated herein, and to allow the City to determine what requirements, if any, should be imposed as a condition of issuance of the permit. The Administrator may amend any application form in whole or in part on such notice as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances, provided that an amendment shall not apply to an application made prior to the Administrator's formal notice of any proposed amendment to the application form.
C.
Without limiting the authority of the Administrator to require reasonable additional information in connection with any specific application, such forms shall require the applicant to identify:
1.
The name, address, and telephone number of the person or the agent or representative of an organization or entity seeking to obtain the permit.
2.
The names, addresses and telephone numbers of the headquarters or business location of the organization seeking the permit or organizing or sponsoring the event or activity, if any, and the authorized and responsible heads of the organization.
3.
If the application is filed by any person other than an individual applying on the individual's own behalf, the application shall include written authorization from that other person or from a responsible, legally authorized representative of an organizational applicant authorizing the applicant to apply for the permit on its behalf.
4.
The requested date, time, and location for the event or activity. Specifically:
a.
The location description shall identify the extent of the public and private areas that will be involved in the activity or event.
b.
The time shall include the time during which the event or activity will be conducted and the time(s) during which preparation, set-up, assembly, clean-up or other actions may occur.
5.
The approximate number of persons who are anticipated to attend or participate in the activity or event, including a separate list of the number of any anticipated spectators, protestors, or counter-demonstrators, as appropriate.
6.
A description of the activity or event, including a description of specific activities planned during the event.
7.
A description of any recording equipment, sound amplification equipment, banners, signs, or other attention-getting signs or devices to be used in connection with the event.
8.
A description of any additional public facilities or equipment to be utilized in connection with the event.
D.
Any person seeking a permit shall file a completed application with the Administrator within the time frame required by this chapter or as stated on the application form, whichever time provides greater opportunity for review of the application by the City. The application shall be signed by the applicant or the applicant's duly authorized representative or agent under oath or affirmation.
( Ord. No. 13-07-15 , § 1, 7-15-2013)
12.08.080 - Expedited or extended application review.
A.
Expedited review. Upon request of an applicant, the Administrator may agree to an expedited application review when the applicant demonstrates that compliance with the standard review process (1) is not required due to size, location, duration or other appropriate factors indicating that public safety, welfare, and convenience would not be affected by expedited review or (2) would substantially burden protected rights, including speech and assembly, as to matters of public concern and the expedited review process would allow reasonable review to address substantial matters of public safety, welfare, and convenience.
B.
Extended review. Upon determining that the size, location, duration, or other appropriate factors that affect public safety, welfare, and convenience, require more intensive review of an application, the Administrator, after notice to the applicant, may extend the standard review period by a time not to exceed 48 hours.
( Ord. No. 13-07-15 , § 1, 7-15-2013)
12.08.090 - Fees.
A.
A non-refundable application-processing fee of $50.00 to cover administrative costs of processing the permit application shall be paid to the City by the applicant when the application is filed.
B.
Rental fees, service charges, or costs shall be payable according to the schedule set by the City, as may be amended from time to time by resolution of Mayor and Council, copies of which shall be kept on file in the office of the City Clerk, the Community Development Department, and such other departments as may be required by the Administrator.
( Ord. No. 13-07-15 , § 1, 7-15-2013)
12.08.100 - Police protection; public works and other expenses.
A.
Police protection.
1.
If possible, without disruption of ordinary police services or compromise of public safety and welfare, regularly scheduled on-duty police personnel shall cover the event. The Administrator shall seek review of any application which might require additional police personnel by the Police Chief.
2.
When reviewing an application, the Police Chief shall determine whether and to what extent additional police protection is reasonably necessary for the event for traffic control and public safety and welfare, including public convenience. The Police Chief shall base this decision on relevant criteria including, but not limited to, the size, location, duration, time and date of the event; the number of streets and intersections blocked; and the need to detour or preempt public travel and use of streets and sidewalks.
3.
The speech content of the event shall not be a factor in determining the amount of police protection necessary.
4.
If additional police protection for the event is deemed necessary by the Police Chief, he shall so inform the Administrator and applicant. The applicant shall be responsible for bearing the cost of any additional police protection deemed necessary. The Chief may, but is not required to, approve use of private security details in lieu of any or all special detail municipal police services that might otherwise be required under this section.
B.
Public works. In the same manner, the City shall determine if the applicant shall be required to pay for or provide additional public works-related actions such as lighting, refuse receptacles and pick-up, sanitary facilities, traffic control signs, devices, or personnel.
C.
Other expenses. In circumstances where the event itself may be expected to cause the City to incur additional, extraordinary expenses, the Administrator shall identify such expenses and the basis for determining them to be extraordinary. Such expenses may be imposed upon the applicant as a condition of approval of the permit.
D.
Expense exception. An applicant for an event conducted for the sole purpose of public issued speech protected under the First Amendment or the Georgia Constitution as determined by the Administrator shall not be required to pay for police protection or public works or other expenses for actions provided by the City. However, the applicant shall obtain a permit as required by this Chapter.
( Ord. No. 13-07-15 , § 1, 7-15-2013)
12.08.110 - Standards for actions on applications.
In addition to standards applicable to particular events or activities under other provisions of this chapter, a permit shall be issued when, from a consideration of the application and from such other information as may otherwise be obtained, the Administrator finds that:
A.
The application is complete and sets forth accurately and in sufficient detail the information required for consideration.
B.
Conduct of the event will not unduly inconvenience either the public in using public areas normally open for general public use or the City in the conduct of governmental operations.
C.
Adequate sanitation and other required health facilities are or will be made available in or adjacent to the area in which the event will be held.
D.
There are sufficient parking places near the site of the event to accommodate the number of vehicles reasonably expected.
E.
The applicant has secured police protection or otherwise arranged for event security, if any, required under section 12.08.100.
F.
The applicant has paid or provided for payment of any expenses or costs as may be required under section 12.08.100 or other provisions of this chapter.
G.
No event is scheduled elsewhere in the City where municipal resources (including but not limited to law enforcement, fire, or public works personnel) required for the events are so great that their deployment would have an immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and property.
H.
No permit may be issued that allows for the erection or placement of any structure, whether permanent or temporary, on a municipal street, sidewalk, or right-of-way unless advance approval for the erection or placement of the structure is obtained from the Mayor and Council.
( Ord. No. 13-07-15 , § 1, 7-15-2013)
12.08.120 - Non-discrimination.
The Administrator shall uniformly consider each application upon its merits and shall not discriminate in granting or denying permits under this chapter based upon political, religious, ethnic, race, disability, sexual orientation or gender-related grounds or other criteria that would constitute a violation of state or federal law.
( Ord. No. 13-07-15 , § 1, 7-15-2013)
12.08.130 - Recurring events; continuing permits.
Regularly held and scheduled events that would otherwise require issuance of a permit under this chapter may receive longer-term approvals, not to exceed three (3) years in duration, that will constitute permit approval under this chapter. Such longer-term approvals may be issued if the Administrator finds that:
A.
The events are to be held in an approved location; and
B.
The Police Chief, Fire Chief, Public Works Director each have reviewed the location and schedule for the proposed events and have notified the Administrator that they have no objection to the conduct of the events according to the schedule proposed.
C.
Any approvals under this section shall be subject to modification or termination upon a determination by the Administrator of changed conditions, circumstances or needs of the City. Any modification or termination of a continuing permit shall be subject to the appeal process in section 12.08.160, and shall not prevent the applicant from applying for a permit under the remaining provisions of this Chapter.
( Ord. No. 13-07-15 , § 1, 7-15-2013)
12.08.140 - Administrative action on application.
A.
Upon receiving an application, the Administrator shall determine within 48 hours if the application is complete or if any additional preliminary information is required and shall so inform the applicant. The applicant shall provide such required information prior to further consideration of the application. The requirement to supplement the application at this stage does not prevent the City from requiring additional information during its review and action upon the application.
B.
After accepting an application, the Administrator shall forward it for review and recommendation to the Police Chief and to any other municipal employee, official, or board deemed appropriate. Such review and recommendation shall occur within 5 days unless that period is extended by the Administrator.
C.
The Administrator also may refer the application for review by other governmental entities (e.g., county, regional, or state authorities) as deemed appropriate.
D.
After receiving comments and recommendations from such reviews and after considering such other information as deemed appropriate, the Administrator may require the applicant to submit additional information or respond to the reviews and recommendations or impose such conditions as are appropriate under the circumstances.

Upon completion of the foregoing, the Administrator shall act on the application. The Administrator may approve, amend, approve with conditions, or deny the application. For any action other than approval as submitted, the Administrator shall include a brief summary of the reasons for the decision.
F.
Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter or agreed to by the applicant, the Administrator shall act on an application within 7 days after determining that the application is complete in accordance with paragraph (A) of this section.

G.
The administrator may authorize the conduct of the event at a date, time, location, or route different from that proposed by the applicant. An applicant desiring to accept such an alternate permit shall so notify the Administrator in writing not less than 3 days after notice of the Administrator's action. An alternate permit shall conform to the requirements of, and shall have the effect of, a permit issued under this Chapter.
H.
A person aggrieved and directly affected by a decision of the Administrator under this section may file an interim or final administrative appeal pursuant to section 12.08.160.

The Administrator shall act upon a timely filed application for permit in accordance with section 12.08.140.

12.08.160 - Interim and final appeals.
An applicant or other person who is directly affected by a decision of the Administrator under this chapter may file an appeal of the decision as provided in this section.
A.
Interim appeal. Prior to a final decision by the Administrator, an applicant who claims that delay, imposition of conditions, or other action by the City violates any applicable law, or unreasonably and improperly interferes with constitutionally protected rights, may file an interim appeal as follows:
1.
The applicant shall notify the Administrator in writing of the claim specifying in detail the basis for the claim. The Administrator shall review the notice and determine if administrative action will adequately resolve the problem.
2.
If the applicant is not satisfied by such administrative action, the applicant may file a written appeal within 48 hours to the Mayor, with a copy to the City Clerk specifying the grounds for the appeal. The Mayor shall review the appeal to determine if he or she will hear the matter or if he or she determines that grounds for appeal are not properly set forth.
3.
If the Mayor determines that the appeal will not be heard, he or she shall notify the applicant within 24 hours of such decision. If the appeal proceeds, the Mayor shall schedule a hearing on the matter within 2 days with such notice to the applicant as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances. At the hearing, the Mayor shall hear the applicant, Administrator, and such other persons as may be allowed to speak. Within 48 hours after the hearing, the Mayor shall issue his or her decision in writing and shall so notify the applicant.
B.
Appeal of final action. The applicant or any person directly affected by final administrative action on an application may file a written appeal with the City Council, with a copy to the City Clerk not later than 3 days after the final action. The appeal shall state with specificity the grounds for the appeal. The City Council may deny an appeal without hearing if it determines on the face of the appeal that it has no merit and shall so notify the appellant and other directly affected parties within 48 hours after such determination. If the appeal proceeds, the City Council shall schedule a hearing within 14 days. The appeal hearing shall be limited to the grounds stated in the appeal unless the City Council for good cause determines to hear other issues or concerns. The appellant, applicant (if not the appellant), the Administrator and other persons directly affected may speak or submit evidence at the hearing. The City Council may determine who is permitted to participate in the hearing. The City Council shall issue its decision on the appeal, stating the reasons for its decision, within 5 days after the hearing.

The Administrator shall promptly review such request and, unless it is determined that cause for expedited review is not stated, shall grant expedited review within such time as may be reasonably required to meet the purposes of this chapter.

5.
Comments submitted by the officials and individuals listed in paragraph (A).

All costs to the City, direct and indirect, are reimbursed in full by the sponsor of the event.
