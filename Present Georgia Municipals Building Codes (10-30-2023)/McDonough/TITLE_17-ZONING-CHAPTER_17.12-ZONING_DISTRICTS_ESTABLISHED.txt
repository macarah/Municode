The boundaries of these districts are established as shown on the map entitled "Official Zoning Map, City of McDonough, Georgia," adopted by the City Council on November 5, 1979 and certified by the City clerk. The map is made a part of this Title 17 and all notations, references and other information thereon shall be as much a part of this Title 17 as if all the matter and information set forth by the map were fully described herein.
B.
If, in accordance with the provisions of this Title, changes are made in district boundaries or other subject matter portrayed on the map, such change shall be made on the official zoning map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the City Council.
C.
Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated or abandoned by official action of the Mayor and Council, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of same.
(Zoning Ord. § 510, 1979)
17.12.030 - Rules governing boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on the map, the following rules shall apply:
A.
Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets, alleys or highways, street lines, or highway right-of-way lines, land lot lines, militia district lines, lot lines or corporate limit lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries as they existed at the time of the passage of this regulation.
B.
In subdivided property or tracts, where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundaries, unless same are indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on such maps.
C.
Where boundaries are so indicated that they are measured from or are approximately parallel to the center lines of streets or to the center lines of alleys or the center lines of highways, such boundaries shall be construed as being measured from or being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the map.
D.
Where a district boundary line divides a lot in single ownership at the time of enactment of this Title 17, the district requirements for the least restricted portion of such lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof; provided that such extensions shall not include any part of such lot more than thirty-five (35) feet beyond the district boundary line.
(Zoning Ord. § 520, 1979)
