5.08.010 - Purpose.
Based on City officials' own observations of facilities that exploit human sexuality for commercial profit, euphemistically referred to as "adult entertainment" (hereinafter "Adult Entertainment"), and the experiences of other urban cities and counties including, but not limited to, College Park, Georgia; McDonough, Georgia; Atlanta, Georgia; Columbus, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Pinellas County, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Phoenix, Arizona, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the City of McDonough, Georgia, and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before the Mayor and Council, the Mayor and Council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within the country.
Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the mayor and city council for the City of McDonough, Georgia (hereinafter the "governing body"), and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Gwinnett County, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas, the governing body finds:
1.
Sexually oriented businesses, also known as adult entertainment establishments, lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or inadequately controlled by the operators of the establishments. The commercial exploitation of human sexuality, in all forms in which such exploitation may be manifested has a deleterious effect on the community where it takes place as heretofore mentioned. Sexually oriented businesses tend to cause an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas, including but not limited to disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials.
2.
We take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country and we base our observation both upon the experience of other urban and sub-urbancounties and municipalities, which we find relevant to the problems faced by the City.
3.
Certain employees of adult entertainment establishments as defined herein tend to engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
4.
Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live nude entertainment. Offering or providing such private or semi-private space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
5.
Adult entertainment establishments tend to escalate and exacerbate undesirable community conditions, including but not limited to blight, diminished property values, increased need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources, and increased burden on the judicial system as a result of the criminal behavior which the governing body finds such business establishments bring to a community. The secondary negative effects that are caused by such businesses are not limited to such facilities that offer live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts but other forms of sexually oriented businesses that also have a deleterious effect on nearby neighborhoods, commercial districts and on urban life in general. These other types of such businesses include but are not limited to adult bookstores, peep shows, massage parlors, bath houses, adult gift and novelty shops and lingerie or nude modeling studios.
6.
Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
7.
Communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses.
8.
AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components.
9.
According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
10.
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
11.
Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in some areas of some sexually oriented businesses.
12.
Allowing the clustering of Adult Entertainment Businesses, or allowing such businesses to have direct exposure to principle thoroughfares has a tendency to depress the surrounding business atmosphere of non-adult oriented businesses.
13.
Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
14.
Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult entertainment establishments as defined herein.
15.
Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.
16.
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and other secondary negative effects as described herein.
17.
It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding employees who may engage in the conduct which this Chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
18.
The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this Chapter.
19.
The barring of such individuals from the management of adult entertainment establishments for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
20.
Interstate exposure of Adult Entertainment Businesses can have a tendency to depress the surrounding business atmosphere of non-adult oriented businesses.
21.
Location of Adult Entertainment Businesses in the near vicinity of hotels and motels can have a tendency to depress the surrounding business atmosphere and contribute to crimes related to adult oriented businesses, including prostitution, pandering, solicitation and drug use.
22.
Public nudity, particularly when related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, tends to beget criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions such as depressed property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and an acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. The limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with sexually explicit establishments.
23.
The findings noted in paragraphs number (1) through (22) raise substantial governmental concerns.
24.
The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the City will be promoted by the enactment of this Chapter.
Moreover, it is the finding of the Mayor and Council that the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, in all the forms in which such exploitation may be manifested, collectively referred to hereafter as "Adult Entertainment," has a deleterious effect on the community where it takes place and that such effects are intensified and exacerbated when Adult Entertainment is provided in conjunction with the service or consumption of alcohol. The Mayor and Council find that Adult Entertainment causes an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas, including, but not limited to, disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. The Mayor and Council further find that Adult Entertainment facilities escalate undesirable community conditions, including blight, diminish property values, increase the need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources, and increase the burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described.
The Mayor and Council expressly find that the negative effects of Adult Entertainment are not limited to Adult Entertainment that offers live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts. Other forms of Adult Entertainment also have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in nearby neighborhoods and commercial districts and on urban life in general. Such other forms of Adult Entertainment include, but are not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters, massage parlors, bath houses, adult gift or novelty shops, and lingerie modeling studios.
Further, based on the investigation conducted by the City of McDonough regarding lingerie modeling studios, it is the finding of the Mayor and Council that lingerie modeling studios are facilities that offer Adult Entertainment in the form of live human nudity in a private setting. Based on the evidence presented to the Mayor and Council, it is apparent that lingerie modeling studios, by providing Adult Entertainment in a private setting, lead to criminal behavior including, but not limited to, masturbation for hire, prostitution, and sodomy.
Furthermore, based on the investigation conducted by the City, it is apparent that lingerie modeling studios pose a more difficult challenge to the enforcement of regulations pertaining to Adult Entertainment Business, in that the activity occurs within a private setting, as opposed to in an open area which is visible to all Patrons of the facility. For the same reason, the Mayor and Council have identified massage parlors as presenting similar risks of criminal behavior and problems of enforcement. The Mayor and Council have determined that lighting, visibility and access are measures that can reduce the risk of crime to Patrons and others.
Accordingly, the Mayor and Council find that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to limit and regulate Adult Entertainment within the corporate boundaries of the City, so as to limit the adverse impact on property values, other business uses, residential uses and public and semi-public uses; to ensure that Adult Entertainment uses and Adult Entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; to restrict Adult Entertainment and adult uses in heavily-used public pedestrian areas and to protect Patrons of Adult Entertainment Business from unreasonable risk of crime.
This Chapter is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally-protected forms of expression. This Chapter is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of Adult Entertainment facilities versus any legally protected rights of providers and Patrons of Adult Entertainment.
It is a matter of governmental interest and concern and in the interest of the public welfare to minimize the proliferation of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with facilities that commercially exploit human sexuality through Adult Entertainment to limit Adult Entertainment uses of property to certain prescribed areas of the City. To that end, this Chapter is adopted as set forth herein.

If a completed application is filed within the thirty-day period, then the existing license shall remain in effect for an additional period of up to thirty (30) days following the date of filing in order to allow the City Administrator to grant or deny the application under this Chapter. If the City Administrator grants the application, or if the application is deemed granted because of a failure to approve or deny the same within the thirty-day period provided for in this Chapter, then the beneficiary applicant(s) shall become the new owner(s) of the interest or license, which shall be considered transferred without any interruption of ownership interest and without any loss of vested rights, if any, which may have existed from the original approval of same, said interest or license being thereafter subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Chapter. If the beneficiary fails to file a completed application under this subsection within the thirty-day period, or if the application is denied (and if appealed, the denial is upheld on appeal), then the ownership interest or license shall terminate at midnight on the thirtieth day or at midnight on the day that a final judgment upholding the appeal is entered, and the adult entertainment establishment shall close its business on that day; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to allow or permit any license to remain in force and effect beyond midnight on December 31 of the year in which the death occurs, unless necessary to allow for one (1) or both of the two (2) thirty-day periods provided for in this subsection. If an appeal of a denial might remain pending on December 31 of the year in which it is filed, then in such an event, the beneficiary applicant shall file a new application for a license or approval of an ownership interest for the next succeeding calendar year under the terms of this Chapter.
D.
All other changes in an ownership interest in an adult entertainment establishment or a license issued under this Chapter must be reported in writing to the City's chief of police or his designee prior to such transfer, and the person who is intended to receive such ownership interest shall be required to make an application for a license as if he or she were applying for a new license hereunder. No licensee may change the location of the licensee's operation; any change in location shall require application for a new license under this Chapter, so that such application process is completed before the relocation takes place.
E.
