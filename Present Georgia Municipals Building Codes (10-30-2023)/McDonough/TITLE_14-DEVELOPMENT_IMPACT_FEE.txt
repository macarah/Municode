Are reasonably expected to be generated by new development; and

Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which an impact fee is imposed.

The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee.
2.
In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule (Attachment A hereto).
3.
If a land use designation is not in a category contained in this title, then an appropriate new category may be added by the administrator and an appropriate fee established under the city's current impact fee methodology, subject to annual confirmation by the mayor and council.

E.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit.
( Ord. No. 21-08-03, § 1, 8-3-2021)
