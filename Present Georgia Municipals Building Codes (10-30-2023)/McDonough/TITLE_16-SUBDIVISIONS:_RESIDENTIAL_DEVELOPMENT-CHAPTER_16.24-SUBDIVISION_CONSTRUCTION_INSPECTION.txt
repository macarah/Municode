CHAPTER 16.24 - SUBDIVISION CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION

Sections:
16.24.010 - Preconstruction review and approval.
A.
All subdivisions and planned unit development (PUD) projects shall construct and install all improvements in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 16.16. The steps for preconstruction review and approval and required inspections shall be followed as indicated below.
B.
Prior to beginning development of the subdivision the developer shall first obtain the following approvals:
1.
Preliminary plat approval required. The developer must first have a preliminary subdivision plat approved by the city.
2.
Soil erosion and sedimentation control plan. The developer must have a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan in compliance with the McDonough Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance. The plan shall be reviewed and coordinated by the community development department. No grading permit shall be issued by the community development department for any development which does not have an approved soil erosion and sedimentation control plan.
3.
Preconstruction conference. Prior to grading, the developer shall contact the community development department to arrange a preconstruction conference. The preconstruction meeting shall include a review of the soil erosion and sedimentation control plan, street cross sections and profiles, construction specifications, procedures for inspections and testing, stormwater drainage and detention facilities, water/sewer service, and any other matters concerning the development. The developer shall provide a list of names, telephone numbers, addresses, and business license numbers of all contractors and subcontractors employed on a job.
4.
Grading permit required. A grading permit may be issued by the community development department only after the approval of the site plans and soil erosion and sedimentation control plan. Site grading shall be limited only to those areas clearly defined on the approved plans. Any site grading which is done without an approved soil erosion control plan and development permit is a violation of this chapter and shall result in enforcement penalties as provided by Chapter 16.32. In instances where grading has occurred prior to issuance of a development permit, or when grading has exceeded the area approved according to the approved plans and grading permit, the permit fee amount shall be doubled. Any violations of the conditions or limitations imposed by the development permit shall also be subject to penalties provided by Chapter 16.32.

16.24.020 - Inspection procedures.
The developer is responsible for making requests for inspections before beginning any of the stages indicated below. No grading shall commence without an approval of the soil erosion and sedimentation control plan, the installation of the soil erosion prevention measures in accordance with the plan, and a grading permit.
1.
Inspection notification. The developer shall notify the community development department at least 24 hours before any stage of construction begins. If construction during any phase is stopped or delayed due to inclement weather or other reasons, the developer shall notify the community development department 24 hours before commencing construction activity again.
2.
Grading. After providing the required notice to the community development department, clearing of the right-of-way may begin. All work is to be in accordance with section 16.16.240 of this chapter.
3.
Street grading. Following inspection and approval of the street clearing by the community development department, and street grade stakes have been set by the project's engineer, the contractor may proceed with the final grading of the streets. All work is to be in accordance with section 16.16.240. Compaction tests shall be made as required by the utilities inspector to determine that the required 95 percent maximum dry density is being achieved. At least one test shall be made over each storm drain pipe when it has been covered with 18 inches of back fill material.
4.
Subgrade compaction. Following the completion and approval of the street grading and installation of curb and gutter the contractor may proceed with the preparation of the subgrade in accordance with section 16.16.240. Compaction tests shall be made at the direction of the utilities inspector to determine that the required 100 percent maximum dry density is being achieved.
5.
Curb and gutter. Following the installation of all proposed sanitary sewer and water lines and acceptance of the street grading the contractor may proceed with the construction of the curb and gutter. All work and materials shall be in accordance with section 16.16.240.
6.
Base preparation. After the street subgrade has been inspected and approved, the contractor may proceed with the construction of the street pavement base. All work and materials shall be in accordance with section 16.16.240 and Table 16.1. Compaction tests shall be made as directed by the city to assure that the required 100 percent maximum dry density has been achieved. Cores shall be taken as directed by the city to determine the constructed thickness of the base course.
7.
Paving. After the road base has been approved and accepted by the development inspector, the contractor may proceed with the construction of the asphaltic concrete binder and/or surface courses. All work and materials shall be in accordance with section 16.16.240 and Tables 16.1 and 16.2 of this title. Compaction tests shall be made as directed by the city to assure that the required 98 percent maximum has been achieved.
8.
Street core tests. Street core test results shall be submitted and approved by utilities inspector prior to the recording of a final subdivision plat. These cores shall be taken as directed by the utilities inspector immediately upon completion of the surface course. Refer to section 16.16.240.
9.
Soil erosion and sedimentation control. During all of the stages of inspection, soil erosion, and sedimentation control measures shall be inspected. The subdivision shall be subject to soil erosion and sedimentation control inspection at any other times determined necessary to assure compliance with the approved plan. The developer is responsible for continued maintenance of all soil erosion and sedimentation control measures as required by the McDonough Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance.
10.
Work stoppage. A stop-work order may be issued at anytime if it is determined to be necessary due to failure of the developer to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter, the zoning ordinance or, the soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance. A stop-work notice shall be posted on the site and the developer shall be notified in writing concerning the reasons for the stop-work order. Any work which proceeds in violation of a stop order shall subject the developer to penalties as prescribed in Chapter 16.3 of this title.
11.
Work delays. If construction during any phase of development is delayed due to inclement weather or for other reasons, the developer shall notify the community development department prior to resuming construction activity.
