A copy of the contract between the commercial entity and the independent commercial garbage service shall be provided to the city.

D.
This section expressly authorizes the city, through its agents and employees, to subcontract with any commercial garbage hauler to provide a commercial garbage pick-up service to the commercial entities located within the city limits. The contract so entered into by the city may provide for the placement of roll-carts and/or dumpsters within the city limits and a pick up schedule for the roll-carts and/or dumpsters. A copy of such contract can be found in the office of the city clerk, and each and every provision of the contract is incorporated in this chapter by reference and made a part hereof.

Owner to maintain premises free of litter. The owner or person in control of any private property shall at all times maintain the premises free of litter; provided however, that this section shall not prohibit the storage of litter in authorized private receptacles for collection.
(b)
Clearing of private property by city.
(1)
The city through its officers, is authorized and empowered to notify the owner of any private property within the city, or the agent of such owner, to properly dispose of litter located on such property, or to order the clearing of obnoxious vegetation, as provided in subsection (c), which is dangerous to public health, safety and welfare.
(2)
Upon the failure, neglect, or refusal of any owner or agent so notified, to properly dispose of litter dangerous to the public health, safety or welfare within the ten (10) days after receipt of written notice, or such notices return due to inability to make registered delivery, the city is hereby authorized and empowered to pay for disposing of such litter.

When the full amount due the city is not paid within thirty (30) days, there shall be recorded in the property records of the county courthouse, a sworn statement showing the cost and expense incurred for the work, the date the work was done, and the legal description of the property. The recordation of such sworn statement shall constitute a lien on the property and shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due in amount due in principal and interest, plus cost of court, reasonable attorney fees, for collection, until final payment has been made. Sworn statements recorded shall be prima facie evidence that all legal requirements have been complied with and that the work has been done properly and shall be in full notice to every person concerned that the amount of the statement, plus interests and costs, constitutes a charge against the property designated or described in the statement and that the same is due and collectible as provided by law.

Rubbish, obnoxious vegetation, junk vehicles, and machinery prohibited. It shall be unlawful for the owner, renter or lessee or the holder of an easement on real property within the city to allow such property to be a dumping place for rubbish of all kinds and descriptions, become overgrown with obnoxious vegetation, or become unsightly with junk vehicles and/or junk machinery, all of which is considered a nuisance and punishable.
(d)
[Enforcement.] If the owner or person in control of said private property has, within the previous six (6) months, been given notice of a violation of this section, the city officials and employees shall be authorized to immediately issue a citation for a subsequent violation without the requirement of additional notice or opportunity to cure.
