18.07.050 - Applicability.
This Chapter shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations.
(Ord. No. 10-09-20(A), § I, 9-20-2010)
18.07.060 - Grandfather Provisions.
This Chapter shall not apply to work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that was zoned and approved for such use on or before July 2006.
(Ord. No. 10-09-20(A), § I, 9-20-2010)
18.07.070 - Exemptions.
The following specific activities are exempt from this Chapter. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property.
1.
Activities for the purpose of building one of the following:
a.
A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line;
b.
Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures;
c.
Intrusions necessary to provide access to a property;
d.
Public access facilities that must be on the water including boat ramps, docks, foot trails leading directly to the river, fishing platforms and overlooks;
e.
Unpaved foot trails and paths;
f.
Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality and/or aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used.
2.
Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least twenty-five (25) feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including, but not limited to, manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited herein.
3.
Within an easement of any utility existing before July 2006 or approved under the terms of this Chapter, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures.
4.
Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the Community Development Director, City of McDonough, on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten (10) days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the Community Development Director, City of McDonough, to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area.
5.
Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer.
After July 2006, this Chapter shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities. Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any imperious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to [Section] 18.07.090 below.
(Ord. No. 10-09-20(A), § I, 9-20-2010)
18.07.080 - Buffer and Setback Requirements.
All land development activity subject to this Chapter shall meet the following requirements:
1.
An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for fifty (50) feet, measured horizontally, on both banks of the stream as measured from the point of wrested vegetation or the top of the stream bank, to be determined by the Community Development Director.
2.
An additional setback shall be maintained for twenty-five (25) feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
3.
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
(Ord. No. 10-09-20(A), § I, 9-20-2010)
18.07.090 - Variance Procedures.
Variances from the above setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
1.
No variance shall be granted to the buffer requirement by the City of McDonough.
2.
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this Chapter, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this Chapter, and the Community Development Director, City of McDonough, finds and determines that the requirements of this Chapter prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the Community Development Director, City of McDonough, may grant a variance from the setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
3.
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the original adoption of this Chapter prevents land development unless a setback variance is granted.
b.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the setback requirements in the Ordinance would create an extreme hardship.
4.
Variances shall not be considered when, following the original adoption of this Chapter, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
5.
At a minimum, a setback variance request shall include the following information:
a.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
b.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
c.
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the setback. The exact area of the setback to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the setback be maintained;
e.
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
f.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
g.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and,
h.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
6.
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
a.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
b.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
c.
The location and extent of the proposed setback intrusion;
d.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
e.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and
f.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.
