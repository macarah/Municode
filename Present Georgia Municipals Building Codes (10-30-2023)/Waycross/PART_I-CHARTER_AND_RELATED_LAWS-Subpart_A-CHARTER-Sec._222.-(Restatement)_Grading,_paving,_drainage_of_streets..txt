Whenever the mayor and the commission shall deem it proper in their discretion to grade, pave, drain, or otherwise improve for travel and drainage, any streets and alleys of said city, they shall have made a survey of such streets and alleys and plans, specifications and estimates of the cost of such grading, paving, drainage and other improvements, which plans and specifications shall establish and fix the grades of the streets to be improved and the size and location of all drains, sewers and water mains. They shall divide the streets and alleys on which such improvements are to be made into improvement districts, describing each of such districts by name, number and designating the streets and alleys and parts of streets and alleys to be included in each district. They shall have authority to require all sewer and water connections to be laid to the curbline or property line in front of improved or unimproved lots, before the improvements are made, and if such connections are not laid by the property owners, they may be laid by the city, and the cost thereof assessed against the lots as a part of the cost of the improvements.
