The city commission or other governing body of said city shall elect a city marshal, who shall serve for a term of two years and until his successor is elected and qualified. The compensation of the city marshal shall be fixed by the city commission. The office of city marshal shall not be abolished by the city commission, and shall not be combined with any other office. The city marshal shall be required to give bond in the sum of $10,000.00, in the same manner as the city clerk. He shall be charged with the duty of collecting all delinquent taxes due to the city that may be turned over to him by the city clerk and tax collector, and shall account to the city clerk and tax collector promptly for all monies collected by him. He shall be the special officer of the board of tax assessors, and shall work in conjunction with said board in searching out and seeing that all property, both real and personal, subject to taxation by the city, is properly returned or assessed for taxation, in accordance with the rules, laws, and ordinances of said city. He shall also see that all persons, firms, or corporations subject to specific, occupation or license taxes shall pay the same promptly when due, and upon failure of any person so to do, the city marshal is empowered to summons them to appear before the recorder's court of said city, there to be dealt with as provided by law. The provisions of the city Charter now in effect as to the collection of taxes, tax sales, transfer of executions, redemptions, and illegalities shall remain as they are now, unless otherwise provided for herein.
