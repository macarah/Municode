Sec. 1-2. - Definitions and rules of construction.
The following definitions and rules shall apply to all ordinances of the city commission, unless the context requires otherwise:
Generally. The ordinary signification shall be applied to all words, except words of art, or words connected with a particular trade or subject matter, when they shall have the signification attached to them by experts in such trade, or with reference to such subject matter. In all interpolations the courts shall look diligently for the intention of the city commission, keeping in view, at all times, the old law, the evil and the remedy. Grammatical errors shall not vitiate, and a transposition of words and clauses may be resorted to when the sentence or clause is without meaning as it stands. While subpart A of this part is a codification of general ordinances and subpart B is a codification of ordinances pertaining to land development, provisions in subpart A of this part may also apply to land development and provisions in subpart B of this part may also apply to activities other than land development. The failure to include in subpart B of this part provisions that relate to land development does not excuse noncompliance with such provisions. The inclusion in subpart B of this part of provisions that relate to activities other than land development does not excuse noncompliance with such provisions.
