In all cases where necessary for the protection of the public and the adjoining properties, streets/roads, and sidewalks, curbs as described above, shall be installed.
7.
Adequate means of ingress and egress shall be provided and shown on plan submitted. Minimum shall be 15 feet wide for one way and 24 feet wide for two-way traffic.
