ARTICLE X. - R-PUD, RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT

Section 10.01. - Residential planned unit development district.
It is the intention of this ordinance to provide areas of sufficient size and allowing reasonable flexibility in design and orientation for the establishment of a structure or group of structures which include multiple dwellings designed in a planned unit development of more than one building on a given site. The requirements of the area, height, bulk, and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings and individual lots of record, would in certain cases of large scale development have results affording less protection to the public health, safety and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of these planned unit developments as special and particular land use can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects on adjoining properties.
Therefore, the zoning ordinance regulations relative to area, height, bulk and placement may, in the residential planned unit development district, be modified by the planning commission and county commission in the case of a plan for a large scale development which, in the judgment of the planning commission and county commission, provides adequate open space and improvements for circulation, recreation, education, light air and service needs of the tract when fully developed, provided that in no case may the density of the proposed planned unit development exceed 13 dwelling units per acre and provided further that the minimum site size for the residential planned unit development is three acres.
Within the residential planned unit development district the following regulations shall apply.
(Ord. No. 2006-5, § 1, 10-24-06)
Section 10.02. - Permitted uses.

Section 10.03. - Preliminary review.
Preliminary review is required as an aid to both the developer and to the county. Under this procedure, a developer provides the information which is described below and the county zoning administrator then acts on the information provided. This review is intended to then serve as a guide for the immediate inspection of the planning commission, subject to a thorough study and analysis. Changes and additions which may have to be made before a mutual agreement is reached can be made at such time without excessive engineering costs to the developer.
(Ord. No. 2006-5, § 1, 10-24-06)
Section 10.04. - Procedure for preliminary approval.

Section 10.06. - Design standards.
The requirements of area, height, bulk, and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings in individual lots of record, would in certain cases of large-scale developments have results affording less protection in the public health, safety and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of these planned unit developments can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects to adjoining properties. Therefore, the regulations relative to area, height, bulk, and placement may be modified by the planning commission and county commission in the case of a planned unit development if, in the judgment of the planning commission and county commission, such development provides adequate open space and improvements for circulation, recreation, education, light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed, provided that in no case may the density of the proposed development exceed that of the R-3 district, and provided further that the minimum site size for the planned unit development is three acres.
