This article shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area as defined in section 109-302. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations.
After the effective date of this article, this article shall apply to new subdividing, land development, and platting activities.
(1)
Grandfather provisions. This article shall not apply to the following activities:
a.
Work consisting of the repair, maintenance or replacement within the same disturbed area of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of this article.
b.
Existing development and on-going land disturbance activities including but not limited to existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements.
c.
Any lawful land development activity that is under construction, has a valid permit, or has submitted a valid and complete application for a permit as of the effective date of this article provided that the permit is or can be issued within 90 calendar days of the effective date of this article and all time frames associated with said permit are observed.
d.
Any lawful land development activity that has not been submitted for approval, but that is part of a larger master development plan, such as a house in a subdivision or a building in an office park or other phased development that has a valid preliminary plat permit per subsection 109-303(1)c. herein, or approved concept plan, or has submitted a valid and complete application for approval of a concept plan and receives approval within 90 calendar days as of the effective date of this article provided that the future permit is or can be issued within two calendar years of the effective date of this article and all time frames associated with said permit are observed.

Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property.
(Ord. No. 2018-530, 12-10-2018)
Sec. 109-304. - Land development requirements.
(a)
Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
An undisturbed buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank or wrested vegetation. The land forming the bank is also considered part of the buffer for purposes of this article.
(2)
An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
(3)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to section 109-304(b) herein.
(b)
Variance procedures. Variance requests from the requirements of this article shall be submitted on an application form as prescribed by the director or the director's designee, along with such fees as shall be established by the city council. The director or the director's designee shall coordinate the review of each variance request with all other affected departments and shall forward such comments or recommendations as may be received to the zoning board of appeals (ZBA) for action in their normal course of business. The review must include a recommendation from the city.
This section describes how to apply for a variance from this article, however, any activity within the 25-foot state waters' buffer must meet state (GA EPD) requirements.
Variances may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Except as provided above, the city shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the zoning board of appeals. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within Gwinnett County at least once a week for two consecutive weeks before it is heard. The city shall post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing at least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
No application or reapplication for a variance affecting the same stream segment on a property shall be heard within 12 months from the date of last action by the city unless such 12-month period is waived by the city, and in no case may such application or reapplication be reconsidered in less than six months from the date of last action by the city.
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
The applicant provides evidence that impacts to the buffer have been avoided or minimized to the fullest extent practicable.
b.
The project involves the construction or repair of a structure that, by its nature, must be located within the buffer. Such structures include dams and detention/retention ponds.
c.
The proposed land disturbing activity within the buffer will receive a permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) under Section 404 of the federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendment of 1972, 33 U.S.C. Section 1344, and the Corps of Engineers has received a mitigation plan to be implemented as a condition of such a permit. In addition, land disturbing activities in the buffer that are outside the USACE's jurisdiction must be mitigated.
d.
The buffer intrusion will be mitigated in accordance with city's stream buffer restoration guidelines.
e.
A valid and complete application for rezoning of the property is submitted prior to the effective date of this article and approval of the rezoning by the board of commissioners occurs after the effective date of this article application, and the variance request is consistent with the intent of this article factoring into account the property owner's reliance on standards in effect at the time of the rezoning.
(2)
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
a.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
b.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
