Sec. 14-501. - Short-term rental permit required.

All persons/businesses shall, before beginning the business of operating a short-term rental, first file an application with the planning department for a short-term rental permit to conduct such business. The permit provides for an initial and annual life safety inspection of the short-term rental property and shall incur a fee per inspection, established by the city council to cover the cost of a life safety inspection and/or administrative costs associated with issuing the permit and authorizing an annual certificate of compliance. In the event an applicant has more than one short-term rental property, each location will be subject to inspection and assessment of the fee. This fee is nonrefundable in the event an applicant, for any reason, is not issued a certificate of compliance and/or occupational tax certificate. The city reserves the right to inspect short-term rentals after the life safety inspection on an as-needed basis to assess code compliance.
