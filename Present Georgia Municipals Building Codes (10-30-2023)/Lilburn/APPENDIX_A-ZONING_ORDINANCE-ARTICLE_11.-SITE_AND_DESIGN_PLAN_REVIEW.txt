Insure architectural compatibility between buildings and adequate landscaping to promote and protect the aesthetic and historic qualities of Lilburn.
4.
Minimize any adverse impacts of new development on existing uses through provision of screening, buffering, landscaping and other techniques.
5.
Preserve and enhance the natural resources of Lilburn in order to provide aesthetic and other public benefits, such as erosion sedimentation and pollution control, energy conservation, minimization of flood hazards, and resilient eco systems.
