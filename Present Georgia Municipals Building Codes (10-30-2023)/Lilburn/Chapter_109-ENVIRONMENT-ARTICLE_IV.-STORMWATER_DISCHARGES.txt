ARTICLE IV. - STORMWATER DISCHARGES

Sec. 109-116. - Findings; determination; separate storm sewer system.
(a)
The city separate storm sewer system was designed and installed to manage stormwater so as to prevent localized flooding, damage to property and risk to public safety.
(b)
The city separate storm sewer system was not designed or installed as a receiving system for nonstormwater discharges.
(c)
Discharges to the city separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters.
(d)
Nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments.
(e)
Nonstormwater discharges not only impact local waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters.
(f)
The impacts of nonstormwater discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters.
(g)
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the county separate storm sewer system.
(h)
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of nonpoint source pollution caused by nonstormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system.
(i)
The Clean Water Act requires the management and maintenance of the city separate storm sewer system and the management of discharges to that system.
(j)
In order to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system, it is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
