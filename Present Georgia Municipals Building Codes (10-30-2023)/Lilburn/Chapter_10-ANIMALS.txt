Sec. 10-56. - Exceptions.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, no dog shall be classified as a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog within the meaning of this article as a result of an injury upon a human being inflicted at a time when the dog was being used by a law enforcement officer to carry out the law enforcement officer's official duties.

(1)
The notice shall be in writing and mailed by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the owner's last know address.

At the hearing, the owner shall be given the opportunity to testify and to present evidence. The board shall also receive such other evidence and hear such other testimony as it may find reasonably necessary to make a determination either to sustain, modify or overrule the classification of the dog by the dog control officer. Within ten days of the date of the hearing, the board shall notify the owner in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery of its determination on the matter. If the determination is made that the dog is a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog, the notice shall specify the date upon which that determination is effective.
