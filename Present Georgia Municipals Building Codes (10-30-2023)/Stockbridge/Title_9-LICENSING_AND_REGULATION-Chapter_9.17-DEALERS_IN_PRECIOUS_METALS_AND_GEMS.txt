(Ord. No. 11-253, § 1, 6-13-2011)
9.17.030 - Limitation on issuance.
A.
Preliminary Findings.
1.
As a municipality located within the Atlanta Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area which is experiencing rapid growth and change due to urbanization of our county and being familiar with the experiences of other urban and suburban counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Atlanta, Dekalb County, and Fulton County, Georgia, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, the mayor and council take note of the well known and self-evident conditions attendant to the operation of businesses by dealer in precious metals or gems, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country.
2.
Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that operation of businesses by dealers in precious metals or gems under certain circumstances, leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions.
3.
Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the operation of businesses by dealers in precious metals or gems, are theft, burglary, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of minors. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with such businesses, are actual or perceived depression of property values or acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation in expenditures for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and an increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this section.
4.
Accordingly, it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of businesses operated by dealers in precious metals or gems by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of such businesses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semipublic uses; to ensure that businesses operated by dealers in precious metals or gems do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts.
5.
Therefore, the numerical limitation of businesses operated by dealers in precious metals or gems is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with such activities. To that end, the ordinance codified in this section is adopted.
B.
No precious metal or gems dealer's license shall be issued to any person or to any dealer in precious metals or gems who has been convicted of any crime involving as an element thereof the theft of property.
C.
The city shall issue a maximum of three (3) licenses to dealers in precious metals or gems. No additional licenses shall be issued unless the population of the City of Stockbridge reaches twenty thousand (20,000) residents, at which time one additional license may be permitted for each five thousand (5,000) residents of the city over the twenty thousand (20,000) initial threshold. No application for a license to do business as a dealer in precious metals and gems shall be considered or approved or a license issued where the total number of precious metals and gems dealer licenses issued and in effect at the time of such application numbers at least one (1) for each five thousand (5,000) residents according to the latest officially and finally published annual population estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau. In making this computation, fractions of each five thousand (5,000) residents shall not be considered. For purposes of this section, nonconforming precious metals and gems licenses shall be included for purposes of calculating the number of outstanding licenses.
D.
Whenever it shall be recognized by the city treasurer that the release of population projections by the U.S. Census Bureau results in the availability of one (1) or more additional licenses, and it is determined by the city treasurer that one (1) or more additional licenses are available, the city shall publish a notice, one time, advising the public of such, and that applications will be received for a period of forty-five (45) days subsequent to the publication. If, during this period, applications are received which exceed the number of newly available licenses, there shall be held a lottery, administered by the city treasurer, to determine the order in which applications shall be processed. Thereafter, the applications shall be processed in the order reflected in the results of the lottery. Once the proceeding of applications has resulted in the issuance of licenses up to the limit contained in this chapter, the remaining applications shall be returned to the applicants, unprocessed. If no applications are received during the forty-five-day period after publication, applications shall thereafter be processed in the order in which they may thereafter be received.
