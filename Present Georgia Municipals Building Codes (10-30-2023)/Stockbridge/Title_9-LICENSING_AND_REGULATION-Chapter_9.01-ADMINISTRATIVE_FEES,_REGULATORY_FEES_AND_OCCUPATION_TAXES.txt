However, for convenience of both city and the taxpayer, each business subject to the occupation tax shall, on or before the dates hereinafter set forth file with the city the return hereinafter specifically provided for, showing the gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year. This return shall be used as the basis for making estimated payments on the occupation tax for the current calendar year. The actual and final amount of tax levied for business transacted in the current calendar year shall be paid in accordance with a final return to be made after the end of the year, in accordance with the procedure set forth here.
B.
The person subject to said occupation tax of the current calendar year (or persons subject to occupation tax for the previous calendar year as set forth in subsection D below) shall receive a form furnished by the city, and shall return said form within thirty (30) days of receipt, a signed return setting forth the amount of gross receipts of such business for the entire preceding calendar year. This return will be used to determine the final tax for the calendar year just completed and as an estimate of the gross receipts and occupation tax for the current calendar year.
C.
Where a business subject to the occupation tax for the calendar year has been conducted for only a part of the preceding year, the amount of gross receipts for such part shall be reported in said return. Said return shall also show a figure putting the receipts for such part of a year on an annual basis with the part-year receipts bearing the same ratio to the whole-year gross receipts as the part year bears to the whole year. Said figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year in establishing the business tax liability.
D.
For those practitioners of professions who are lawyers or attorneys engaged in the practice of law, and who elect to pay the occupation tax as set forth in Section 9.01.030 as opposed to the method set forth in Section 9.01.090(A)(2), all occupation taxes levied under this article are levied on the amount of business which was transacted during the previous calendar year. Each person subject to the occupation tax levied in this chapter shall file with the occupation tax clerk the returns specifically provided for in this section, showing the gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year. This return shall be used as a basis for making payment of the occupation tax for the previous calendar year.

B.
If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this chapter, is less than the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said business based on the estimate filed by the business, the difference in said amount shall be due and payable by the taxpayer to the city on April 1st of the current year and delinquent if not paid on or before said date.
C.
If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this chapter, exceeds the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said business based on the statement filed by the business, the difference in said amount shall be refunded by city to the taxpayer; or if, said business continues to be conducted in city during the current year, such difference in amount may be credited by the city on the amount of occupation tax to be paid to the city by said business for the current year.
