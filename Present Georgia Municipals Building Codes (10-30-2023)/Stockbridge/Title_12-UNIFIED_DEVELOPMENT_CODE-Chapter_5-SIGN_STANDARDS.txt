Chapter 5 - SIGN STANDARDS

5.1 - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is set forth as follows herein:
A.
A comprehensive sign regulation is necessary because of the current burgeoning growth in Stockbridge and Henry County in general and because two (2) major interstate highways run through the city and attract numerous signs, leading to poor aesthetics and dropping property values.
B.
To prevent the further deterioration of the city and to ensure that it remains an attractive residential area as well as a viable commercial area, it is necessary to maintain a visually satisfying environment. A plethora of signs of a certain size and number, no matter how tasteful, can have an undesirable effect upon traffic safety and the well-being of the entire community. The city is more likely to attract commercial enterprises and permanent residents if it improves and maintains its appearance. City residents will ultimately benefit from enhanced retail and commercial environments and improvements in the quality of life as a result of these regulations. It is a rational desire of the community, and most specifically of those who live therein from day to day, to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness is minimized.
C.
Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and sustain stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and to encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings, and other structures throughout the city.
D.
Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents, and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city council hereby imposes the sign regulations contained in this article.
E.
The city council finds that there is a compelling State interest in the city and State being able to safely regulate the speed, direction and flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in and around public roads, streets and sidewalks, and quasi-public roads, streets and sidewalks in private property where the general public, invited by the owner, routinely and customarily to enters, transverses, and parks by vehicle and/or by foot. The city has a compelling State interest in the public safety and welfare of motorist and pedestrians in these areas, the safe and expedient access of public safety vehicles such as police, fire and rescue equipment to such areas. The city has a compelling State interest to regulate vehicular and pedestrian traffic such as to prevent or minimize collisions and the injury or death to persons caused thereby, or the damage to property, both public and private. Therefore, the city determines that there is a compelling State interest in the city's police chief regulating the type, traffic control message and placement of all traffic control signs and devices in the areas described above. The city also has a compelling State interest in insuring that private entities are not allowed to display in the areas described above, signs that imitate or emulate traffic instructional and control signs, devices or messages in such a way as may reasonably be mistaken by the public as true traffic control signs or devices, and thereby could reasonably be expected to cause a motorist or pedestrian to make an improper maneuver which will place the motorist or pedestrian or other motorist or pedestrian in danger of collision or injury due to such improper maneuver. Therefore, the city has a compelling State interest in regulating such signs in the areas described above which imitate or emulate a traffic instructional and control sign or device and which may reasonably be confusing to motorists or pedestrians in these areas.
F.
The city's intention in enacting sign legislation has never been directed at nor enforced against the content of the signs; but, has rather focused on the physical characteristics of the sign structures.
G.
The city finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, signs at the entrances to subdivisions of developments are for the purpose of providing guidance and to enable both the traveling public and public safety personnel responding to emergencies to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow the maximum expressive potential to sign owners. The city further finds that holiday decorations are not signs, but rather seasonal ornamentation not controlled by this chapter.
H.
The city council finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals and entities may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well as a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. The city council intends by enacting this chapter to:
1.
Balance the rights of individuals and entities to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
2.
Protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and the aesthetics of the city;
3.
Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan;
4.
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
5.
Improve pedestrian and traffic safety;
6.
Maintain the historical image of the city;
7.
Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
8.
Promote economic development;
9.
Protect the public traveling along the highways from distractions, aesthetic desecration, and nuisances, all associated with the proliferation of signs in a concentrated area along the highway (Turner Communications Corp. v. Georgia Dept. of Transp., 139 Ga. App. 436, 228 S.E.2d 399 (1976)); and
10.
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

2.
The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, beaming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign.
In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zoned lot, whichever is greater (surveyor's certificate required). Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the street before the height limitations are applied (surveyor's certificate required). At no time shall any sign's overall height exceed the zoning district's height limitations. Any portion of such wall or other decorative structure that is discernibly devoted to the support of the sign or, by its design or architectural treatment, intended to provide a background or frame for the sign shall be included when computing sign height.
C.
Structure. The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those parts contained within the polygon that delineates the sign face.
D.
Multi-Faced Signs. For multi-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel and are back-to-back, or where the interior angle formed by the faces is forty-five (45) degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs, the area of the sign shall be the total area on all sides that can be viewed at one (1) time from any angle.
E.
