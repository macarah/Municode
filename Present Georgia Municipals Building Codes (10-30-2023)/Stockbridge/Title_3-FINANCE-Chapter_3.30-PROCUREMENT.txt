3.30.080 - Summary of methods of procurement.
modified
In most cases, this chapter recognizes seven methods of procurement and the conditions where each method shall be used.
A.
Informal Purchase. Those purchases fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) or less do not justify the administrative time and expense for the conduct of competitive sealed bids or proposals.
B.
Competitive Sealed Bidding. In most cases the competitive sealed bid is the preferred method of procurement in the public sector and should be used whenever possible as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions should be met if possible, though are not required:
1.
Clear and adequate specifications are available.
2.
The city prefers that three (3) or more vendors compete in a procurement; however, this is a goal and not a requirement. No procurement shall be extended or delayed based on the number of offerors or bidders that have submitted proposals, bids, or quotes in response to a procurement.
3.
Cost of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00).
4.
Revenue is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00).
C.
Competitive Sealed Proposal. When use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal. Use of the proposal is dependent upon such factors as:
1.
Whether quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services.
2.
Whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the city's best interest.
3.
Whether a fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous.
4.
Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award.
5.
Cost of equipment, services or project is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00).
6.
Revenue is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00).
D.
Sole Source Purchase. A sole source procurement may be used when only one (1) vendor or supplier is able to fill requirements for the intended use, and the user agency has submitted a written memo to the procurement division justifying the use of and need for a sole source procurement. Sole source may be used for compatibility with equipment for repair purposes, or for compatibility with existing systems. Standardization may require a sole source procurement, depending upon the intended use. Standardization, which is either established as a result of past procurement(s) or by approval of the city manager, can be a satisfactory justification for a sole source. The city council shall approve all purchases when cost is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00).
E.
Emergency Purchase. The purchasing agent shall have the authority to purchase commodities and services where there exists an emergency constituting a threat to public health, safety or welfare or to the soundness and integrity of public property or to the delivery of essential services and where the adverse effects of such emergency may worsen materially with the passage of time. Acquisitions shall be made using such competitive procedures as circumstances reasonably permit. Emergencies shall be documented by the using department and submitted to the purchasing office. When a situation exists where time does not permit involvement of the purchasing office, the user department director is authorized to purchase necessary commodities or make necessary repairs. For emergencies where cost exceeds the amount authorized to a using department, written documentation shall be prepared by the user department director and submitted to the purchasing office explaining the nature of the emergency. All emergencies where cost is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) require ratification of the city council.
F.
Cooperative Purchase. The city may participate in a cooperative purchase for commodities, supplies and services when determined that it is in the best interest of the city. The sponsoring entity, whether federal, state or local must have performed a competitive procurement process and entered into a contract that stipulates allowance for other governmental entities to purchase from the supplier at the same price and under the same terms and conditions as extended to it. If such arrangement has not been made a part of the contract, written permission from the sponsoring entity and the awarded supplier must be obtained. Documentation to substantiate this decision will be maintained by the purchasing office. Cooperative purchases where the cost is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) shall be approved by the city council.
G.
Governmental and Affiliated Entity Purchase. The city may purchase services and incidental commodities from other federal, state or local governments, associations and non-profit organizations when determined to be in the best interest of the city. Documentation to substantiate this decision will be maintained by the purchasing office. Such purchases where cost is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) shall be approved by the City of Stockbridge City Council.
(Ord. No. OR 13-301, § 1, 3-11-2013; Ord. No. OR22-500 , § 1(Exh. A), 5-31-2022)
3.30.082 - Mandatory pre-qualification process.
modified
A.
Public works construction contracts governed by O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20 et seq. The purchasing agent is hereby delegated the authority to administer a process for mandatory pre-qualification of prospective bidders for public works construction contracts pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20(f).
B.
All Other Contracts. The purchasing agent is authorized to determine that a process for mandatory pre-qualification for competitive sealed bids and competitive sealed proposals of bidders or proposers is appropriate for the procurement of a particular commodity or service, subject to these requirements:

2.
Criteria for pre-qualification shall be available to any prospective bidder requesting such information.
3.
There shall be a method of notifying prospective bidders of the criteria for pre-qualification.
4.
Any timely bidder or offeror may protest a procurement, including a finding of not being responsive or responsible, or apparent award or recommendation by submitting a protest in writing to the purchasing manager within five (5) business days of the posting on the city's website of the intent to award letter or upon the bidder being notified that the bidder was not selected for contract award, whichever shall occur first. Only timely, written protests delivered by statutory overnight delivery, United States Postal Service, email, or hand delivered will be considered. A decision will be issued by city officials within ten (10) business days unless the city extends such deadline if necessary. Any decision of the city may be further appealed to the Superior Court of Henry County.
5.
No bid or proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the city from a prospective bidder who has not been pre-qualified on the procurement in question where the invitation to bid or request for proposals specified that pre-qualification would be mandatory, and any bid or proposal received shall be returned to the prospective bidder unopened.
(Ord. No. OR 13-301, § 1, 3-11-2013; Ord. No. OR22-500 , § 1(Exh. A), 5-31-2022)
3.30.090 - Purchases based on informal procurement.
A.
General. Procurements that involve amounts fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) or less do not require a formal sealed bid/proposal process.

C.
Procedures. Procurement within this category shall be made in accordance with the informal purchase procedures established by the purchasing agent. These procedures will cover purchases delegated to user departments as well as those handled through the central procurement process. Such operational procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition for the supply, service or construction being purchased. Further, such operational procedures shall require the preparation and maintenance of written records to adequately document the competition obtained, properly account for the funds expended and facilitate audit/review of the transaction.

1.
Those that may be made directly by the using department.
