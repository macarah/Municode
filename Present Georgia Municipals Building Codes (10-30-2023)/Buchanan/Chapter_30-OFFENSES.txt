In order to ensure attractive residential and commercial areas, it is necessary that an audibly satisfying environment be maintained.

ARTICLE III. - MINORS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Secs. 30-59—30-88. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - CURFEW

Sec. 30-89. - Purposes.
The city council has determined that:
(1)
Persons under the age of 17 years are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful activity and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime.
(2)
There has been a significant breakdown in the supervision and guidance normally provided by parents for minors resulting in an increase in the crimes, substance abuse, and school dropout rates, juvenile pregnancy, and other illicit behavior.
(3)
The city has an obligation to provide for the protection of minors from each other and from other persons, for the enforcement of parental control over and responsibility for children, for the protection of the general public, and for the reduction of the incidence of juvenile criminal activities which are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances.
(4)
A curfew for those under the age of 17 years will be in the interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare and will help attain the foregoing objectives and diminish the undesirable impact of such conduct on the citizens of the city and will promote the public good, safety and welfare.
(5)
Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm and legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had demonstrated effectiveness in many cities.
(6)
A curfew will increase parental responsibility for minors within their control and decrease minor delinquency.
