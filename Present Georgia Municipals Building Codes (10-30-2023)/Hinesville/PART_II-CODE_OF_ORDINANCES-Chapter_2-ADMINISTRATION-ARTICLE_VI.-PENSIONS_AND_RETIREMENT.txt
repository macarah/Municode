Adoption. The Adopting Employer hereby adopts the terms of the Adoption Agreement and any Addendum, which is attached hereto and made a part of this ordinance. The Adoption Agreement (and, if applicable, the Addendum) sets forth the Employees to be covered by the Plan, the benefits to be provided by the Adopting Employer under the Plan, and any conditions imposed by the Adopting Employer with respect to, but not inconsistent with, the Plan. The Adopting Employer reserves the right to amend its elections under the Adoption Agreement and any Addendum, so long as the amendment is not inconsistent with the Plan or the Internal Revenue Code or other applicable law and is approved by the Board of Trustees of GMEBS. The Adopting Employer acknowledges that it may not be able to rely on the volume submitter advisory letter if it makes certain elections under the Adoption Agreement or the Addendum.
The Adopting Employer hereby agrees to abide by the Master Plan, Trust Agreement, and rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Trustees of GMEBS, as each may be amended from time to time, in all matters pertaining to the operation and administration of the Plan. It is intended that the Act creating the Board of Trustees of GMEBS, this Plan, and the rules and regulations of the Board are to be construed in harmony with each other. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of any of the foregoing, they shall govern in the following order:
(1)
The Act creating the Board of Trustees of The Georgia Municipal Employees' Benefit System, O.C.G.A. Section 47-5-1 et seq. (a copy of which is included in the Appendix to the Master Defined Benefit Plan Document) and any other applicable provisions of O.C.G.A. Title 47;
(2)
The Master Defined Benefit Plan Document and Trust Agreement;
(3)
This Ordinance and Adoption Agreement (and any Addendum); and
(4)
The rules and regulations of the Board.
In the event that any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this Plan shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the previously existing provisions or the other section or sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases of this Plan, which shall remain in full force and effect, as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase so declared or adjudicated invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The Governing Authority hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this Plan or retained the previously existing provisions if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudicated invalid or unconstitutional.
This Adoption Agreement (and any Addendum) may only be used in conjunction with Georgia Municipal Employees Benefit System Master Defined Benefit Retirement Plan Document approved by the Internal Revenue Service under advisory letter J501718a dated March 30, 2018. The Adopting Employer understands that failure to properly complete this Adoption Agreement (or any Addendum), or to operate and maintain the Plan and Trust in accordance with the terms of the completed Adoption Agreement (and any Addendum), Master Plan Document and Trust, may result in disqualification of the Adopting Employer's Plan under the Internal Revenue Code. Inquiries regarding the adoption of the Plan, the meaning of Plan provisions, or the effect of the IRS advisory letter should be directed to the Administrator. The Administrator is Georgia Municipal Employees Benefit System, with its primary business offices located at: 201 Pryor Street, SW, Atlanta, Georgia, 30303. The business telephone number is: (404) 688-0472. The primary person to contact is: GMEBS Legal Counsel.
Authorization for Amendments. Effective on and after February 17, 2005, the Adopting Employer hereby authorizes the volume submitter practitioner who sponsors the Plan on behalf of GMEBS to prepare amendments to the Plan, for approval by the Board, on its behalf as provided under Revenue Procedure 2005-16, as superseded by Revenue Procedure 2015-36, Revenue Procedure 2011-49, and Announcement 2005-37. Effective January 1, 2013, Georgia Municipal Association, Inc., serves as the volume submitter practitioner for the Plan. Employer notice and signature requirements were met for the Adopting Employer before the effective date of February 17, 2005. The Adopting Employer understands that the implementing amendment reads as follows:
On and after February 17, 2005, the Board delegates to the Practitioner the authority to advise and prepare amendments to the Plan, for approval by the Board, on behalf of all Adopting Employers, including those Adopting Employers who have adopted the Plan prior to the January 1, 2013, restatement of the Plan, for changes in the Code, the regulations thereunder, revenue rulings, other statements published by Internal Revenue Service, including model, sample, or other required good faith amendments (but only if their adoption will not cause such Plan to be individually designed), and for corrections of prior approved plans. These amendments shall be applied to all Adopting Employers. Employer notice and signature requirements have been met for all Adopting Employers before the effective date of February 17, 2005. In any event, any amendment prepared by the Practitioner and approved by the Board will be provided by the Administrator to Adopting Employers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, no amendment to the Plan shall be prepared on behalf of any Adopting Employer as of either:
•
the date the Internal Revenue Service requires the Adopting Employer to file Form 5300 as an individually designed plan as a result of an amendment by the Adopting Employer to incorporate a type of Plan not allowable in a volume submitter plan as described in Revenue Procedure 2015-36; or
•
as of the date the Plan is otherwise considered an individually designed plan due to the nature and extent of the amendments.
If the Adopting Employer is required to obtain a determination letter for any reason in order to maintain reliance on the advisory letter, the Practitioner's authority to amend the Plan on behalf of the Adopting Employer is conditioned on the Plan receiving a favorable determination letter.
The Adopting Employer further understands that, if it does not give its authorization hereunder or, in the alternative, adopt another pre-approved plan, its Plan will become an individually designed plan and will not be able to rely on the volume submitter advisory letter.
