(g)
Arms and uniforms. Each officer and member of the Police Department shall be furnished with such uniform, arms, and police equipment as provided for by the City Council.

The equipment, arms and uniforms furnished by the City shall be and always remain the property of the City and shall be, when a change is ordered or on retirement from office, returned to the City.

(h)
Arrests. Police Officers of the City may make arrests for violations of municipal ordinances and State laws when such violations are committed in their presence or when they have obtained a valid arrest warrant from the Judge of the Municipal Court or from some other proper authority. In exercising such power of arrest, all Police Officers shall see that all necessary warnings are given to the accused as required by law.
Note— The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that whenever a person is deprived of his freedom in any significant way by the police, he is entitled by law to the following warnings: That he has a right to remain silent; that any statement he makes can and will be used as evidence against him in a court of law; that he has the right to consult with an attorney and have him present during interrogation; and that if he can be imprisoned for the offense and cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent him prior to any questioning. Neither the nature of the offense nor the nature of the penalty will affect a citizen's right to these warnings if he is in fact deprived of his freedom in some significant way. The consequence of the failure to give such warnings will be suppression in court of any self-incriminating statements made by the defendant. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, and Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25. Obstructing or hindering a law enforcement officer in the lawful discharge of his official duties is a misdemeanor. Resistance with violence is a felony. (See O.C.G.A. § 16-10-24.) For an in-depth treatment of the subject of criminal arrest, see "Criminal Arrest in Georgia: A Manual for Peace Officers" (Athens: Institute of Government, University of Georgia, 1974).
(i)
Entering private dwellings. No Police Officer shall enter a private dwelling without a search or arrest warrant unless he is in pursuit of a fugitive whom the officer has personal knowledge or probable cause to believe has committed or attempted to commit a felony.
(j)
Disposition of stolen, abandoned, or impounded property.
(1)
All personal property which comes into the custody of the Police Department, where said property has been stolen or impounded or where the ownership is unknown, shall be held for a reasonable period awaiting claim by its owner. The owner of said property, upon proving ownership and paying all expenses and costs, including reasonable charges for storage, shall have the right to have such property returned to him.
(2)
If after the expiration of the period, the property is unclaimed, the Chief of Police shall advertise the property for sale in the newspaper in which the City's legal advertisements are printed. Such advertising shall take place at least ten days before the date set for the sale and shall give a description of the property to be sold and specify the time and place of sale. If the property is still unclaimed by the time of the sale, it shall be sold as advertised and the proceeds shall be placed in the City treasury.
