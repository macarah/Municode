Cross reference— Businesses, ch. 22.

Sec. 70-346. - Statement of purpose.
The neighborhood business district established in this article is intended to permit retail business, office, and service uses that are needed to serve adjacent residential areas. In order to promote such business development so far as is possible and appropriate in each area, uses are prohibited which would create hazards, offensive and loud noises, vibration, smoke, glare, heavy truck traffic, or late hours of operation. The intent of this district is also to encourage the concentration of local business areas in locations proposed in the future land use plan to the mutual advantage of both consumers and merchants and thereby promote the best use of land at certain strategic locations and avoid the continuance of encouraging marginal, strip business development along county roads.
