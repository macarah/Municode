ARTICLE XIV. - C-4 TRADITIONAL OFFICE DISTRICT

Sec. 70-421. - Statement of purpose.
The traditional office district established in this article is intended to permit those offices and restricted business uses which will provide opportunities for local employment close to residential areas, thus reducing travel to and from work and which will provide clean, modern office buildings in a landscaped setting or the appropriate re-use of existing residential dwellings; which will provide, adjacent to residential areas, appropriate districts for uses which do not generate large volumes of traffic, traffic congestion and parking problems; and which will promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with the future land use plan. The zones are intended for those corridors in transition where residential uses are adjacent and also are still located along the corridor.
