(Res. of 2-19-1996)
Sec. 2-253. - Purchase orders.
After a requisition has been approved by the county manager or his designated representative, a formal purchase order is prepared and signed.

The vendors are not authorized to make a delivery of goods or services until they have been given the purchase order number.
(Res. of 2-19-1996; Ord. of 5-28-2013)

Some departments must be able to have access to supplies under emergency conditions (i.e. after normal working hours).

(Res. of 2-19-1996; Ord. of 1-27-2009(1); Ord. of 5-28-2013)
Sec. 2-260. - Disposition of county surplus property.
(a)
Purpose. This section establishes standards and guidelines for the disposition of county property. This section is designed to ensure that disposition of county property is handled in a consistent and efficient manner.
(b)
Declaration of property as surplus prior to sale. No property owned by the county shall be sold as surplus property under this section until the board of commissioners has adopted a resolution declaring such property as surplus and no longer necessary for county purposes and authorizing the sale thereof in accord with the terms of this section.
(c)
General disposition requirements. County property shall not be sold or exchanged for less than its fair market value. Sale of excess county property shall be made in the following manner:
(1)
Property valued less than $250.00. If the estimated sales value of the property offered for sale is less than $250.00, the county manager may negotiate a sale in the open market after such informal inquiry as he considers necessary to ensure a fair return to the county. The sale shall be documented by an appropriate bill of sale.
(2)
Property valued from $250.00 to $1,000.00. For sale of property with an estimated value of from $250.00 to $1,000.00, the county manager shall solicit informal bids orally, by telephone, or in writing from all known prospective purchasers, and a tabulation on all such bids received shall be retained as part of the permanent record. The sale shall be documented by an appropriate bill of sale.
(3)
Property valued in excess of $1,000.00. A sale of property with an estimated value of $1,000.00 or more and the award of such contract shall be made only after advertising for formal bids. Such advertising shall be at least 15 days prior to the award of a sale contract and shall be by advertisement in a newspaper or circular letters to all prospective purchasers. Bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place specified in the advertisement. A tabulation of all bids received shall be prepared and filed with the contract as a part of the permanent record. The award shall be made to the highest bidder as to price, and the sale shall be documented by an appropriate bill of sale.
(d)
Alternate disposition procedures.
(1)
As an alternative to the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, county property may be sold at the value authorized, at county public auction, to the public at its fair market value. The county manager shall make every effort to sell excess property as outlined in subsection (c) of this section; but if the property has no scrap or salvage value and a purchaser cannot be found, a statement shall be prepared by the county manager listing the prospective bidders solicited and all other efforts made to sell the property. This statement shall be referred to the board of commissioners for their authority to destroy, abandon, or otherwise dispose of such property.
(2)
As an alternative to the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, and as an alternative to the requirements of subsection (d)(1) of this section, surplus county property may also be sold through the use of websites on the internet that specialize in the sale of surplus governmental property to the public. At the time that county property is declared as surplus by the board of commissioners under this section, in the event that the board desires to authorize the sale of such property through such internet websites, it shall advise the county manager of such authority. In the event that such authority is provided to the county manager to sell county surplus on such websites, the county manager shall select the appropriate website to be utilized for such sale that, in the determination of the county manager, will provide a sale in the best interest of the county. Unless expressly approved by the board of commissioners, the fee to be paid by the county in connection with the sale of the property through such internet websites shall not exceed ten percent of the sales price of the surplus sold. Any funds from such sale shall be deposited into the general fund of the county.
(e)
Certain bidders prohibited from bidding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no elected official, appointed official, full-time county employee, part-time county employee, or the immediate family of any of such persons, shall be authorized to bid or purchase county surplus property under the terms of this section. For purposes of this section, the term "immediate family" shall include husband, wife, children, mother, father, brother, or sister, whether or not living in the same household.
(f)
State law authority. Nothing herein shall prohibit the board of commissioners from authorizing the sale, conveyance or transfer of real or personal property owned by the county in a manner authorized or required by applicable state law, but in no event shall any person referred to in subsection (e) of this section be authorized to purchase such county property even where such property is disposed of under applicable state law.
(Res. of 2-19-1996; Ord. of 6-6-2006; Ord. of 10-24-2006; Ord. of 5-28-2013)
Sec. 2-261. - Waiver of bid requirements for purchases of used equipment for a purchase price not exceeding $50,000.00.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, the governing body shall be authorized, by a majority vote, to waive the solicitation of bids for any purchases of used equipment in amounts not exceeding $50,000.00 if the following requirements with respect to such proposed purchase are met:
(1)
The equipment to be purchased is used;
(2)
The equipment to be purchased is in such condition that it may be, upon delivery, immediately put in operation by the county department to which such equipment is assigned without substantial repairs;
(3)
The used equipment must be either offered for sale directly by another governmental entity, by or through an online bid site used primarily by governmental entities for the sale of used equipment, or from a private vendor;
(4)
It must be verified prior to approval of the purchase that the purchase price is consistent with current market prices of similar used equipment as established by recent sales, published valuations, and other verifiable sources of price information;
(5)
There must be a determination by the board of commissioners that there is an immediate necessity for the purchase of such equipment so that requiring normal bid processes would potentially jeopardize the public health or safety;
(6)
The purchase price of the used equipment does not exceed $50,000.00.
No purchase of used equipment shall be divided into its component parts in an attempt to meet the $50,000.00 purchase price limit under this section.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no purchase of used equipment shall be authorized unless funds for such purchase have been appropriated in the current annual county budget.
