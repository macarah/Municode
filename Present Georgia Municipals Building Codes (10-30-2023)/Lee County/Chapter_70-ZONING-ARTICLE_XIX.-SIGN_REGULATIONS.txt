Editor's note— Ord. of 9-28-2010 amended Art. XIX in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. XIX, §§ 70-641—70-653, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. of 12-2-02, §§ 70-641, 70-642, 70-644—70-653; Mo. of 6-20-2005; Res. No. Z05-030, 9-23-2005.

Sec. 70-641. - Statement of purpose.
In adopting these sign regulations, it is the intent and purpose of the Board of Commissioners of Lee County not to impose an outright ban on signs, but instead to:
(1)
Balance the right of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
Further the objectives of the county's comprehensive land use planning;
(3)
Protect the public health, safety and welfare;
(4)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(5)
Maintain the historical and cultural heritage and image of the county; and
(6)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(7)
Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(8)
Promote economic development and tourism;
(9)
Protect private property values; and
(10)
Ensure the fair consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
In accessing how to go about the above described task, the Lee County Board of Commissioners has given considerable weight and find the following to be relevant and useful to the Lee County Board of Commissioners concerning the size, location and quantity of sign structures within the county and must be regulated in order to achieve the above-stated intents and purposes: University of Georgia Land Use Clinic (2003, June 26); Sign Control on Rural Corridors: Model Provisions and Guidance, Wisconsin Department of Transportation (1994, December); Milwaukee County Stadium Variable Message Sign Study: Impacts of an Advertising Variable Message Sign on Freeway Traffic; Scenic America (2007); Billboards in the Digital Age: Unsafe (and Unsightly) at Any Speed; Scenic America Issue Alert, Nasar, Jack L. and Hong, Xiadong (1999, September); Visual Preferences in Urban Signscapes, Journal of Environment and Behavior, 31(5), 671-691; Office of Safety Research and Development, Federal Highway Administration (2001, September 11); Research Review of Potential Safety Effects of Electronic Billboards on Driver Attention and Distraction, U.S. Department of Transportation; New York State Department of State, Division of Local Government Services (2006, January); Municipal Control of Signs, James A. Coon Local Advertising in 268 U.S. Jurisdictions; Outdoor Advertising Association of America, Inc.; City Club of Portland (1996, September 6); Billboard Regulation in Portland, City Club of Portland Bulletin, 78(13), 1-40; Smiley, Alison and Persaud, Bhagwant, et al. (2205); Traffic Safety Evaluations of Video Advertising Signs, Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 1937, 105-112.
In adopting these sign regulations, the Lee County Board of Commissioners has carefully considered and especially recognize the case law coming from Georgia courts, the federal courts, and courts throughout the United States, which recognize that the regulation of the size, location and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the above-stated intents and purposes, and that such intents and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests, which include the following: Granite State Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga., 193 Fed. Appx. 900 (C.A. 11th 2006) (finding that the stated goals within a sign ordinance of protecting against traffic hazards and the adverse impact on the count's aesthetic qualities are substantial government interests); Gregory v. Clive, 2007 WL 2914515 (Ga. S. Ct. 2007) (recognizing as within a local government's police power to enact legislation governing billboards and signs, as such legislation clearly addresses the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community); H & H Operations, Inc. v. City of Peachtree City, Ga., 248 Ga. 500 (1981) (holding that, under its police power, a municipality can enact and enforce reasonable regulations governing the erection and maintenance of signs within its jurisdiction); Harnish v. Manatee County, Florida, 783 F.2d 1535 (C.A. 11th 1986) (finding that aesthetics is a substantial governmental goal which is entitled to and should be according weighty respect, and that the governmental entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the environment must be given discretion in determining how much protection is necessary and the best method of achieving that protection); Lamar Advertising Company v. City of Douglasville, Ga., 254 F. Supp. 2d 1321 (N.D. Ga. 2003) (finding that where a sign ordinance asserts the goals of public safety, traffic safety, health, welfare and aesthetics, a municipality has shown an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech); Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) (holding that the goals of traffic safety and aesthetics advanced by a municipality as justification for regulating signs is a substantial governmental interest); St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. City of St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269 (1919) (finding that billboards may be prohibited in the residential districts of a city in the interest of the safety, morality, health and decency of the community); Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) (finding that a government entity can regulate signs and billboards when necessary to advance a significant and legitimate state interest, such as the protection of the aesthetics and quality of life within its jurisdiction); City of Doraville v. Turner Communications, Corp., 236 Ga. 385 (1976) (finding that under its police power authority, a municipality can regulate the location and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs within their territorial jurisdiction); Spratlin Outdoor Media, Inc. v. City of Douglasville, 2006 WL 826077 (N.D. Ga. 2006) (upholding sign ordinance where the ordinance's height and setback restrictions were rationally related to its stated goals of promoting the health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community, promoting the orderly and beneficial development of the city, promoting adequate access to natural light and air, improving the aesthetic appearance of the city, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and buildings in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan).

In the event that any billboard sign is legally existing at the time of the adoption of this article, but not included on such list, the owner of such sign shall have a period of 90 days running from the adoption of this article to register such sign with the director of planning and engineering, who, upon confirming that such sign is a billboard lawfully existing as of the date of the adoption of this article, shall place such sign on the list. The director of planning and engineering shall place a notice in the legal organ of Lee County once each month during such 90-day period advising owners of billboard signs that they should register the sign with the director of planning and engineering within such 90-day period. For the purposes of this amortization section, any billboard which has not been registered shall be presumed to not be a lawfully-existing billboard existing as of the time of the adoption of this article unless the owner thereof can show that the billboard structure was existing in its current location, design, height and sign face size on the date of the adoption of this article. During such 90-day period, there shall be a moratorium on the issuance of any permits for the erection of billboard sign structures to allow for the registration of existing signs.

(d)
Owners of property on which signs subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) above are located, or their designated agent, may apply for an extension of time at any time prior to or within 30 days after the expiration of the one-year period provided in subsection (c).

(1)
Name of the property owner making application;
(2)
Address and tax parcel number of property upon which the sign is located;
(3)
Physical description of sign, including height of structure and square footage of sign face;
(4)

(8)
A survey or plat showing the location of all sign structures on the lot upon which the subject sign is located;
(9)
A statement from the signs owner of how long of an extension is anticipated to be needed in order to realize a reasonable return on the sign structure.

Notice of such hearing shall be given to the applicant and to owners of properties adjoining the subject property, as shown by the records of the county tax assessor. At such hearing, the applicant and the zoning department staff may present testimony and evidence, and the county commission shall allow other interested persons to present testimony and evidence, provided that the applicant shall be allowed equally opportunity to address any evidence raised by such other persons.
(f)
The application shall be granted if the extension is necessary for the property or sign owner to realize a reasonable return on the capital cost of the sign, or if the sign structure serves a commercial or non-commercial purpose which cannot be adequately achieved with conforming signage. In making this determination, the county commission shall consider the following factors:
(1)
Can the sign structure be brought into conformity with the ordinance without having to be moved or removed?
(2)
If the sign structure can be brought into conformity, what is the cost of doing so?
(3)
If the sign structure can be brought into conformity, would the cost of doing so prevent a reasonable return of capital to the sign owner?
(4)
If the sign cannot be brought into conformity and must be removed, has the owner realized a reasonable return on the capital cost in comparison to the reasonable investment expectations in the area?
(5)
If the sign owner has not realize a reasonable return on the capital cost in comparison to the reasonable investment expectations in the area, what period of time would be necessary for the owner to receive a reasonable return of capital?
(6)
Would the removal of the sign impair a commercial or non-commercial purpose which cannot be adequately achieved with conforming signage?
Upon the conclusion of the evidence, the county commission may table the matter to a future meeting, or it may vote to deny the extension of time, grant the extension of time, or grant the extension of time subject to reasonable mitigating conditions. Any grant shall expressly state the duration of the additional time granted by the county commission. Such decision shall be reduced to writing and delivered to the applicant.
(g)

Upon the filing of such an appeal, the county attorney's office shall compile the record of the application and the hearing on that application, certify it, and shall file same with the superior court.
