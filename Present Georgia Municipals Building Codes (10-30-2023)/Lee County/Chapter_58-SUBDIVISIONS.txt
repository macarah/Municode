Sec. 58-159. - Effect of approval of general development plan.
(a)
An approved general development plan is designed to serve as a guide for the applicant's preparation of the subdivision and the board of commissioners, planning commission and the planning department's review of future preliminary and final plats. Approval of a general development plan grants the developer the authority for five years, subject to engineering and environmental considerations, to submit the planned development phases for subdivision approval provided that the phases submitted are consistent with the approved general development plan.
(b)
Each phase of the development shall be separately granted preliminary and final approval pursuant to major subdivision review procedures. Each section of a phased development must be planned and constructed in such a way that adheres to the approved general development plan concept and which meets all applicable design standards. Each phase of the development must be able to exist independently and effectively if no further phases are completed.
(c)
The planning director may approve preliminary plats of phases with slight deviations from the approved general development plan but may require the submission of a revised general development plan if the changes are determined to significantly affect the character or performance of the development.
(d)
The planning commission may grant the rights referred to in subsection (a), (b) and (c) of this section for such period of time longer than five years that it determines to be reasonable in light of either the anticipated period of time required to complete construction under the approved general development plan or such other circumstances peculiar to the particular development plan that the planning commission may find applicable.
(e)
Each proposed general development plan shall include a designation of areas constituting parks, jointly owned public space, or greenspace on the proposed plat filed with the proposed general development plan at the time such plan is submitted for approval.

Upon approval of the areas constituting parks, jointly owned public space, or greenspace, there shall be no reduction of the areas constituting such parks, jointly owned public space, or greenspace areas, no relocation of the areas constituting such parks, jointly owned public space, or greenspace area, nor any construction within the areas constituting such parks, jointly owned public space, or greenspace areas without such changes being presented to the planning commission for review and approval, subject to the right of the applicant to appeal the decision of the planning commission to the governing body of Lee County as authorized by this Code in connection with the appeal of decisions of the planning commission regarding a proposed development plan to the governing body of Lee County.
