(a)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(5)
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and
(6)
Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.
(b)
Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the city.
(c)
Designation of ordinance administrator. The director of community development ("director") or his designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article.

Substantial improvement.
(1)
The term "substantial improvement" means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means:
a.
The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or
b.
In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
(2)
The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
(3)
The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is a condition in which the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(Ord. No. 08-02-22, art. 3, § 3, 2-6-2008; Ord. No. 09-05-50, art. 3, § 3, 5-5-2009)
Sec. 14-80. - Standards for development.
(a)
Definition of floodplain boundaries.
(1)
Studied A zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available.
(2)
For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the city. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the city, then the director may require it to be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the city.
(b)
Definition of floodway boundaries. The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the city. If floodway data is not available from the city, then the director may require it to be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the city.
(c)
General standards.
(1)
No construction or structures, including grading, filling, cutting or displacement of earth shall be allowed within the regulatory floodplain that could result in any of the following:
a.
Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot;
b.
Reducing the base flood or future-conditions regulatory flood storage capacity;
c.
Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the property; or
d.
Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation.
(2)
Any development within the existing or future-conditions floodplain allowed under subsection (a) of this section shall also meet the following conditions:
a.
Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel;
b.
Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than two percent;
c.
Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased;
d.
Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of this section;
e.
Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from floodwaters; and
f.
Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the city community development department using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final letter of map revision (LOMR).
(d)
Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the existing or future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of section 14-81(d) apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the state and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the city community development department prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the existing or future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include:
(1)
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
(2)
Step-backwater analysis, using a method approved by the city community development department. Cross sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles and future-conditions flood profiles, when required;
(3)
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and, when required, future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development;
(4)
The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all existing and, when required, future-conditions floodplain encroachments.
(e)
Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except when required for the construction of bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and
(2)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the city community development department.
(f)
Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The city may direct the property owner (at no cost to the city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the city community development department.
(Ord. No. 08-02-22, art. 3, § 4, 2-6-2008; Ord. No. 09-05-50, art. 3, § 4, 5-5-2009)
Sec. 14-81. - Provisions for flood damage reduction.
(a)
General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions apply:
(1)
New construction of principal buildings (residential or nonresidential), including manufactured homes, shall not be allowed within the limits of the existing floodplain or the future-conditions floodplain when such limits have been determined.
(2)
New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
(3)
New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
(4)
New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
(5)
Elevated buildings. All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished and flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
a.
Designs for complying with this requirement must be certified to comply by a professional engineer and meet the following minimum criteria:
1.
Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
2.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
3.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions;
b.
So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and
c.
The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
(6)
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located three feet above the base flood elevation or one foot above the future-conditions flood elevation, when those elevations have been determined, whichever is higher so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

In addition, on-site measures shall be implemented, where necessary, to protect upstream and downstream properties and drainage channels from the site to the off-site facility.
(2)
A stormwater management plan must be submitted to the city community development department which shows the adequacy of the off-site or regional facility.
(3)
To be eligible for a modification, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director that the use of an off-site or regional facility will not result in the following impacts to upstream or downstream areas:
a.
Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and property;
b.
Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures;
c.
Excessive (damaging) streambank or streambed erosion or siltation;
d.
Degradation of in-stream biological functions or habitat;
e.
Water quality impairment in violation of state water quality standards, and/or violation of any state or federal regulations; or
f.
Premature loss of overbank trees, critical vegetation, or utilities.

Sec. 14-149. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria.
The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article:
(1)
Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
a.
It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual;
b.
Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and
c.
Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city community development department are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices.
(2)
Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer;
b.
24-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event;
c.
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.
(3)
Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (2) of this section is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided.
(4)
Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(5)
Structural stormwater controls.
a.
All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city community development department before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question.
b.
Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control.
(6)
Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (1) of this section. The applicant may, if approved by the city community development department, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.
(7)
Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public rights-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements:
a.
Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual;
b.
All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and
c.
Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual.
(8)
Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.

(3)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
(b)
Variance procedures.
(1)
Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
a.
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the city finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the mayor and city council may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
b.
Except as provided above, the mayor and city council shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the mayor and city council. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
(2)
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
b.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in this article would create an extreme hardship.
(3)
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
a.
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
1.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
2.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
3.
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
4.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
5.
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
6.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
7.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and
8.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
b.
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
1.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
2.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
3.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion;
4.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
5.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance;
6.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.
(Ord. No. 08-02-22, art. 6, § 5, 2-6-2008; Ord. No. 09-05-50, art. 6, § 5, 5-5-2009)
Sec. 14-178. - Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements.
(a)
This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
(b)
Additional standards which apply and will be enforced by the city are:
(1)
Metropolitan River Protection Act and Chattahoochee Corridor Plan requires a 50-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer and 150-foot impervious surface setback on the Chattahoochee and its impoundments and a 35-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer (all measured from the edge of the water) on perennial tributary streams in a Corridor extending 2,000 feet from either bank of the river and its impoundments. The Corridor extends from Buford Dam to the downstream limits of the Atlanta region (Douglas and Fulton Counties). Streams in the basin of the Corridor are required to be protected by buffers, but no required width is specified (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.).
(2)
DNR Part 5 Criteria for Small (under 100 square miles) Water Supply Watersheds Authorized under Part V of the Georgia Planning Act of 1989 require 100-foot undisturbed buffers and 150-foot setbacks on all perennial streams within seven miles upstream of a public water supply reservoir or public water supply intake. Beyond seven miles, the required buffer is 50 feet and the required setback is 75 feet. Equivalent protection measures can be adopted with approval from Georgia DCA and DNR.
(3)
DNR Part 5 Criteria for River Protection Authorized under the 1991 Mountains and River Corridors Protection Act require a 100-foot buffer along rivers with average annual flows of greater than 400 cfs (excepting the portion of the Chattahoochee referenced above). The buffer is measured from the top of the streambank.
(4)
Other such state and federal regulations as may be adopted from time to time.
(c)
While the requirements of this article are intended to apply to all streams in the city, special conditions may exist that require greater protection. Nothing in this article should be construed as preventing the establishment of wider and/or more restrictive buffers and setbacks as required under any other existing or future legislation.

The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines issued by the director, EPD. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute noncompliance with any land disturbing permit issued by the city or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act for each day on which such failure occurs. When such noncompliance is identified by the director, official notice will be posted on that property or provided to the property owner, contractor, developer or person in charge of or conducting the land disturbing activities.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur as outlined by the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System requirements.
(c)
Protections. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and/or minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Proper erosion control measures must be installed along site boundaries prior to land disturbing activities. Stripping of vegetation, regrading, and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner to minimize erosion and prevent soil erosion from leaving the site.
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum.
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to minimum erosion potential.

Disturbed soil shall be stabilized by the close of each business day for utilities, For all other activities, disturbed soil shall be stabilized as soon as practical but within 14 calendar days for all areas that have reached final grade or are idle.
(6)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect all exposed areas (especially steep cuts and/or banks, etc.) during development.
(7)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed upon achieving final grade.
(8)
Sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, sediment barriers, construction exits or similar best management practices as outlined in the Erosion and Sediment Control Manual until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this section, and O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.
(9)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills.
(10)
Where cuts and fills are located adjacent to neighboring properties, sound engineering practices or methods shall be employed to protect those adjoining properties.
a.
All slopes shall be stabilized immediately and shall remain so for a period of no less than one year from the issuance of the project's final certificate of occupancy and/or the recording of a final plat.
b.
All slopes greater than or equal to 3H:IV must be permanently stabilized with structural or vegetative best management practices.
c.
A plan must be submitted to demonstrate that all slopes associated with fill/cut sections have been adequately designed to be stabilized structurally (such as retaining walls) or vegetatively (erosion mat/blanket, tree bark mulch, etc.). Such analysis, reports, or design shall be prepared and approved by a certified design professional.
(11)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels.
(12)
Migrated soil materials or soil materials displaced by mechanical means from land disturbing sites to adjacent watercourses, such as lakes, ponds, streams, creeks, etc., must be remediated. The remedial work shall be conducted as per a remedial plan approved by the city.

Land disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 25 feet of the banks of any state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director, EPD determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment where otherwise allowed by the director, EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications are implemented; provided, however, that buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director, EPD as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer.
a.
No land-disturbance activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed, except as otherwise provided by this subsection (15).
b.
Temporary structural best management practices are required to be removed at the completion of project. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim underbrush in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed.
c.
Except as otherwise described in this article, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director, EPD determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director, EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where drainage structures or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by director, EPD as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer.
d.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(16)
In addition to the buffer established in subsection (c)(15) of this section, the city has also established an additional local stream buffer as defined in article VII of this chapter.

Sec. 14-210. - Land disturbance application/permit process.
(a)
General. The property owner, developer, and designated planners and engineers shall review any general development plans and detailed plans that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning resolution, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, stream buffer protection ordinance, this article, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. However, the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit.
(b)
Application requirements.
(1)
Prior to any land-disturbing activity, the property in question must be part of an approved and recorded legal lot of record (exemption plat, minor plat, or final plat). Additionally, no land-disturbing activity, including grading, excavating, filling, and/or foundation work, shall be conducted within the city, until a land-disturbance permit or a building permit (for those projects not requiring a land-disturbance permit under this article) shall have been issued by the director allowing such activity, pursuant to the provisions herein provided. If a project is to be developed in phases, then a separate land disturbance permit or building permit is required for each phase. Where the total disturbed acreage for the project or phase exceeds 25 acres, a phased erosion, sediment and pollution control plan shall be submitted which indicates no more than 25 acres of land disturbance at any given time. Additional land may be disturbed as soon as temporary or permanent stabilization measures, as defined in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, latest edition, have been implemented. In no case shall the area of active land disturbance exceed 25 acres with the prior approval of the director.
(2)
No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the department of community development or its successor to perform such activity.
(3)
All developments, construction, improvements, utilities, and demolitions that occur within the boundaries of the incorporated limits of the city that disturb more than one acre of land or are part of larger common plan of development with a planned land disturbance of one acre or greater shall be required to submit an application for a land-disturbance permit.
(4)
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the department of community development and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 14-209(b) and (c). Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by the specified number of copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans and a physical address of the property owner (post office box not acceptable). All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board.
(5)
A minimum fee, as set by the city council, shall be charged for each acre, or fraction thereof, of the project area.
(6)
The permit applicant may be required to post a bond (surety) in a form acceptable to the director of community development prior to issuing the permit. The bond amount shall be determined as established by the department. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the city may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, desilting detention ponds, water bodies, stormwater facilities, roadways, installing a fence with locking device, reestablishing damaged buffers, and similar or related actions. If a permit applicant has had two or more outstanding violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the city may deny the permit application.
(c)
Plan requirements. Refer to the city erosion and sedimentation control plan administrative guidelines for procedures and requirements concerning the review and approval of construction plans.
(d)
Permits and development activity.
(1)
Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the city of a completed application, provided that any necessary variances have been obtained, bonding has been provided, and specifications developed, maintained and permitted by the department of community development have been met.
(2)
No permit shall be issued by the city unless the city has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 14-209(c)(15) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
(3)
If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase to include the development sequence.
(4)
The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the city, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him of the conditions contained in the permit as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan.
(5)
Sedimentation basins shall not be allowed in state waters or other perennially flowing streams.
(6)
The permittee shall ensure that engineering and construction on any land within the city shall be carried out in such a manner as to protect neighboring persons and property from damage or loss resulting from stormwater runoff, soil erosion, or deposition upon private property or public streets or water-transported silt or debris.
(7)
The director during field inspections may require revisions, addendum, and modifications that address any and all features to ensure compliance with this article and any permit issued hereunder.
(8)
It shall constitute noncompliance with this article to engage in land-disturbance activity involving clearing, grading, or grubbing without a permit, which activity may immediately warrant citation(s). Timber harvesting activities shall require notification in accordance with the standards provided in article IX of this chapter and O.C.G.A § 12-6-24.
(9)

(b)
The city may require persons or firms subject to the timber harvesting notice requirement to deliver a bond or letter of credit as provided by this subsection, in which case notice shall not be or remain effective for such harvesting operations unless and until the person or firm providing such notice has delivered to the governing authority or its designated agent a valid surety bond, executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state, protecting the city against any damage caused by such person or firm in an amount specified by the city not exceeding $5,000.00 or, at the option of the person or firm harvesting timber, a valid irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank or savings and loan association, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 7-1-4, in the amount of and in lieu of such bond. For purposes of this subsection, any such surety bond or letter of credit shall be valid only for the calendar year in which delivered.
(c)
For activities other than timber harvesting the required bond amount will be 125 percent of the total cost for replanting trees to satisfy the density standards for the project site. A tree replacement cost obtained from a plant nursery will be provided to the director of the community development department with the clear-cut request and the bond amount will be based on the tree replacement cost. The director of the community development department reserves the right to request additional replacement cost if deemed appropriate. The director of the community development department will hold the bond until the project activity, including tree replacement to satisfy the site density requirements, is completed. If, upon issuing the land disturbance permit, the property is clear cut and there are no construction or development activities conducted within six months, the director of the community development department will attempt to contact the property owner (via certified mail) for a project update. Should the property owner not respond within 30 days of receipt of the status request, the bond will be used to re-vegetate the project site.
