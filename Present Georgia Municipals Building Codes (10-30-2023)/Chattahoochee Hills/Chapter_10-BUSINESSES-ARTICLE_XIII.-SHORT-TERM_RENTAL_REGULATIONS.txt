ARTICLE XIII. - SHORT-TERM RENTAL REGULATIONS

Sec. 10-360. - Intent and purpose.
(a)
The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations, procedures, and standards for the use of privately owned residential dwellings as short-term rentals that both maximize and ensure the collection and payment of hotel motel occupancy taxes as provided in chapter 28, article III (hotel and motel tax) of this Code and prevent the negative effects of such use on surrounding residential areas and neighbors. It is the city's intent to establish short-term rental regulations that require compliance with code, permitting and other legal requirements; that promote a mix of lodging options that support the City of Chattahoochee Hills's tourism base and local economy; that allow for residents of the community to supplement their incomes through appropriately renting their properties; that uphold the health, safety, and welfare of the public; and that protect homes and neighborhoods by ensuring that the impacts of short-term rentals do not adversely affect the residents and character of residential areas.
(b)
Additionally, this section is intended to ensure that the number of occupants within such rental units does not exceed the reasonable capacity of the dwelling and property to cause health and safety concerns, and that minimum health and safety standards are maintained to protect visitors and neighbors from unsafe or unsanitary conditions.
(c)
This chapter is not intended to provide any owner of residential property with the right or privilege to violate any private conditions, covenants, and restrictions applicable to the owner's property that may prohibit the use of such owner's residential property for short-term rental purposes that would otherwise be permitted by this chapter.

The owner is required to obtain a short-term rental permit and a business license from the city before the owner or the owner's authorized agent or representative may rent or advertise a short-term rental unit. No short-term rental use may occur in the city except in compliance with this chapter.
(c)
A short-term rental permit and business license shall be renewed on an annual basis to remain valid. A new owner of a short-term rental unit that had been issued a short-term rental permit to a former owner shall apply for a new short-term rental permit if the new owner plans to continue to use the residential dwelling as a short-term rental unit, subject to the first come, first served limitation of section 10-364(b). When an owner or an owner's authorized agent or representative converts non-bedroom spaces and areas in an existing residential dwelling into additional bedrooms, the owner shall apply for a new short-term rental permit if the owner intends to continue to use the residential dwelling as a short-term rental unit.
(d)
A short-term rental permit and business license shall be valid only for the number of bedrooms in a residential dwelling equal to the number of bedrooms the city establishes as eligible for listing as a short-term rental unit and shall not exceed the number of bedrooms allowable for the number of occupants as set forth in section 10-365(b). The city may determine the maximum number of bedrooms in a residential dwelling with multiple bedrooms eligible for use as a short-term rental unit upon issuance of a short-term rental permit. When determining the maximum number of bedrooms eligible for use as short-term rentals, the city shall consider the public health, safety, and welfare, shall comply with fire, building and residential codes, and may rely on public records relating to planned and approved living space within the residential dwellings, including, but not limited to, official county records, and tax assessor records. An owner and/or owner's authorized agent or representative may not advertise availability for occupancy of a short-term rental unit for more than five bedrooms or 12 occupants in any case.
(e)
The allowable number of bedrooms shall meet all applicable requirements under federal, state and city Codes and all applicable building and construction codes in this Code.

For example, a residential dwelling with three bedrooms may permissibly host a total number of six occupants and therefore requires two on-site parking spots.
Pursuant to section 3.25.070(R), in HM or VL districts, no more than one on-street parking spot may count towards the number of on-site parking spots necessary to meet the "adequate onsite parking" requirement unless more spaces are dedicated to the structure in question and are reserved for the use of the applicant residential dwelling only or if parking is available in an open public lot. Any designated parking shall be no more than 100 yards from the front door of the applicant residential dwelling as measured by the shortest route of travel.
