ARTICLE X. - TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS

Sec. 10-1. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to provide requirements for the siting of all wireless, cellular, television, and radio telecommunications support structures and antennas; to encourage the location of support structures in non-residential areas; to minimize the total number of support structures within the community necessary to provide adequate personal wireless services to residents of the city; to encourage the joint use of new and existing support structure sites among service providers; to locate telecommunications support structures and antennas in areas where adverse impacts on the community are minimized; to encourage the design and construction of support structures and antennas to minimize adverse visual impacts; and to enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to deliver such services to the community effectively and efficiently.
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 10-2. - Applicability.
A.
Location. No support structure or antenna shall be located in the city except as set forth in this section. Except as set forth in subsections C, D, and E of this section, the provisions, requirements, and limitations of this section shall govern the location of all wireless telecommunication, cellular telecommunication, television, microwave, or radio transmission support structure or antenna installed within the city. If any provisions in other sections of this UDC conflict with this article, the provisions of this article shall apply.
B.
Height limitations. Height limitations applicable to buildings and structures set forth elsewhere in this UDC shall not apply to support structures and antennas which comply with this section.
C.
Governmental exemption. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this section, the provisions of this section shall not apply to the city's properties, facilities, or structures.
D.
Amateur radio receive-only antennas. This section shall not apply to any support structure, or the installation of any antenna, that is 75 feet or less in height and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator from the operator's residence, or is used exclusively as a receive-only antenna; provided, however, that only one such support structure or antenna per dwelling shall be exempt from this section. Amateur radio receive-only antennas shall be located in the second or third layer unless fully screened, or located more than 600 feet from any thoroughfare right-of-way.
E.
Satellite dishes and receiving antennas are permitted as accessory structures. They shall be installed in the second or third layer and at least ten feet from any property line in any developed area or 30 feet from any property line in the rural (RL) district or required open space. Such antennas or satellite dishes shall not exceed the height of the roof line of the principal structure and no more than two such antennae or dishes shall be allowed per property. Satellite dishes shall not exceed four feet in diameter. The requirements of this article shall not apply to satellite dishes and receiving antennas that meet these criteria.
F.
Pre-existing support structures and antennas. Any support structure or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this UDC shall not be required to meet the provisions of this article. Any such support structures or antennas shall be referred to in this UDC as "pre-existing support structures" or "pre-existing antennas"; provided, however, that the placement of antennas on any nonconforming structure shall not create a vested right for the continued use of the structures should the nonconforming use cease. If an additional antenna is co-located upon a pre-existing support structure or alternative support structure after adoption of this section, then the requirements of section 10-3E (except section 10-3E.6), section 10-3G, and section 10-3H shall be met as part of the permitting process.
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 10-3. - General provisions.
A.
Principal or accessory use. A support structure and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structures. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or support structure. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a support structure or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including, but not limited to, setbacks, buffers, and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or support structure may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Support structures that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
B.
Five-year plan and inventory of existing sites. To facilitate the co-location of antennas and future land use planning, each applicant seeking to locate a new support structure, alternative support structure, or antenna, or modify any such existing structure, shall provide to the zoning administrator an inventory of its existing support structures or alternative support structures, existing support structures or alternative structures to be upgraded or replaced, and proposed support structures or alternative structures to be constructed in the next five years following the date of the application.
1.
The inventory shall include all such structures owned or leased by the applicant that are within the city limits as well as all structures within any neighboring jurisdiction which are currently capable of providing coverage or capacity within the city. This inventory shall include specific information about the location (latitude and longitude coordinates), height, design, support structure type, and general suitability for antenna co-location of each support structure or alternative structure, and other pertinent information as may be required by the zoning administrator.
2.
If the applicant does not know specific future support structure and antenna site locations but does know of areas where telecommunications facilities will be needed within the next five years to provide service, the applicant shall list the potential general locations of any facilities and identify each service area with a number that will correspond to the potential locations.
3.
The zoning administrator may share the location of existing telecommunication facility sites with other applicants seeking to locate support structures or antennas within the jurisdiction of the city, provided that the zoning administrator is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. The location of any proposed telecommunication facility sites will be protected as privileged information if the applicant so requests and it is considered as such under the applicable laws and legal authority.
C.
Co-location; design requirements. In addition to all applicable building and safety codes, all support structures shall be designed to accommodate the co-location of cellular telecommunication antennas according to the following:
1.
For support structures 120 feet or less in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology.
2.
For support structures taller than 120 feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least three providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology.
D.
Co-location; availability of suitable existing structures. No new support structure shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator that no existing support structure or existing alternative support structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. The applicant shall submit an inventory of all support structures or alternative support structures located within one-half mile of the proposed location. All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts. All required evidence must be submitted with the application. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing support structure or other structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of one or more of the following:
1.
No existing support structures or suitable alternative support structures are located within the geographic antenna placement area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
2.
Existing support structures or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
3.
Existing structures or support structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's antenna and related equipment;
4.
The cost or contractual provisions required by the support structure owner to share an existing support structure or alternative support structure, or to adapt an existing support structure or alternative support structure for sharing exceed the cost of new support structure development. Specific cost information must be submitted if this justification is to be relied upon; and
5.
The applicant adequately demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing support structures unsuitable, other than economic reasons. If the requirement of co-location will cause additional expense to the applicant, all such costs must be specifically shown.
E.
Aesthetics. The guidelines set forth in this subsection shall govern the design and construction of all support structures, and the installation of all antennas governed by this section.
1.
Support structures and/or antennas shall either maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
2.
At all support structure sites, the design of all buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the support structure facilities to the natural setting and building environment. Any equipment or cabinet that supports telecommunication facilities must be concealed from public view and made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
3.
For antennas installed on a structure other than a support structure, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical ground equipment shall be of a neutral color so as to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive. Antennas designed to appear as trees are preferred.
4.
Support structures shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or other applicable authority. If the lighting is required, the zoning administrator shall review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that causes the least visual disturbance.
5.
No signage shall be permitted upon any support structure or alternative support structure.
6.
To the extent practical, telecommunication facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with any officially designated historic structure or within any scenic view area.
7.
Access to the support structure site shall be restricted so as to minimize visibility of the access. Where possible, existing thoroughfares shall be used. Where no thoroughfare exists, access shall follow the existing contours of the land.
8.
The zoning administrator may impose additional reasonable requirements to minimize the visual impact of the facility on the surrounding area.
F.
Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all support structures:
1.
Support structures shall be set back a distance equal to the height of the support structure to any public right-of-way or occupied structure, or property line of the lot containing the support structure.
2.
Guy-wires and accessory buildings and facilities shall meet the minimum accessory use location and setback requirements.
3.
In all zoning districts, support structures shall not be located closer than 2,000 feet from any existing support structure (as measured in a straight line between the closest points of the structures).
4.
In the event an applicant clearly demonstrates that, given the structural failure characteristics of an alternative structure design, the required setbacks are excessive and unduly burdensome, the applicant may request the setbacks be reduced. In determining whether setbacks shall be reduced, consideration shall be given to both the danger from structure collapse and falling debris, such as ice, from a structure.
G.
Security fencing/anti-climbing devices. All support structures and supporting equipment shall be enclosed by fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices. Fencing shall be of chain link, wood, or other approved alternatives and shall comply with the fence requirements of section 5-11.
H.
Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern landscaping surrounding all support structures.
1.
Where adequate vegetation is not present, lots with support structures shall be landscaped with a strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the facility. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the facility.
2.
Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed and vegetation to be replanted.
3.
Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the zoning administrator to ensure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this section.
I.
Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce vehicular traffic to the site. Where the site abuts or has access to a thoroughfare, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the thoroughfare, utilizing existing curb cuts or driveways where present.
J.
Airport review. If, upon receipt of an application for the erection of any support structure or alternative support structure governed by this section, the zoning administrator deems that the proposed structure may interfere with or affect the operation of existing or proposed airport facilities, a copy of the application shall be submitted by the zoning administrator to the respective airport authority for review and recommendation.
K.
Federal requirements. All support structures must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal Communications Commission, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate support structures and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the permittee or the lessee of the support structure and antenna governed by this section shall bring such support structure and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards or regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring such support structure and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall be deemed to be a declaration of abandonment of the support structure and constitute grounds for the removal of the support structure or antenna at the owner's, permittee's, or lessee's expense.
A review and final decision for new towers shall be completed with 150 days of the application date. A 30 day completeness review is allowed and tolls the final decision deadline.
L.
Building codes; safety standards. In order to ensure the structural integrity of support structures, the owner, permittee, or subsequent lessee of a support structure or alternative support structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for support structures that are published by the electronic industries association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the zoning administrator concludes that a support structure fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee or lessee of the support structure, said party shall have 15 days to bring the support structure into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such support structure into compliance within 15 days shall be deemed a declaration of abandonment of the support structure and constitute grounds for removal of the support structure. Prior to the removal of any support structure, the zoning administrator may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee, or subsequent lessee for repair of substandard support structures and may grant a reasonable extension of the above referenced compliance period.
M.
Change of ownership notification. Upon the transfer of ownership of an interest in any support structure, alternative support structure, or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the support structure permittee shall notify the zoning administrator of the transaction in writing within 30 days.

(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 10-7. - Support structures and antennas.
A.
Placement of support structures and antennas. No support structure or antenna shall be permitted within 800 feet of any residential property (as measured in a straight line between the closest points of the property lines of the two properties) unless the applicant can show that the denial of a permit in such a location will cause a significantly harmful and permanent degradation of service which cannot be overcome by any other means including planned or potential locations which would provide the same or similar coverage or capacity. For the purposes of this section, the term "residential property" means the property on which the dwelling is located and not more than 20 acres of land. All other requirements of this article shall apply and must be satisfied prior to a permit being granted.
B.
Height standards. If the evidence establishes the necessity for placing a support structure or antenna within the areas listed in subsection (A) above, the height of such support structure or antenna shall be limited as follows:
