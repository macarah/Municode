Sec. 4-6. - Concept plan.
A.
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure a general understanding of the basic design concepts and improvement requirements of subdivisions and land developments through the submittal of a concept plan of all major subdivisions for approval by the city council.
B.
When required. All major subdivisions in hamlet (HM) or village (VL) districts shall require the submission of a concept plan to the zoning administrator for review by the planning commission and approval by the city council. Prior to application for preliminary plat approval, the city council must approve the concept plan, if required.
C.
Concept plan application and specifications. Concept plan applications shall include the following elements:
1.
Site assessment. A thorough assessment of site conditions shall be submitted, demonstrating an understanding of the natural, cultural, and historic features that will guide or constrain the design of the subdivision. This should include all existing manmade and natural features including structures; utilities; easements; soils; wetlands, floodplains; habitats for endangered or threatened species; steep slopes; streams and required stream buffers; rock outcroppings; trees; historic, cultural, and archeological resources; and any other sensitive, unique, notable, or constraining features to be retained, moved, or altered.
2.
Concept plan. A site map with areas of activity indicated with general boundaries showing proposed use categories and densities. This should include, at a minimum, commercial centers and frontages, major civic sites, terminated vistas, open spaces, entrances, major circulation thoroughfares including their typologies, walking distances from centers, and any special districts or special conditions.
3.
Statements. Statements of proposed uses, proposed densities, and proposed water supply and sewage disposal.
D.
Procedures. Upon receipt of a completed concept plan application, the zoning administrator shall forward all pertinent materials in the application to the planning commission for review and schedule the application for a public meeting before the planning commission. An application for concept plan approval must be submitted in accordance with the filing deadlines established by the city's community development department. The planning commission shall have 40 days from the date the public meeting is held to recommend that the city council approve, conditionally approve, or deny the concept plan application. The city council shall then consider the application at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The city council shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the concept plan application. The basis of the planning commission's review and the city council's action on a concept plan shall be whether the concept plan is consistent with the purposes and requirements of this UDC and all other ordinances that relate to the proposed development, as well as the comprehensive plan and other plans adopted by the city. When an application to amend the official zoning map includes a site plan and other materials that meet the requirements for a concept plan, the site plan may be approved as the concept plan in the rezoning action.
E.
Approval is conditional. The concept plan shall be conditioned upon approval of a preliminary plat, and shall not make permissible any of the uses, densities, or intensities as proposed until a preliminary plat application is submitted and approved for all or a portion of the area covered by the concept plan.
F.
Disposition. Approval of a concept plan shall be valid for a period of one year, during which time a preliminary plat application must be submitted. If a preliminary plat application is not submitted during that time, concept plan approval shall expire and be null and void.
G.
Amendments to approved concept plans. The zoning administrator is authorized to approve minor amendments to concept plans. Any proposed amendment to a concept plan that is determined by the zoning administrator to constitute a public interest shall be deemed a major amendment. For all amendments to concept plans determined to be major amendments, city council approval shall be required. The city council shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed major amendment to a concept plan. Procedures for considering a major amendment to a concept plan shall be the same as required for an initial application for concept plan approval.

The planning commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed major amendment to a preliminary plat. Procedures for considering a major amendment to a preliminary plat shall be the same as required for an initial application for preliminary plat approval.
K.
When an application to amend a concept plan also includes materials that meet all the requirements for a preliminary plat application, the preliminary plat may be approved concurrently by the planning commission, conditional on city council approval of the concept plan. The staff reports to the planning commission and the city council shall note when concurrent approval is sought.
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021; Ord. No. 23-02-254 , §§ 5, 6, 2-7-2023)
Sec. 4-8. - Construction plans and development permit.
A.
Application. Upon approval of a preliminary plat, or if no preliminary plat is required, the subdivider or land developer may apply for construction plan approval and approval of a development permit. In the case of a minor subdivision, or in cases where a preliminary plat is not required by this article, the subdivider or land developer may apply for approval of construction plans. The construction plan approval and development permitting process is administrative. No application for construction plans shall be accepted for processing nor development permit approved by the zoning administrator until a preliminary plat, if required, has been approved by the planning commission and the proposed construction plans are determined by the zoning administrator to be in substantial conformity with said approval and any conditions of such approval.
B.
Decision criteria. The only basis upon which the zoning administrator may deny a construction plan or development permit is the failure of the application to meet the requirements of this UDC or any other applicable local regulations or the failure of the construction plans and application to meet the requirements of preliminary plat approval specified by the planning commission.
C.
Certificate of approval. All copies of the construction plans shall be noted by inscription on the plan noting such approval by the zoning administrator. Construction plan approval shall expire and be null and void after a period of one year, unless activity toward improvements on the land has been initiated, or unless the zoning administrator approves an extension of time.

Prior to approval and recording of a final plat, or prior to the approval of any certificate of occupancy, if required, a registered engineer for the subdivider/developer shall submit one copy of all finished, as-built plans of improvements, demonstrating that said improvements, as installed, meet the requirements of this UDC and certifying that the plans accurately reflect actual construction and installation. The zoning administrator shall maintain all as-built thoroughfare and utility plans for future use by the city.
F.
Permits for construction in public right-of-way. Permits from the zoning administrator shall be required for construction in any public right-of-way. Permits will not be issued until such time that plans have been submitted and approved by the zoning administrator.
G.
Land disturbance permit must be approved. If construction activity contemplated results in the disturbance of an area of one acre or more, a land disturbance permit must be approved along with any building permit prior to construction.
H.
Indemnity agreement form must be filed. Prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit, an indemnity agreement form must be filed by the subdivider protecting the city against damage, repair and/or maintenance claims and liability arising out of drainage problems. The zoning administrator is hereby authorized to execute such agreements on the behalf of the city.
I.
Model home. Dwelling units may be utilized for sales offices and/or model homes. The subdivider shall be allowed no more than one building permit for a model home for each 15 lots located in the proposed subdivision.

Sec. 4-12. - Limitations on minor subdivisions.
A.
Purpose. Minor subdivisions provide certain advantages, such as a shorter application process and less public scrutiny, that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications. Given these advantages, the prospect exists that subdividers may seek to divide a parcel via consecutive minor subdivisions instead of filing for a major subdivision. It is the intent of the city council to prohibit the practice of "chain" subdivisions where a parcel divided or created by minor subdivision or major subdivision is further subdivided by the minor subdivision process. This provision shall not apply to family lots created per section 11-6.
B.
Limitations. Any parcel created by the major subdivision process after January 1, 2007 may not be further subdivided by the minor subdivision process. Land within a minor subdivision shall not be further divided unless a concept plan application is filed and approved as a major subdivision pursuant to the requirements of this UDC.
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 4-13. - Major subdivision process.
The following steps are required for the subdivision of land, except subdivisions that qualify for the minor subdivision process:
A.
Pre-application meeting. Applications for subdivision review shall not be accepted by the city unless a pre-application meeting has been held with the zoning administrator.
B.
Concept plan. The applicant may submit a concept plan subsequent to the pre-application meeting.
C.
Preliminary plat. Upon approval of the concept plan, a preliminary plat may be submitted according to the requirements of this UDC.
D.
Development permit/land disturbance permit/construction plans. Upon approval of the preliminary plat, application for development permitting may begin.
E.
Final plat. After the final plat is approved, signed, and recorded with the county clerk of superior court, the developer may sell lots.
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
