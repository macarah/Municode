Following the appropriate advertising period, the county clerk, or designee, shall prepare and provide to the commission, a spreadsheet format list of all qualified candidates whose applications were received timely by the county clerk.
(c)
Immediately after the agenda item has been called, the clerk will verbally announce the qualified candidates and present their resume. A visually projected image of the spreadsheet prepared in subsection (b) above may be substituted.
(d)
For each vacant position, except as outlined in sections 14-4(b) and 66-150(b), each commissioner may nominate anyone on the qualified list. Each nomination must receive a second to be considered for a later vote. While it is desirable to have each district represented on all county boards, authorities, and commissions as well as to have as much representation across the entire county and its constituents as possible, the greater need is to have interested, qualified, and responsible applicants who will provide the greatest contribution to Putnam County in carrying out the necessary functions of these boards, authorities, and commissions. All candidates who have received a nomination and a second can be discussed by the commissioners. Following discussion, a roll call vote will be taken. The proper response, to the call for a vote, is the name of the preferred candidate. The person receiving the majority vote of the commissioners will be the candidate selected. In those cases where there is not a tie and no one has received a majority vote, a second round of voting may be directed by the chairman.
(e)
No member of any board, authority, or commission shall be an employee of Putnam County as defined in Section I.D. of the Putnam County Personnel Manual. For the purposes of this subsection, a county commissioner is not considered an employee of Putnam County.
(f)
In the event that a position on one of the county's boards, authorities, commissions, or similarly established bodies becomes vacant prior to the expiration of its term, the vacancy shall be filled in the manner described above. If less than one year remains at the time an individual is appointed to fill such a vacancy, that individual shall also be reappointed to the position for the next successive term.
