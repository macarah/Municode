(Res. of 7-17-2007(4); Ord. of 12-4-2020(1) )
Sec. 66-32. - Designation on official zoning map.
The boundaries of the various zoning districts are shown upon the official zoning maps of Putnam County, as they may be amended from time to time and which are hereby made a part of this chapter and which shall be maintained in the office of the clerk to the board of commissioners as a public document available for public inspection and examination. The official zoning maps shall be those tax parcel maps entitled, "The Official Zoning Maps of Putnam County, Georgia, July 17, 2007," signed by the chairman of the board of commissioners, which contain land lot, district, parcel and street boundaries located in the county; and the "Aerial Photo-Sheet Index" map. All such official zoning maps and all notations, references and information shown thereon shall be as much a part of this chapter as if all the matter and information set forth by the maps were fully described in this section.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(4))
Sec. 66-33. - Interpretation of district boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on the official zoning maps, the following rules shall apply:
(a)
Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline or right-of-way line of highways, streets and alleys, railroads, land lot lines, militia district lines or lot lines, centerlines of streams, reservoirs, or other bodies of water, or civil boundaries these lines shall be construed to be these boundaries.
(b)
In unsubdivided property or tracts, where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of these boundaries, unless they are indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on these maps.
(c)
Where boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the centerline or right-of-way line of streets, alleys or highways, these boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the zoning maps. If no distance is given, this dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the maps.
(d)
In case any further uncertainty exists, the board of commissioners shall determine the location of boundaries as a request for interpretation and only after public hearing as per the policies and procedures set forth in division 2 of article IV of this chapter.
(e)
No single lot or parcel shall be located in more than one zoning district, nor shall only a portion of a lot or parcel be rezoned. In the event an owner desires to rezone a portion of a tract, the land must be separated into a lawful lot, and the remainder must also be a lawful lot, which requires a re-survey and a recorded plat. In the event a lot appears to have been placed in two separate zoning districts, the interpretive rules above shall apply, and the entire lot shall be considered to be located in the district that covers the greatest area of the lot. The sole exception shall be parcels split by a municipal boundary, since the County's zoning powers do not extend into a municipality.
(f)
Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot that is under single ownership at the time of enactment of this section, the use classification of a larger portion may be extended by the board of commissioners to the remainder without recourse to the amendment procedure.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(4); Amend. of 3-18-2008; Ord. of 12-4-2020(1) )
Sec. 66-34. - General requirements.
Statements in this section apply to the entirety of this chapter. The specific applications are dependent on the extent of the dissimilarity between the existing zoning district and the new one the following shall apply:
(a)
Nuisance. The use may not create noise, dust, vibration, smell, excessive traffic, smoke, glare or electrical interference so as to arise to the level of a nuisance.
(b)
Outside merchandise. No outside display of merchandise shall create traffic or other safety hazard. No retail items shall be parked or sold within a street right-of way. No external display of merchandise shall interfere with sight lines in a way to create traffic or safety hazards.
(c)
Allowed uses. Within the various zoning districts, as described in this article and shown on the official zoning map, no land, building or structure shall be used as a matter of right except in accordance with the uses and standards of this chapter.
(d)
Buffers and berms.
(1)
A buffer or berm, which provides visual screening, shall at the director's discretion, unless the board of commissioners has mandated otherwise, exist between any C-PUD, R-PUD, C, or I-M district and any R, RM, or MHP district or existing use. The dimensions of the buffer between adjoining uses are in Table A.

(2)
Required buffers must be separated by at least a five-foot setback from a parking area or a structure.
(3)
All buffers shall be replanted, where sparsely vegetated, with evergreen trees of at least two inches measured at diameter breast height (DBH) and with evergreen shrubs to create an understory among the trees. An evergreen ground cover shall exist throughout the buffer.
(4)
The spacing of trees when creating a buffer shall be approximately ten feet between each tree at time of planting. In order to create a solid appearance, another row of trees shall be planted ten feet behind the first row, also spaced ten feet apart so that the trees in one row visually fill the gaps in the next row (as depicted in the following diagram).
(5)
Where the use to be protected exists (or will exist) above or below the new one, the slope of the cut/fill shall constitute the buffer, provided the angular length of the slope is at least equal (in feet) to the width of the required buffer. The densest plantings of trees and understory occurs at the top of the slope diminishing as the slope proceeds downward. An evergreen ground cover shall be planted on the slope. A six-foot high fence constructed of opaque material shall be placed at the top of the cut slope.
(6)
A berm shall be no flatter than a three to one slope achieving a height above the ground throughout its entire length of not less than six feet. It may exist throughout the length of a buffer or as a separate entity within a setback.
(7)
A berm shall be planted with evergreen trees, shrubs, and ground cover in the same fashion as a buffer. If natural vegetation does not exist along a buffer area, a berm must be installed.
(8)
Unless certifiable low water consumption plantings are used, an irrigation system shall exist through the buffer or berm to ensure the continued vitality of the vegetation.
(9)
When the ground between the new and the existing uses is relatively flat, either a buffer or a berm, at the discretion of the director, shall be used. A berm may be located within a setback but a buffer may not.
(e)
Double frontage and corner lots. Lots that adjoin a public street on any side shall provide the minimum required front setback on each street.
(f)
Pre-owned manufactured home. Pre-owned manufactured homes must meet the minimum requirements as outlined in sections 18-83(b)(5), (9), (10), (11), and (12) of this Code prior to the issuance of a building permit. The building inspector shall inspect all pre-owned manufactured homes at the expense of the applicant to include, but not limited to, inspection fees and travel expenses when located outside of Putnam County. Travel expense shall be calculated based on current mileage rate used by county.
(g)
Vision clearance.
(1)
No plant, structure, fence, wall, sign, or other element between the heights of four feet and ten feet from the ground shall be placed within 20 feet of or maintained in a manner that obstructs vision at the intersection of:
• The right-of-way lines of two public streets;
• Any vehicular access drive with a right-of-way on a public street;
• Any vehicular access drive with another vehicular access drive;
• A public street's right-of-way line and a railroad;
• Two railroad lines.
(2)
Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, fences, walls, hedges, driveways and buffer areas may be permitted in any required yard or along the edge of any yard, provided that fences, walls or hedges on a corner lot in a residential district shall not exceed four feet in height. See performance standards for specific requirements on fences and walls.
(h)
Other regulations. The property owner should be aware of and consult the other ordinances that may apply to the development or use of any property, including, but not limited to, any conditions applied by the Board of Commissioners at the time the property was rezoned, the International Building Code; chapter 18, Buildings and Building Regulations; chapter 22, Businesses; chapter 28, Development Regulations; chapter 30, Environment; chapter 32, Fire Code; chapter 46, Roads and Bridges; chapter 48, Signs; and chapter 50, Solid Waste and Scrap Tires.
(i)
Parking requirements. See development standards in each district for residential requirements. For commercial and industrial/manufacturing see chapter 28, development regulations.
(j)
Projections into setbacks. Every part of a required setback shall be open to the sky and unobstructed except for the ordinary projections of sills, belt courses, cornices, eaves, chimneys, buttresses and other ornamental and architectural features, provided that these features do not project more than three feet into any required setback. Decks, porches, patios, carports, and similar structures (including steps to access the foregoing) are not permitted to project into the setback area. Setbacks for accessory uses are defined in each district's requirements.
(k)
Street access. Except as provided in this chapter, each building shall be located on a lot or parcel that abuts a public paved street. However, should an owner of a tract of property subdivide it so as to provide smaller parcels only to other family members for their residential use, then the new parcels so created may be accessed by recorded, permanent and private easements between the original owner (grantor) and his grantees, upon approval of the director.
(l)
Storage and parking of recreational vehicles, trailers, and other vehicles. Commercial vehicles with more than four wheels, recreational vehicles, travel trailers, campers, buses, motorized homes, boat trailers and haulers, and boats shall not be stored in the front yard in any residential district. Travel trailers, recreational vehicles, campers, motorized homes, boat trailers and haulers, and boats may be parked or stored in an enclosed garage or carport or in rear or side yards, provided that they remain more than 20 feet from the rear property line and ten feet from the side property line. No such vehicle shall be occupied for sleeping or as a residence, either permanently or temporarily, when so parked.
(m)
Lighting. All exterior lighting shall be deflected away from adjacent properties and the public right-of-way.
(n)
One principal building per lot. Only one principal building and its customary accessory buildings may hereafter be erected on any lot, unless this chapter specifically provides otherwise; further provided that more than one multi-family dwelling, office, institutional, commercial or industrial building may be located on a lot or tract.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(4); Amend. of 3-18-2008; Amend. of 4-17-2012(2); Amend. of 9-17-2013(2) ; Ord. of 12-4-2020(1) ; Ord. of 12-3-2021(1) )
Sec. 66-35. - Exceptions to general development standards.
(a)
Double buffer. When a required buffer area would abut and be continuous to an established buffer area, which meets all requirements of this chapter, then this additional required buffer area need not be established.
(b)
Height requirements. The height limitations as stated in this chapter shall not apply to:
(1)
Barns, silos or other farm structures when located on farms, belfries, cupolas and domes, monuments, water towers, windmills, chimneys, smokestacks, flagpoles, radio or television towers, masts and aerials; and
(2)
Bulkheads, elevators, penthouses, water tanks and scenery lofts and similar structures, provided that these structures shall not cover more than 25 percent of the total roof area of the building on which these structures are located.
(c)
Special building height restrictions. Where a new Village, C, or I-M, R-PUD, or C-PUD district is adjacent to an R, RM, or MHP district or to an existing residential use, the building height of the nonresidential structures shall not exceed 25 feet along the property line(s) adjacent to the herein listed residential districts.
(d)
Combining of acreage between lake lots and Georgia Power property. The owner of a lot who has exclusive use of property owned by Georgia Power by written lease, license, or other document may combine the acreage of said lot with the acreage of the property owned by Georgia Power in order to meet the requirements of the development standards of the zoning district in which said lot is located provided that both the lot and property are depicted as a single lot filed in the land records of Putnam County.

Sec. 66-36. - Undefined uses.
It is impossible to set forth each and every use of land, which may exist now or in the future in the county. If approval is sought for a use not specifically identified, the director shall consider the requested use to determine whether it is substantially similar to identified uses. For purposes of this section, the term "substantially similar" shall mean that the unidentified use shares the same characteristics as an identified use in terms of nature of operation, size of operation, impact from operation and requirements of the use. The director's decision in this regard may be appealed to the board of commissioners pursuant to the provisions in this chapter pertaining to the appeal of an administrative decision. The decision shall be kept in the official records of the county so as to ensure consistency of decision-making about heretofore-unidentified uses.

DIVISION 2. - NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS

Sec. 66-51. - Nonconformities.
This division sets out the provisions that protect uses, structures, and lots that lawfully existed prior to the adoption of the chapter or a subsequent amendment, but no longer conform to the new regulations. The primary intent of the treatment of nonconformity is to allow continuation of these uses, structures and lots until the end of their useful life, while encouraging conformance to the new regulations when it becomes reasonable to do so.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(4))
Sec. 66-52. - Nonconforming development; in general.
Lawful nonconforming uses, structures and lots are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with land uses, structures, and lots that conform to the requirements of the zoning districts in which the nonconformity exists. However, such nonconforming uses, structures, and lots may continue as set forth in this division. (Refer to chapter 48, section 48-10, for nonconforming signs.)
(Res. of 7-17-2007(4))
Sec. 66-53. - Nonconforming uses.
(a)
Nonconforming uses, defined. A nonconforming use is a use or activity that was lawfully established prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of this chapter, but which, by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment, is no longer a use or activity permitted by right or no longer meets or conforms to the requirements of this chapter.
(b)
Continuance of nonconforming uses.
(1)
To avoid undue hardship, the lawful but nonconforming use of any structure or land at the time of the enactment of the chapter or any subsequent amendment may be continued even though the use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter, except that the nonconforming use:
a.
Shall not be changed to another nonconforming use.
b.
Shall not be extended to occupy a greater area of land.
c.
Shall not be extended to occupy a greater area of a building or structure unless such additional area of the building or structure existed at the time of the passage or amendment of this chapter and was clearly designed to house the same use as the nonconforming use occupying the other portion of the building or structure.
(2)
Any intended but not yet existing nonconforming use for which a vested right was acquired prior to the adoption of this chapter or the adoption of an amendment to it shall be prohibited unless such intended nonconforming use for which a vested right was acquired is actually commenced within one year of the adoption of this chapter or the adoption of an amendment to it regardless of the intent or expectation to commence or abandon such nonconforming use.
(c)
Re-establishment of a discontinued nonconforming use. A lawful but nonconforming use of any structure or land shall not be re-established after its removal from the property, or after its discontinuance for six months or more, regardless of the intent of the owner or occupier to resume the nonconforming use. The nonconforming use of a property for occupancy by a manufactured home may be resumed if it is replaced by a conforming structure.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(4))
Sec. 66-54. - Nonconforming structures.
(a)
Nonconforming structures, defined. A nonconforming structure is a structure or building whose size, dimensions, location on a property or other features were lawful prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of the chapter, but which, by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment, no longer meets or conforms to one or more such requirements of this chapter. (Refer to chapter 48, section 48-10, for nonconforming signs.)
(b)
Continuance of nonconforming structures.
(1)
A nonconforming structure may continue to be occupied and used, except that:
a.
A nonconforming structure shall not be repaired, rebuilt or altered after damage or destruction of 50 percent or more of its fair market value, unless the structure is a residence and meets all requirements set forth by the Putnam County Health Department.
b.
A nonconforming structure may be repaired, rebuilt or altered to its original configuration after damage or destruction not exceeding 50 percent of its fair market value.
c.
Allowed reconstruction is to begin within one year after the damage or destruction is incurred; and
d.
The value shall be the then fair market value of the building or structure as determined by the Putnam County Tax Assessor.
(2)
A nonconforming structure, which is not a residence, shall not be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity, but it may be repaired to the extent necessary to maintain it in a safe and sanitary condition.
(3)
A nonconforming manufactured structure may be replaced with another nonconforming manufactured structure provided the structure is a residence, but it must be placed in the same location and not exceed previous nonconformity.
(4)
The strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of any nonconforming structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety or health shall be allowed upon order of such official.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(4); Amend. of 4-17-2012(2); Amend. of 9-17-2013(2) )
Sec. 66-55. - Nonconforming lots.
(a)
Nonconforming lots, defined. A nonconforming lot is a lot of record whose area, frontage, width or other dimensions, or location were lawful prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of this chapter, and which, by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment, no longer meets or exceeds one or more such requirements of the applicable zoning district.
(b)
Nonconforming lots of record. When two or more adjoining and vacant lots with continuous frontage are in a single ownership as of the adoption of this chapter, and these lots have a total frontage or lot area of less than two-thirds of what is required by the district in which they are located, these lots shall be replotted or reparceled so as to create one or more lots which conform to the minimum frontage and area requirements of the district.
(c)
Continuation of nonconforming lots.
(1)
Where the owner of a lot at the time of the adoption of this chapter or the owner's successor in title thereto does not own sufficient land to enable such person to conform to the dimensional requirements of the chapter, either:
a.
Such lot may be used as a building site for a single-family residence in a district where residences are permitted; or
b.
Such lot may be used as a building site for any other use permitted in the zoning district;
provided, that said lot requirements or building setbacks are not reduced below the minimum specified in this chapter by more than 50 percent; and provided that the minimum requirements of the Putnam County Board of Health can be met for lots on septic systems.
(d)
A non-conforming lot may acquire additional acreage through recombination of adjacent land without meeting the minimum requirements set forth here, so long as:
(1)
Additional acreage is legally recombined with a non-conforming lot by means of a plat approved by planning director and filed with the Putnam County Superior Court;
(2)
The recombination of additional acreage with a non-conforming lot will not result in the creation of additional non-conforming lots;
(3)
The joining lots must have the same zoning classification.
