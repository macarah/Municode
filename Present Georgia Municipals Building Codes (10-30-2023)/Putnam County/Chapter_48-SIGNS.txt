Every provision of this chapter shall be severable from all other provisions. A finding by any court of the illegality or unenforceability of any provision or provisions hereof shall not operate to void this article but, instead, all provisions not specifically and explicitly held to be illegal or unenforceable shall continue in full force and effect.

(Res. of 7-17-2007(3))
Sec. 48-4. - Computations.
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height:
(a)
Computations of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, or triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblems, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
(b)
Computation of area of multifaced signs. The sign area for the sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two sign faces are placed back-to-back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
(c)
Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the normal grade at the base of the sign to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of the existing grade prior to construction or the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is lower.
(d)
Computation of maximum total permitted sign area for a zone lot. The permitted area of all individual signs on a zone lot shall be computed by applying the standards contained in the appendices which are at the end of this article and which pertain to the various zoning districts in Putnam County. The maximum area for freestanding signs shall be dependent in part on the road frontage of the zone lot in which such sign is located. Lots fronting on two or more arterial streets shall be allowed to allocate the permitted sign area to each street frontage, without increasing the total sign area allowed. When multiple freestanding signs are erected on a single zone lot under this provision, each shall be placed at the midpoint of the applicable road frontage.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(3))
Sec. 48-5. - Signs allowed on private property.
Signs shall be allowed on private property in the county only in accordance with appendices A through G, which are located at the end of this chapter and which pertain to the various zoning districts in Putnam County.
(a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no person shall erect a sign of any type on any zone lot unless there is located on said lot a building with an area of more than 1,000 square feet unless said sign is exempt from the requirement of obtaining a permit pursuant to subsection 48-14(d).
(b)
The Georgia Department of Transportation (G.D.O.T.) shall regulate new signage along the Scenic Byway (State Route 16).
(Res. of 7-17-2007(3))
Sec. 48-6. - Sign permit required.
If a sign requiring a permit under the provisions of this chapter is to be placed, constructed, erected, or modified on a zone lot, the owner of the lot shall obtain a sign permit prior to the construction, placement, erection, or modification of such a sign in accordance with the requirements of section 48-13. Furthermore, the property owner shall maintain, at all times, a sign permit for such sign in accordance with sections 48-14, 48-15, or 48-16. No sign shall be erected in the public right-of-way except in accordance with section 48-9. No sign permit of any kind shall be issued for a proposed sign unless such sign is consistent with the requirements of this chapter (including those protecting existing signs) in every respect and with the master signage plan in effect for the property.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(3))
Sec. 48-7. - Design, construction, and maintenance.
All signs shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the following standards:
(a)
All signs shall comply with applicable provisions of "the state minimum standard codes" as defined in O.C.G.A. 8-2-20.
(b)
Except for banners, flags, temporary signs, and window signs conforming in all respects with the requirements of this chapter, all signs shall be constructed of permanent material and shall be permanently attached to the ground, a building, or another structure by direct attachment to a rigid wall, frame, or structure.
(c)
All signs shall be maintained in good structural condition, in compliance with all building and electrical codes, and in conformance with this Code, at all times.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(3))
Sec. 48-8. - Master signage plan.
No permit shall be issued for an individual sign requiring a permit unless and until a master signage plan for the zone lot on which the sign will be erected has been submitted to the inspector and approved by the inspector as conforming to this section.
(a)
Master signage plan. For any zone lot on which the owner proposes to erect one or more signs requiring a permit, the owner shall submit to the inspector a master signage plan containing the following:
(1)
An accurate plot plan of the zone lot, at such scale as the director may reasonably require.
(2)
Location of building, parking lots, driveways, and landscaped areas on such zone lot.
(3)
Computation of the maximum total sign area, the maximum area for individual signs, the height of signs and the number of freestanding signs allowed on the zone lot(s) included in the plan under this chapter.
(4)
A notarized letter from private property owners on which zone lot the signs will be placed, if applicable.
(5)
An accurate indication on the plot plan of the proposed location of each present and future sign of any type, whether requiring a permit or not, except that incidental signs need not be shown.
(b)
Limit on number of freestanding signs under master signage plan. The master signage plan for all zone lots with multiple uses or multiple users shall limit the number of freestanding signs to a total of one for each street on which the zone lots have frontage and shall provide for shared or common usage of such signs.
(c)
Consent. The master signage plan shall be signed by all owners or their authorized agents in such form as the inspector shall require.
(d)
Procedures. A master signage plan shall be included in any development plan, site plan, planned unit development plan, or other official plan required by the county for the proposed development and shall be processed simultaneously with such other plan.
(e)
Amendment. A master signage plan may be amended by filing a new master signage plan that conforms with all requirements of the ordinance then in effect.
(f)
Binding effect. After approval of a master signage plan, no sign shall be erected, placed, painted, or maintained, except in conformance with such plan, and such plan may be enforced in the same way as any other provision of this chapter. In case of any conflict between the provisions of such a plan and any provision of this chapter, this chapter shall control.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(3))
Sec. 48-9. - Signs in the public right-of-way.
No sign shall be placed in the public right-of-way, except for the following:

In addition to other remedies hereunder, the county shall have the right to recover from the owner or person placing such a sign the full costs of removal and disposal of such sign.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(3))

(1)
The exercise of the power of eminent domain is the proximate cause of said sign being affected; and
(2)
The owner of said sign is limited to replacing said sign with one in compliance with this chapter, the same sign or a replacement with the same exact dimensions, colors and type (freestanding, marquee, etc.) so that the nonconformity of said sign is in no way enlarged.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(3))
Sec. 48-11. - General permit procedures.
The following procedures shall govern the application for and issuance of all sign permits under this article and the submission and review of master signage plans:
(a)

(b)
Fees. Each application for a sign permit or for approval of a master signage plan shall be accompanied by the application fees as established by the Putnam County Schedule of Fees.
(c)
Completeness. Within five working days of receiving an application for a sign permit, a variance, or for a master signage plan, the director shall review it for completeness.

(a)
Application. An application for construction, creation, or installation of a new sign or for modification of an existing sign shall be accompanied by detailed drawing to show the dimension, design, structure, and location of each particular sign, to the extent that such details are not contained on a master signage plan in effect for the zone lot. One application and permit may include multiple signs on the same zone lot.
(b)
Inspection. The director shall cause an inspection of the zone lot for which each permit for a new sign or for modification of an existing sign has been issued during the sixth month after the issuance of such permit or at such earlier date as the owner may request. If the construction is not substantially complete at the time of inspection, the permit shall lapse and become void. If the construction is complete and in full compliance with this chapter and with the building and electrical codes, the director shall affix to the premises a permanent symbol identifying the sign(s) and the applicable permit by number or other reference. If the construction is substantially complete but not in full compliance with this chapter and applicable codes, the director shall give the owner or applicant notice of the deficiencies and shall allow an additional 30 days from the date of inspection for the deficiencies to be corrected. If the deficiencies are not corrected by such date, the permit shall lapse. If the construction is then complete, the director shall affix to the premises the permanent symbol described above.
(c)
Lapse. In the event that a permitted sign has not been substantially completed within six months of the date of the issue of the permit, said permit shall lapse and be void and of no effect.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(3))
Sec. 48-13. - Sign permitâ€”Continuing.

(a)
Initial sign permit. An initial sign permit shall be automatically issued by the director upon final inspection of the completed sign installation, construction, or modification.
(b)
Assignment of sign permits.

The assignment shall be accomplished by this filing and shall not require approval by the director.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(3))

(Res. of 7-17-2007(3); Amend. of 3-18-2008)
Sec. 48-15. - Nonconforming signs and signs without permits.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the owner of any zone lot or other premises on which exists a sign that does not conform with the requirements of this chapter or for which there is no current and valid sign permit shall be obligated to remove such sign or, in the case of a nonconforming sign, to bring it into conformity with the requirements of this chapter.
(a)
Nonconforming existing signs, permits, and terms. A sign that would be permitted under this chapter only with a sign permit, and which was in existence on the effective date hereof (July 17, 2007) and which was constructed in accordance with the ordinances and other applicable laws in effect on the date of its construction, but which for any reason is not in conformance with the requirements of this chapter or of the zoning ordinance shall not be obligated to remove such sign. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any sign located within a county right-of-way must be removed.
However, any nonconforming sign shall either be eliminated or made to conform with the requirements of this section when any proposed change, repair, or maintenance would constitute an expense of more than 50 percent of the lesser of the original value or replacement value of the sign.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(3))
Sec. 48-16. - Variances.
When, in specific cases, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in unusual hardship because of extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the size, shape, or topography of a zone lot, the director may, after application, grant a variance from the requirements of this chapter in regard to the placement or height of a sign.
(a)
Variances, conditions required. The director may grant a variance only after making findings that the following conditions exist:
(1)
There exist extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from its size, shape, or topography and which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area;
(2)
A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by owners of similar properties;
(3)
Granting the variance would not confer upon the property of the applicant any significant privileges, which are denied to similar properties;
(4)
The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant;
(5)
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare;
(6)
The variance requested is the minimum variance which will make possible the logical use of the land, building or structure; and
(7)
The variance is not a request to permit a type of sign which otherwise is not permitted in the zoning district involved.
(b)
Actions of director on receipt of an application for variance. In addition to those actions required of the director in subsection 48-11(d), the director shall enter written findings that address each condition referred to in subsection (a), above.
(Res. of 7-17-2007(3))
Sec. 48-17. - Appeals.

The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by the fee required by the schedule of fees. Such appeals shall be heard by the planning and zoning commission within 30 days of filing the notice of appeal. The decision of the planning and zoning commission may be appealed to the board of commissioners, provided that a notice of appeal is filed with the director within ten days of the decision of the planning and zoning commission. The decision of the board of commissioners may be further appealed to the superior court taken within ten days of the decision being appealed.
