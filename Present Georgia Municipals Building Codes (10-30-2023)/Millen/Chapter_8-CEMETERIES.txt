ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 8-1. - Applicability of chapter; additional regulations.
All property owners at the time this chapter is adopted and all visitors within both the Millen Cemetery and the Westside Cemetery (herein, either or both, the "cemetery"), and all lots hereafter to be sold therein, are and shall be subject to the rules and regulations set out in this chapter as formulated and adopted by the mayor and council, and subject further to such other and additional rules and regulations, amendments or alterations as shall be adopted by the city for the cemetery, both of which are public cemeteries owned and operated by the city. Reference to such rules and regulations in instruments or deeds conveying the ownership of lots and the right of interment shall have the same force and effect as if such rules and regulations were set forth therein.

Sec. 8-2. - Authority of city as to maintenance and improvements.
All grading, landscape work and improvements of any kind, and care of cemetery lots, shall be done, and all trees and shrubs shall be moved, and herbage of any kind shall be planted, trimmed, cut or removed, only by the city. Permanent planting of grasses, shrubs, flowers, etc., shall be made by the city, and further plantings may be permitted only at the discretion of the proper committee of the city. The whole cemetery is to be landscaped, and to keep it uniform all plantings shall be under the control of the city, as shall removal of rubbish when necessary, raking and cutting of grass, trimming of trees and shrubbery and other care that the city may deem necessary. The ownership of rights of interment in lots shall not convey any right to do planting or the like without express approval of the proper officials of the city. The city retains control and supervision of all lots that are sold in the sections subject to this chapter, and retains the right to have its city engineer enter upon any lot and prohibit, modify or remove any structure, object, improvement or adornment on such lot which may have been placed thereon and which may be considered objectionable or injurious to the lot, adjoining lots or the cemetery in general.
