SECTION 8. - SIGN REGULATIONS

8-1. - Purposes.
It is the purpose of the City of Millen in enacting these regulations to provide standards to safeguard life, public health, property and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, erection, maintenance and quality of materials of all signs. More specifically, signs have a powerful impact on the aesthetic environment of the community, and it is the purpose of this ordinance to encourage an aesthetically attractive environment, allowing sufficient opportunities for communications to serve business, interest groups and the public, while complying with the Federal and State Constitutions and laws. Signs create visual clutter and therefore should be regulated in their size, location, construction and illumination. Signs can detract from the beauty of the neighborhood and lower property values. In seeking to comply with federal and state law, the City has determined the following: large signs are, as the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, an aesthetic harm; the Georgia Supreme Court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of environment; and, the Eleventh Circuit has recognized portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard. These holdings show that the City's ordinance is within the law and constitutional, which is a goal of the City. The goal of this Article is to avoid being an impermissible content-based regulation, and instead to be a permissible time, place and manner restriction.
Many signs can also be a hazard and negatively impact traffic safety, by distracting drivers and blocking views of other vehicles and dangers, by making intersections more treacherous, and by making it difficult to see oncoming traffic when entering a roadway. Therefore, it is also the purpose of this ordinance to prevent those harms by regulating signs to safe locations, safe sizes, with proper and safe illumination and construction. Business owners have 90 days to remove all signs from closed business or relocated business.

Highway Signs. In addition to the signs permitted elsewhere in this ordinance, in the I-1 and I-2 Zoning Districts, the following additional permitted signs are allowed.
(a)
One additional ground sign of not more than 300 square feet per face, and not more than 35 feet in height, and not more than two-faced (back to back), may be erected on any lot that has road frontage on any U.S. Highway (e.g. 25), or any Georgia Highway (e.g. 17, 67) Such sign must be erected within 50 feet of the right-of-way of said highway. No sign of more than 250 square feet erected under this section may be erected within 2,000 feet of any other ground sign exceeding 250 square feet, whether such sign is on the same lot or another lot. No sign of less than 250 square feet erected under this section may be erected within 500 feet of any other ground sign exceeding 100 square feet, whether such sign is on the same lot or another lot.
(b)
Distances between signs are measured from the closest points of the signs at issue, whether that is the sign base or a portion of the sign structure.
(c)
No sign erected under this section may be "double stacked"; that is, have two separate signs one higher than the other, both facing the same direction. Double stacked signs are permitted under other provisions of this ordinance.
(d)
It is the intent of this section to allow more signage along certain higher traffic corridors, while at the same time protecting the appearance of the City of Millen. Whenever the distance requirements of this section would, if applied strictly, result in denying a person all opportunity for additional signage allowed under this section, because of the existence of a sign or signs on the property of another person or entity, a variance may be issued, subject to the procedure provided in the zoning ordinance, that both serves the interests of the City in adopting this sign ordinance, and also affords to such person reasonable additional signage. However, no variance shall be granted where the hardship is the result of the property owner or his predecessor-in-title's subdivision of the property.
8-5.4.
Minor Signs. Any number of minor signs are permitted in addition to all other signs permitted under this ordinance. In residential zoned areas, these signs must be no more than one sq. ft. in area, and no more than four feet in height. In B-2, I-1, and I-2 zoned areas, these signs must be no more than four sq. ft. in area, and no more than four feet in height. However, the area of all such sign faces on a single lot, parcel, residence, development, business or property may not exceed ten square feet in residential and 20 square feet in highway commercial, industrial, or heavy industrial zoned areas.
8-5.5.
Internal Signs. Any sign not visible from the outside of a structure or to passing members of the public is not restricted or regulated by this ordinance.
8-5.6.

All signs must comply with all side and rear setbacks of the underlying zoning ordinance.
(c)
Signs can be located in front setback areas, but all signs and sign structures,(in excess of four feet in height from natural grade shall have a minimum clearance of ten feet above natural grade before beginning of copy area in order to maximize traffic safety). No portion of a sign or sign structure shall encroach on or overhang the public right-of-way or any other person's property.
(d)
Distances are measured from the closest portion of the sign (whether that is the base, sign face, or the sign structure) to the right-of-way, curb or pavement.
(e)
The height requirements of a sign shall be computed as the length of a straight vertical line from normal grade to the height of the highest attached component of the sign or sign structure. When the sign is constructed within 15 feet of a right-of-way, the normal grade shall be considered the elevation of the crown of the road. When a sign is constructed 15 or more feet from any right-of-way, normal grade shall be considered the lower of (1) existing grade of the site of the sign prior to construction of the sign or (2) the newly established grade at the base of the sign after construction, exclusive of any filling, beaming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. Refer to the Table of Standard Permitted Signs for specific height limits and requirements.

8-6.5.
Calculation of Area. The area of a sign is calculated by determining the area of the smallest square or rectangle which encloses the sign face and the structure surrounding the sign face.

Unusual Shaped Signs. Unusual shaped sign are signs that are any shape other than a square or rectangle, and include signs with projecting elements or features, round, oval, and triangular signs, signs with more than four sides, signs in the shape of an animal, object, or device, and so forth.

(8)
Signs are not permitted to cover or obscure architectural features of a building.
(9)
Consider the layout and shape of the architectural features of the building when determining the size and location of a sign.
(10)
Design elements such as window patterns (vertical and horizontal rectangles, arches, squares, etc.) will help determine the sign shape that will suit the building.
(11)
All signs are to be maintained properly such that they are always in clean, working donation and the copy is not obscured or damaged.

The size of signs shall be in proportion to the size of their location.
(3)
Repetitious signage information on the same building frontage should be avoided regardless of the sign area square frontage allowed in the zoning code.

To minimize irreversible damage to masonry, all mounting and supports should be inserted into mortar joints and not into the face of the masonry. This technique does not damage the surface and allows for easy removal.
