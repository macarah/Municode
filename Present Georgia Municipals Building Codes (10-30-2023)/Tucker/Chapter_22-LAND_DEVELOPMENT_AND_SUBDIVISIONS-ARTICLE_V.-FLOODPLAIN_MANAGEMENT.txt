Editor's note— The article pertaining to floodplain management has been renumbered from article IV to article V, at the discretion of the editor, to restore numerical sequence.

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 22-604. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas.
(c)
Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize damage to private property;
(3)
Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and
(4)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
(d)
Article IX, section II of the Georgia Constitution and of the O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does ordain this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.
(Ord. No. 2016-07-20, att. (14-407), 9-1-2016)
Sec. 22-605. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(5)
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and
(6)
Protect and improve the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

Secs. 22-619—22-641. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - DEFINITIONS

Sec. 22-642. - Specific definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Accessory use means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a firewall or is separated by an independent perimeter load-bearing wall shall be considered new construction.
Adjacent to the future-conditions floodplain means all those areas located lower in elevation than either three feet above the base flood elevation or one foot above the future-conditions flood elevation, whichever is higher, unless the area has absolutely no connection to the flooding source such as through pipes, sewer laterals, down drains, foundation drains, ground seepage, overland flow, gated or valved pipes, excavated and backfilled trenches, etc., with no fill or other manmade barriers creating the separation.
Adversely affects means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.

Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Area of special flood hazard. See Special flood hazard area.
Base flood means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). The term "base flood" used throughout this division. It is equivalent to the term "intermediate regional floodplain" (IRF), previously used in the city.
Base flood elevation means the highest water surface elevation anticipated at any given point during the base flood.
Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade i.e., below ground level on all sides.
Basin means a region or land area drained by a single river system.

Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
Director means the community development director or designee.
Elevated building means a nonbasement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event.
Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
Existing construction means, for flood insurance rating purposes, any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before May 15, 1980 (the initial flood insurance rate map date).
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before July 11, 2016.
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Flood, flooding, or floodwater means:
(1)
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and
(2)
The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.
Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards.
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
Flood insurance study (FIS) means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See Flooding.
Floodplain coordinator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.
Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.
Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents (refer to FEMA technical bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93).
Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot, also referred to as the "regulatory floodway".
Floodway fringe is the area of the special flood hazard area on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.
Fraud and victimization as related to division 5 of this article, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the mayor and city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purposes unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term "functionally dependent use" includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and do not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.
Future-conditions flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year based on future-conditions hydrology. Also known as the 100-year future-conditions flood.
Future-conditions flood elevation means the flood standard equal to or higher than the base flood elevation. The future-conditions flood elevation is defined as the highest water surface anticipated at any given point during the future-conditions flood.
Future-conditions floodplain means any land susceptible to flooding by the future-conditions flood.
Future-conditions hydrology means the flood discharges associated with projected land-use conditions based on a community's zoning map, comprehensive land-use plans, and/or watershed study projections, and without consideration of projected future construction of flood detention structures or projected future hydraulic modifications, within a stream or other waterway, such as a bridge or culvert construction, fill and excavation.
Hardship, as related to division 5 of this article, means the exceptional hardship that could result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The mayor and city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
Historic structure means any structure that is:
(1)
Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

Increased costs of compliance coverage means the National Flood Insurance Program coverage used to mitigate repetitive flood loss properties, where the cumulative flood damage over a ten-year period is such that the cost of repairing the damage is more than half of the building's fair market value.
Intermediate regional flood (IRF) means a 100-year frequency flood as defined on the flood hazard map which has a probability of occurring once every 100 years or having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeding in any given year, also known as the base flood, or 100-year flood.
Land development means any land change, including, but not limited to, clearing, digging, grubbing, stripping, removal of vegetation, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land, construction, paving, and any other installation of impervious cover.
Land development activities means those actions or activities that comprise or facilitate a result in land development.
Land development project means a specific land development undertaking.
Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

The term "manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle.
Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) or land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this division, the term "mean sea level" is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) and/or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988.
Minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this division.
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929, means the vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within a floodplain.
New construction, for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the start of construction commenced after July 11, 2016, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For the purposes of determining insurance rates, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced after May 15, 1980 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
Repetitive loss structure means a building covered by a contract for flood insurance that has incurred flood-related damages on two occasions during a ten-year period ending on the date of the event for which a second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event.

The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab for footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally aboveground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means:
(1)
The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or
(2)
In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
The term "substantial improvement" includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads when the cost of such repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this division which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this division.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this division. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this division is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot;
(2)
Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity;
(3)
Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or
(4)
Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation.
(b)
Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under subsection (a) of this section shall also meet the following conditions:
(1)
Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average groundwater table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average groundwater table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel;
(2)
Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent;
(3)
Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased;

Sec. 22-697. - Floodways.
(a)
Definition of floodway boundaries.
(1)
The width of a floodway shall be determined from the flood insurance study or FEMA-approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the floodplain coordinator. If floodway data is not available from the floodplain coordinator, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the floodplain coordinator.
(2)
Following a pre-design conference with the floodplain coordinator, the boundaries or limits of the floodway shall be shown on the development or stormwater site plan containing existing topographic information.
(b)
Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as a regulatory "floodway" (see definition). A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) below.
(2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and,
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the city.

DIVISION 5. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES

Sec. 22-736. - Nature of variance.
The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this division. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the city, or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated hereinabove.
(1)
Requests for variances from the requirements of this division shall be submitted to the city. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(2)
Any person adversely affected by any decision of the city shall have the right to appeal such decision to the zoning board of appeals as established by city in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the zoning board of appeals. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(3)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board of appeals may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(4)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(5)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(6)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(7)
In reviewing such requests, the city and zoning board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this division.
(8)
Conditions for variances:
a.
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
1.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
2.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
3.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
b.
The provisions of this division are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
c.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
d.
The director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(9)
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the city and zoning board of appeals shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.
(10)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this division, the city and the zoning board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this division.
(11)
Variances shall not be issued after the fact.
(Ord. No. 2016-07-20, att. (14-446), 9-1-2016)

(a)
In passing upon requests for variances, the zoning board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this division, including all of the following:
(1)
Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
(2)
Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3)
Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effects of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
(5)
Necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where applicable;
(6)
Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7)
Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(8)
Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
(9)
Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(10)
Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
(11)
Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
(b)
Any owner to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice from the zoning board of appeals that:
(1)
The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance; and
(2)
Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain coordinator in the office of the clerk of superior court of the city in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
