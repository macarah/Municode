(b)
The governing authority of the city finds that nuisances are such activities and conditions that cause a demonstrable adverse impact on the community. These activities and conditions may be associated with illegal criminal activity that has also been proven to have a demonstrable adverse impact on community residences and results in neighborhood blight.

The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizens to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the city in enacting this chapter are as follows:
(1)
To state that it is the duty of the owner of every dwelling, building, structure, or property within the jurisdiction of this city to construct and maintain such dwelling, building, structure, or property in conformance with applicable codes in force within the jurisdiction, or such ordinances which regulate and prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain any dwelling, building, structure, or property in violation of such codes or ordinances;
(2)
To preserve the value of property and prevent neighborhood blight that arises from poorly maintained property;
(3)
To maintain and promote an attractive residential area and commercial area by requiring that dilapidated or unsafe property be repaired or removed;
(4)
To maintain for the city's residents, workers and visitors an aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interest of the city;
(5)
To protect the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the city by the removal of both criminal perpetrators and the housing blight on the community;
(6)
To require owners of real property to keep their property in compliance with building, safety and fire codes to minimize the occurrence of illegal criminal activity therein;
(7)
To promote the safety of its citizens, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public areas, to attract tourists, settlers and industry, to serve the public health, safety and aesthetics, to advance the general prosperity of the community and to serve the general welfare; and
(8)
To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
