By enacting this ordinance, the mayor and council intend to:
(1)
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
Protect the public health, safety and welfare;
(3)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(4)
Promote economic development;
(5)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(6)
Promote the use of signs which are compatible with their surroundings and consistent with the city's commitment to protecting the natural environment; and
(7)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
