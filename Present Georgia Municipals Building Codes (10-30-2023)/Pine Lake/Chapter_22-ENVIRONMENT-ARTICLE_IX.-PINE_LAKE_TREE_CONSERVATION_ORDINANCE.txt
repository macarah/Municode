a.
The purpose of this ordinance is to recognize the importance of trees to the environment within the City of Pine Lake for the purposes of health and welfare, beauty, safety, history, and general well-being, and to promote: (1) tree conservation, (2) the increase, renewal, and proliferation of trees and the tree canopy, and (3) the protection of existing trees. This ordinance is designed to provide reasonable minimum standards regarding the preservation, planting, protection and maintenance of trees within the City. The provisions and regulations contained herein, along with the Administrative Standards and Best Management Practices for Pine Lake's Urban Forest, will guide practices to accomplish said purpose.
b.
The City of Pine Lake further recognizes benefits derived from the conservation, proliferation, and renewal of trees and increased canopy including but not limited to:
i.
The improvement of air quality by providing filtration of dust and fumes;
ii.
The conservation of energy and mitigation of the urban heat island effect through shading and transpiration;
iii.
The reduction of storm water runoff and flooding by dissipating rainfall and absorbing moisture;
iv.
The reduction of soil erosion and improved water quality;
v.
The improvement of habitat for desirable wildlife by providing diversity for food, shelter, and nesting sites;
vi.
The reduction of health risks to residents due to improved environmental conditions;
vii.
The improvement of community aesthetics and quality of life by having a diverse environment;
viii.
The reduction of ambient noise levels;
ix.
The mitigation of conditions in areas of vehicular use by providing buffering and shading; and
x.
The general enhancement of economic value to properties.
c.
The requirement of a high level of quality in the maintenance and development of land is consistent with community standards and the economic necessity of maintaining Pine Lake as a desirable place to live and conduct business.
