ARTICLE 11. - SPECIAL USE PERMITS

Sec. 11-1. - Nature of special use permits; mayor and council's authority.
A.
A special use permit is a means by which the mayor and council may give special consideration, pursuant to a set of standards and criteria, to those types of uses which may or may not be compatible with uses and structures authorized as of right within a particular zoning district. Special use permits are required for uses that have operational characteristics and/or impacts that are significantly different from the zoning district's principal authorized uses and therefore require individual review pursuant to the standards and criteria set forth in this ordinance.
B.
Special use permit applications shall be authorized only for those uses specifically listed in the applicable zoning district regulations as permitted by special use permit. Uses of land or structures that are not otherwise permitted under the zoning district cannot be lawfully permitted through any special permit approval process, even though such uses, and structures may be permitted in districts other than the district in which the subject use or structure is located. Further, any characteristic of a use or characteristic of a structure, such as size, location, function, or other characteristic, which is not otherwise permitted, cannot be lawfully permitted through any special use permit approval, even though such characteristic of use or structure may be permitted in districts other than the district in which the subject use or structure is located.
C.
An applicant desiring to apply for a special use permit shall file an application with the city on forms provided for that purpose. The mayor and council, following recommendation by the zoning official, shall determine whether the proposed use, in the particular location contemplated, meets the standards and criteria set forth in this article.
Sec. 11-2. - Initiation of applications.
Special use permit applications may be initiated upon application by the owner of the subject property or by the authorized agent of the owner. Before deciding on any special use permit pursuant to the requirements set forth in this ordinance, the mayor and council shall provide for public notice and a public hearing thereon.
