ARTICLE V. - MEDIA PRODUCTIONS

Sec. 38-81. - Purpose.
(a)
It is the public policy of the State of Georgia to market the state as a location for media productions, recognizing the economic impact this industry provides, as well as the tourism it generates for local jurisdictions, such as the City of Pine Lake. The city is fortunate to have a diverse character and natural resources attractive to movie and television productions in the city.
(b)
Despite the many positive benefits a media production may offer, certain inconveniences may result if the production company and city cannot work in concert to assure minimum standards are met and to assure a thoroughly planned production schedule is followed. These concerns are best addressed through a regulatory permit.
(Ord. No. 03-2016, § 1, 12-12-2016)
Sec. 38-82. - Scope of coverage.
The permit required by this chapter shall be required for all movies, television or video series, pilots, feature films and documentaries, commercials, music videos, infomercials and public service announcements, whether the final product is intended for commercial use or not, unless the activity shall wholly occur on private property within an otherwise licensed facility (such as a film or television studio). Still photography shall by subject to the requirements of the permit required by this chapter when such photography results in obstruction of one or more streets, use of heavy equipment or use of public facilities in a manner that public access to those facilities is impaired. Any media production on public property, intended to be closed to participation by the public, or restricting access to public property or facilities normally accessible by the public, shall require a permit. For purposes of this chapter, media production activity shall include areas designated for parking of trucks and equipment on public or private property, base camps used during the production activity, and food service areas. No public highway, street or road shall have its public access restricted or limited except by a permit issued pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. No. 03-2016, § 1, 12-12-2016)
Sec. 38-83. - Permit requirements; application and procedure.
(a)
No media productions shall occur in the city without a permit therefor first having been obtained. The permit required by this chapter is allowed with conditions in all zoning districts. Whenever a permit is sought for activities in primarily residential neighborhoods, extra consideration shall be given to the conditions imposed to ameliorate as much as possible inconvenience to city residents.
(b)
Two classifications of media production permits are allowed:
(1)
Low-impact activities are generally those activities having an intended duration of no more than 14 consecutive days, with little or no disruption to normal and customary use of the site and adjacent and nearby properties and uses; and
(2)
High-impact activities are generally those activities having an intended duration of 15 or more consecutive days, and which otherwise do not comply with the low-impact standards of this chapter, and/or activities of any duration that will likely disrupt normal and customary use of the site and adjacent and nearby properties and uses. Any filming involving automobile crashes or chases, gunfire, pyrotechnics, explosives, the use of aircraft, stunts, and similar activities are examples of high-impact activities.
(c)
All applications shall be made in writing on forms provided by the city. Applications shall be submitted in duplicate originals. No application shall be deemed accepted unless accompanied by payment of the requisite application fee in US funds.
(d)
Every application shall state the name and contact information of a responsible representative of the applicant, who shall be available at all times during actual production activity within the city and for a period of not less than one year thereafter. More than one point of contact may be specified.
(e)
The application shall contain a detailed narrative of the scope of production activities, and include drawings, maps or plats to illustrate locations, property boundaries, existing material improvements, planned temporary improvements, curb cuts and driveways, adjoining streets, traffic patterns, and similar information helpful to assess the impact of the proposed activity.
(f)
When activity is to occur in or near residential areas, personal notice of intent to secure a permit and the place, date and time of the proposed media activity shall be provided by the applicant, within five days of filing the application. To the extent feasible, written acknowledgment of the notice shall be obtained from the resident or resident's agent. For purposes of the section, all residential properties within 500 feet of the outside boundaries of the location where production activity is to occur shall be notified.
(g)
A signed indemnification and hold harmless agreement, in a form acceptable to the city attorney, shall accompany the application, together with a certificate of insurance naming the city as an additional insured. The minimum limits of insurance coverage shall not be less than $1 million per occurrence.
(h)
All applications shall be filed with the city administrator, or her designee, who may require such additional information as needed to assess the proposed extent and intensity of the production within the city.
(i)
All applications shall be approved with specific terms and conditions, or denied, by the city administrator, or her designee, in writing. If approved, the city shall issue a permit to the applicant, in writing, with all terms and conditions clearly set forth therein. Low-impact activity applications shall be approved or denied within 10 business days of a complete application, and high-impact activity applications shall be approved or denied within 20 business days of a complete application. If the application is denied, the city Administrator, or her designee, shall state, in writing, the reasons for denial. An aggrieved applicant may appeal to the Mayor and city council at the next regular meeting occurring more than five (5) days following receipt of a written denial.
(j)
Permits may be denied, in whole or in part, due to prior scheduled events or activities sanctioned or permitted by the city under other provisions of this code. In addition to denial of permits not meeting standards of this chapter, the city reserves the right to deny any permit that it deems detrimental to the peace or security of residents of the city.
(k)
Any material variation from the approved scope of work permitted shall be grounds for permit revocation, unless the permit is modified in advance by the permittee.
(Ord. No. 03-2016, § 1, 12-12-2016)
Sec. 38-84. - General standards for all media productions.
The following standards apply to all media productions permitted by the city:
(1)
