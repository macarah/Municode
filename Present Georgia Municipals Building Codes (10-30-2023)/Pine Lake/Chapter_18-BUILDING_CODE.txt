Sec. 18-5. - Building permits and certificates of occupancy.
(a)
No new construction, or renovations shall be made without first obtaining a building permit from the city and second, by obtaining a permit from the county development department. The city clerk will issue permits for all new construction or renovations, only after approval and signature of the mayor or the mayors' duly assigned agent using the requirements listed below. Upon completion, no person shall occupy a new construction or renovation without first obtaining an occupancy permit from the city and, second, by obtaining an additional and final occupancy permit from the county development department. The city clerk shall issue occupancy permits from the city, only after the approval and signature of the mayor or the mayors duly assigned agent. The county development department shall not issue a building permit or an occupancy permit until the city has first issued a building permit or occupancy permit. No building permit or occupancy permit shall be issued by the city unless all building ordinances as adopted by the city and the county have been fully complied with.
(b)
The following regulations apply to both new construction and renovations:
(1)
The basic building permit fee is $100.00 plus an administration fee, calculated as follows:
a.
For replacing, improving, modifying or increasing buildings that are currently being taxed, the administration fee will be calculated as 0.4 percent of the good faith estimated costs of renovation.
b.
For new buildings, the administration fee will be calculated as 0.8 percent of sold price. Said construction will require a $1,000.00 deposit per unit before construction and the balance due to the city or to the developer will be reconciled upon closing.
c.
Upon approval of all final inspections, a certificate of occupancy will be issued for a fee of $75.00. Occupancy of any new or renovated structure without a certificate is prohibited.
(2)
All applications for building permits must include the following:
a.
To-scale site plan showing dimensions of all side boundaries and major trees six inches and over in diameter that will be removed and showing all setbacks and proposed construction; plus existing and proposed structures.
b.
1.
All new business construction will include pedestrian access via sidewalks or approved trails. All builders will provide pedestrian trails in accordance with accessibility requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968.
2.
Sidewalks or trails will interconnect businesses.
3.
Sidewalks or trails will be a minimum of 60 inches wide, will be at a grade less than eight degrees except where prohibited by topography, and will not include turns with a radius less than four feet.
4.
Sidewalks or trails will allow access to the street in at least one place along the property line.
c.
1.
All new construction along the corridors zoned as professional or commercial business will include proper curbing to separate the pedestrian areas from vehicular traffic.
2.
Curbing will be constructed along the roadway and may include an entrance lane arc.
3.
Curbing may be constructed by concrete or stone.
4.
Curbing will be a minimum of four inches wide and six inches above road bed.
d.
Silt control and drainage plan. Silt control and drainage measures will be in place prior to construction and maintained throughout project. On completion of project, lawn must be sodded, seeded or have other means of ground cover for erosion prevention; and
e.
A signed waiver that builder is responsible for all damage to city property such as curbing, sidewalks and streets and shall be repaired to the original state.
(3)
All county inspections must be made and approved by the county.
(4)
Upon completion of construction a city certificate of occupancy is required after all of the above requirements have been met. No occupancy is allowed prior to the issuance of this certificate.
(5)
Enforcement of regulations. The city administrator or his/her designee will inspect the property three times during the course of the project. First inspection prior to construction to verify accuracy of site plan, second visit prior to permanent installation of foundation, and third prior to issuance of city certificate of occupancy to ensure that construction is as per planned. The city administrator or designee is empowered to issue citations for violations of the above regulations. Failure to institute immediate corrective measures will result in work stoppage and citations for repeated infractions.
(6)
Stormwater run-off.
a.
All builders will minimize the long-term impact of stormwater run-off produced as a result of their construction. This section applies to all new construction and does not replace subsection (b)(3)d of this section.
b.
The effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived was June 9, 2003.
c.
New construction will not intentionally divert untreated stormwater from parking areas onto the street.
d.
Construction plans will yield less than one gallon (or 0.1556 cubic feet) of surface water runoff according to engineering calculations for a peak rain event of six inches (0.5 feet) per hour. Builders will calculate the stormwater impact of all proposed new construction. The calculation will take into account the impermeability of engineered surface areas as well as the water retainability of natural and engineered retention features. The net stormwater impact is the volume of runoff water calculated by subtraction the lot's ability to absorb water by the stormwater produced by a building or paving (covering), given as:
New stormwater = (lot's ability to absorb) - (construction's stormwater production)
e.
The construction's stormwater impact will be calculated by multiplying the area of each covered portion by the associated impermeability factors by a rain rate of 0.51 feet an hour. Then, subtract from that subtotal the number of gallons credited for those features which absorb or retain water.
f.
Proposed calculations will assume the following:
1.
Each 6,000 square foot plot will be credited with the ability to retain 2,571 gallons of water;
2.
Each tree less than 12 inches in width (at breast height) provides a credit of ten gallon per inch. Each tree thicker than 12 inches provides a credit of 20 gallons per inch;
3.
Horizontally projected roofline (shadow) will create 3.21 gallons per square foot;
4.
Concrete or asphalt surfaces will create 2.89 gallons per square foot;
5.
Crush-and-run gravel will create 0.640 gallons per square foot;
6.
Brick, stone or concrete pavers will create 0.963 gallons per square foot;
7.
Uncovered wooden decks with spaces greater than 0.5 inches will not produce stormwater; decks of other materials and with spaces smaller that 0.5 inches will create 0.640 to 0.963 gallons per square foot;
8.
Water features (like ponds) will be credited with 16.05 gallons per square foot;
9.
Earthen swales with large rocks will be credited with 2.25 gallons per cubic foot;
10.
Drywells or concrete stormwater retention ponds will provide a credit of 6.42 gallons per cubic foot.
g.
Calculations will be done by addressing each subtotal as illustrated in the following example:
EXPAND
Gallons
(1) Single 6,000 square foot lot -2,571
(2) 6 trees at 4 inches (×-10) plus 5 trees at 6 inches (x-10) -480
(3) 3 trees at 24 inches (×-20) -1,440
(4) 1,250 square foot building (× 3.21) 4,013
(5) 3,000 square foot stone paver parking lot (× 0.963) 2,889
(6) 150.1 square foot water feature (× 16.06) -2,410
Total 1
  (7)
This section is constructed to minimize floodplain impact of stormwater by requiring design measures to retain and pretreat stormwater on site prior to its impact to city and county lakes and streams.
a.
All builders will minimize the impact of their construction on and to the floodplains of the city. This section applies to all new construction and does not replace subsection (b)(3)d of this section and is intended to enhance subsection (b)(7) of this section.
b.
New construction will not intentionally divert untreated stormwater from parking areas into the creeks and streams.
c.
The stormwater makeup requirements will be doubled: That is, the builders will have to create twice the stormwater credits proposed in subsection (b)(7) of this section to make up for the amount of water displaced. Therefore, builders will calculate the stormwater impact of all proposed new construction as follows: Net stormwater plus a lots ability to absorb minus construction stormwater productions equals two. Therefore, the specific values outlined in subsection (b)(7) of this section that provide a credit in the lot-specific folding calculation, will only provide half the credit for those developments in the floodplain.
1.
Example inside the floodplain:
(i)
Single 6,000 square foot lot: -1,285.8 gallons.
(ii)
Six trees at four inches (×10) plus four trees at six inches (×-10): -240 gallons.
2.
Example outside the floodplain:
(i)
Single 6,000 square foot lot: -2,571 gallons.
(ii)
Six trees at four inches (×10) plus four inches at six inches (×10): -480 gallons.
(8)
Penalties.
a.
For the first infraction: stoppage of further work until the infraction is corrected.
b.
For any additional infractions: stoppage of further work until the infraction is corrected and a citation to the court is issued.

Editor's note— These references were internal footnotes appearing in the text of the following subsections. For the purposes of clarity, the footnotes were relocated to this editorial note and may be referenced to their original location by the section number that appears following the relevant information. [FN1—18-5(b)e] The values listed in this ordinance reflect the ability of each feature to transmit or absorb water and further adjusted to reflect aesthetic characteristics of the feature (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(e)). [FN2—18-5(b)f.1] A property is assumed to absorb the runoff of an 800 square foot house (800 square foot x 0.5 ft/hr= 400 cubic feet = 2571 gallons)(Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)1). [FN3—18-5(b)f.2] Trees are measured at breast height (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)2). [FN4—18-5(b)f.3] Roofs have an impermeability factor of 1.0 and each 1 square feet of roof creates 0.5 cubic feet of water (1 square foot x 0.5/ feet per hour = 0.5 cubic foot (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)3). [FN5—18-5(b)f.4] Consideration to reduce this factor will be given for innovative means to create means to allow for water to percolate into the soil (as with discontinuous paving) (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)4). [FN6—18-5(b)f.4] Paved surfaces have an impermeability factor of 0.9 (or 90% of that of the roof) (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)4). [FN7—18-5(b)f.5] Grave; surfaces have an impermeability factor of 0.2 (or 20% of that of the roof) (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)5). [FN8—18-5(b)f.6] Other materials will be assigned a value by the city of agent thereof within a range of 0.8-0.4 (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)6). [FN9—18-5(b)f.6] These materials are assigned an impermeability factor of 0.3 (30% of that of the roof) (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)6). [FN10—18-5(b)f.8] Theses features are assigned an impermeability factor of -2.5 (a credit) (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)8). [FN11—18-5(b)f.9] These features are assigned an impermeability factor of -0.7 (a credit) (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)9). [FN12—18-5(b)f.10] These features are assigned an impermeability factor of -1.0 ( a credit of volume equal to its holding capacity). The property does not have the capacity to absorb as much water as those properties well above the floodplain (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)10).
Sec. 18-6. - Inspection authority.
(a)
