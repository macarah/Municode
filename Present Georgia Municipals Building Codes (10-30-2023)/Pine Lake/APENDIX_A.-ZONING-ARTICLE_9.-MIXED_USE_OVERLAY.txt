ARTICLE 9. - MIXED USE OVERLAY

Sec. 9-1. - Purpose of the mixed-use overlay.
The Mixed-Use Overlay is established to advance the following purposes:
A.
Promote a vibrant, sustainable sense of place driven by new construction, and/or by conversion of single purpose commercial buildings, and comprised of attached dwellings, nearby consumer goods and services, offices, employment and public open space in a compact, walkable setting.
B.
Accommodate mixed use development featuring medium density residential development above or to the rear of ground floor retail, service and office uses.
C.
Encourage creation and preservation of functional open space as a gathering venue for cultural events of interest to residents, area employees and visitors.
D.
Expand the range of consumer goods offered in creative, attractive commercial environments and promote a range of housing options.
E.
Introduce flexibility in development approvals through a building and site plan process that invites creative approaches by design professionals in the architecture and arrangement of buildings and open space.
F.
Foster pedestrian travel and a diminished presence of automobiles.
Sec. 9-2. - Administration of a mixed-use overlay.
A.
A Mixed-Use Overlay shall only be established in conjunction with a site plan approved by the mayor and council. Establishment of a Mixed-Use overlay shall be a property rezoning, subject to the procedures and standards found in Article 13, Amendments as well as on the following additional considerations:
1.
Impact on the use or development of surrounding properties as concerns the public health, safety or welfare.
2.
Compatibility with surrounding uses and development as concerns the character and scale of the proposed development;
3.
Suitability of the property for the proposed use;
4.
Capacity of the lot to accommodate the use and meet the dimensional requirements of the ordinance;
5.
Impact on traffic movement and access to the property;
6.
Availability of off-street parking and opportunities for shared parking;
7.
Potential of the development to foster a pedestrian setting;
8.
Adequacy of proposed buffering, when adjoining single family uses;
9.
Effect on the watershed;
10.
Impact on the natural environment; and
11.
Hours and manner of operation.
B.
The boundaries of each Mixed-Use Overlay shall be as shown on the Pine Lake Official Zoning Map and shall correspond to the approved site plan for the overlay.
C.
Minor modifications to a Mixed-Use Overlay site plan may be approved administratively by the zoning official provided the modifications do not change the character or intensity of approved uses; the location or height of buildings, or other significant site features, including, but not limited to, blocks, streets and public open space. Minor modifications to the site plan may be approved by the zoning official only upon a finding that the following conditions are met:
1.
Such proposed modifications to blocks, streets or public open space are consistent with the purposes of the underlying zoning district(s) and the approved site plan,
2.
The proposed blocks, streets and public open space provide equal or improved vehicle and pedestrian access and open space options, and
3.
Total public open space is maintained.
Any other modification to a Mixed-Use Overlay site plan may only be approved by the mayor and council following a hearing noticed and held in accordance with the zoning procedures law and at which public input is considered.
D.
The Mixed-Use Overlay shall be the controlling ordinance for all mixed-use properties, unless otherwise provided. Any subdivision, recombination or other re-platting of lots in a Mixed-Use Overlay shall conform to the approved site plan.
E.
No minimum lot size shall apply to a mixed-use project or development provided the proposal is consistent with the current Pine Lake Comprehensive Plan and the purposes and spirit of the Mixed-Use Overlay are furthered.
Sec. 9-3. - Application of mixed-use overlay regulations.
A.
No permit for building construction or site improvements shall be issued unless the proposed building or site improvement complies with these regulations.
B.
For the purposes of this section, where two or more properties, lots or parcels are located within the same block or where two or more properties, lots or parcels have frontage on the same side of the street and are adjoining, and such properties, lots or parcels are under common ownership or control or are being developed in a single development phase or a series of coordinated development phases, such properties, lots or parcels shall be considered a single property.
C.
Prior to issuance of any building permit in a Mixed-Use Overlay, the zoning official shall certify in writing that the proposed development for which such building permit is sought is consistent with all applicable requirements of the overlay, including the approved site plan.
Sec. 9-4. - Application process.
A.
A pre-application conference shall be held by the Zoning Official for the purpose of reviewing the application process and requirements of the Mixed-Use Overlay prior to submittal of an application for assignment of a Mixed-Use Overlay. Discussion of the projected mixed-use project design and its relationship to the standards of this article shall form a portion of those discussions.
B.
Following the pre-application conference, ten copies of the site plan, elevation drawings of each building facade and landscape plan shall be submitted, as applicable, and shall be reviewed for compliance with the Mixed-Use Overlay requirements by the zoning official.
C.
All exterior demolition, new construction (including building additions), expansions of outdoor dining areas or any construction that results in increased lot coverage or modification of the building footprint shall be subject to the pre-application conference and submittal requirements. Routine repair and maintenance and interior improvements are not subject to the pre-application conference provided they involve no change of use. For example, a proposal involving conversion of a retail store to a restaurant would require a pre-application conference to determine impact on such facilities as restrooms and parking.
Sec. 9-5. - Mixed use overlay site plan.
A.
Development Description. A Mixed-Use Overlay site plan shall describe the proposed development and convey a sense of the mass, scale and extent of the development. The site plan shall depict the location of blocks and streets, building relationships and arrangement and public open space to be provided in complying with the requirements of the Mixed-Use Overlay. The Mixed-Use Overlay site plan is critical to ensuring that the purposes of the Mixed-Use Overlay are advanced relative to the street, pedestrian and open space network.
B.
Documentation. All site plans shall clearly delineate proposed streets and public open space and corresponding dimensions. A written description of each plan element shall be provided. A site sketch shall be acceptable for the purposes of the pre-application conference prior to the official submittal of a Mixed-Use Overlay site plan. Documentation shall be provided as follows:
1.
Blocks and Streets. Street documentation shall include the corresponding street classification of each street; the dimensions of the street right-of-way, lane widths, curb-to-curb widths, sidewalk clear zone widths, street furnishings and supplemental zone widths and block dimensions.
