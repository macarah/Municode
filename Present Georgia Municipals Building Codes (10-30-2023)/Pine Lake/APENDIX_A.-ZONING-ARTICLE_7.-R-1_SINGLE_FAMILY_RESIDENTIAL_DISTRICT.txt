Preserve the architectural traditions and history of Pine Lake as a camp-like retreat nestled in the woods, with century-old trees, natural landscapes, diverse and creative residential designs, and modestly-sized cottage-type dwellings, while incorporating them into a dynamic, progressive 21 st century community.
B.
Sustain and enhance the affordability of dwellings for people of all occupations, incomes, ages and lifestyles.

F.
Promote effective solutions for reducing energy and water consumption and improving the quality of storm water runoff.
G.
Reinforce the safety of residents through dwelling design and placement that provide "eyes on the street," allowing each resident to become a watchful presence, and through other practices that promote crime prevention through environmental design.
H.
Foster social interaction among neighbors and their friendly engagement in community events and activities, through thoughtful planning and design of public streets, "walkability," open space and public facilities.
I.

B.
Any legal, nonconforming structure that existed prior to Feb 13, 2017 requiring repairs involving more than 50 percent of the floor area, or that otherwise would be considered new construction, may, subject to approval by the Mayor and Council, rebuild the nonconforming structure on the same footprint as the pre-existing structure, notwithstanding applicable lot coverage and setback requirements.

No other location is reasonably available that would be less visually intrusive, and which would permit the proper functioning of the device without an increase in height.
4.
The increased height, as viewed from a public space or the street, is harmonious with the desired character and height of dwellings on the street within the same block.
Sec. 7-8. - Parking, driveways and access.
Standards of the R-1 District feature a diminished role of the automobile by controlling placement of garages and location of on-site parking. These standards also recognize the compact nature of the community and individual lots that render existing access to such lots limited. The following standards apply to parking, driveways and other lot access:
A.
No requirements for parking, drives, walks or other access shall be construed as to prevent enforcement of accessibility measures.
B.
Driveway and parking space length: Minimum driveway length shall be 20 feet measured from the right-of-way. The minimum length for off-street parking spaces shall be 20 feet.

In the case of a curved drive, this dimension may be reduced to two feet from common property boundary at any point along the curve. Side-by-side driveways or off-street parking on adjacent lots shall be separated by a continuous landscaped area having a minimum horizontal dimension of three feet.
F.
A continuous landscaped area having a minimum horizontal dimension of three feet shall be provided between driveways and parking areas and any principal dwelling or accessory structure, with the exception of entrances to an attached garage.
G.
No residential lot shall have more than one curb cut per street frontage and circular driveways are prohibited.
H.
Notwithstanding the standards of this section, any off-street parking or driveway in existence as of the date of adoption of this ordinance that fails to meet the standards of this article shall be deemed legally, nonconforming and may be allowed to continue, though not be expanded in violation of this ordinance, unless such off-street parking or driveway is deemed to be a threat to motorist or pedestrian safety.
I.
Grass and/or exposed soil shall not be a permitted parking surface. Off-street parking facilities shall be asphalt, concrete or permeable pavement. The use of pavers, pervious concrete, decorative gravel or systems such as "Grasscrete" that effectively prevent soil erosion are permitted.

Supports for carports shall be placed in footings meeting building code standards for support of the roofs weight. Supports and footing shall be arranged in such manner that all vertical supports are perpendicular and square to the ground and result in the roof of the carport being level on all four sides.
K.
The use of pea gravel and pervious pavers is encouraged for walkway and drainage way applications where topographic conditions permit as an alternative to asphalt or concrete. However, an asphalt or concrete course must be installed at the public right-of-way to preclude transfer of such walkway materials onto the public right-of-way where such walkway connects directly to the public street.

Such clear vision area shall be uniformly distributed throughout the entire fence enclosing a front yard. Such clear vision area shall be achieved through separation of portions of the fence from other portions of the fence, leaving such clear areas uncovered by any material.
E.
The finished side of any two-sided fence shall face the street, lake, park, trail, or other adjacent property.
F.
Chain link, barbed wire, razor wire, hog wire, chicken wire and similar fencing elements are prohibited materials for fences in the city; provided that chicken wire may be used to contain composting areas, vegetable gardens, and poultry and small livestock areas where such areas are allowed.

Poured concrete foundations must be painted, stained or faced with a city approved material. Standard, unfinished concrete block must be covered or coated with cement or faced with the alternative city approved material.
Sec. 7-11. - Limitations on construction on a concrete slab.
A.
No new dwelling shall be constructed on a concrete slab.
B.
With the exception of expansion of an accessory dwelling that meets all other accessory dwelling unit requirements of this ordinance, construction of dwelling unit additions on a concrete slab shall be allowed only when all of the following criteria are met:
1.
The proposed concrete slab construction expands the interior footprint of an existing concrete slab dwelling.
2.
Topographic conditions prevent expansion of the existing building footprint on a raised foundation without providing steps up or down from the existing interior rooms to proposed interior rooms.
3.
The proposed construction complies with all other district requirements, including but not limited to, height, size, location, materials and access.
4.
The proposed construction cannot be reasonably accomplished at another location on the property that would allow for increased foundation at the same finish floor elevation of existing structure.

A flipped elevation may not be located closer than three dwellings to a dwelling upon which the original elevation exists.
B.
Front façade entry point. A primary front entrance to the principal dwelling is required, which must be either from a front façade entry, or from a side entry area that is within five (5) feet of the front façade and is a minimum width of four (4) feet. An inviting entrance to the dwelling must be a prominent design feature that is clearly defined by means of a porch, portico, covered stoop, trellis, archway, flanking light posts, landscaping or other means that emphasize the entry.

Such equipment shall be screened so as not to be visible from the street.
D.
Building façade requirements. When applying any building façade requirement, each side of the building will be considered a separate façade face and will be calculated independently of the other façades. In the case of a round, curvilinear, or polygon building, the building will be divided equally into either three or four façades, the front façade face being a building elevation seen from the street. On a corner lot, the front façade shall be the façade having the primary building entrance.
E.
Varying building façade planes. To minimize the perceived visual bulk of a long or flat building façade, the plane of each façade must be varied every 30 feet or less by a projecting bay, an inserted or projecting porch, a façade that is stepped forward or back by a depth of 12 inches or more, or by utilizing similar architectural treatments that visually break up the plane of the façade.

The front yard for new dwellings on a corner lot or a through lot shall be that street frontage on which the property is addressed. A change in orientation of the front entry door on any corner lot or through lot to another street shall require approval by the Mayor and Council.
C.
Raised granite curbs shall be installed at the street edge adjacent to the property on which a new dwelling is to be erected at the sole expense of the property owner.
