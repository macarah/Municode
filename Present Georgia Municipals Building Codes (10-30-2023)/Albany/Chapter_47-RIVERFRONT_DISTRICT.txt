Cross reference— Riverfront District restrictions, § 38-303.

Sec. 47-1. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of the Riverfront District is to support and enhance Downtown Albany as the cultural and historic crown of the city, with a focus on the Flint River as its most sparking jewel. The elements of the Riverfront District must influence the shape and scope of a new, updated and redefined Downtown/Riverfront Master Plan. The district is bounded by, and includes properties along both sides of, the following demarcation lines or streets: Broadway/Radium Springs Road to the East, Mercer Alley to the South, Jefferson Street to the West and Residence Alley to North, approximately .81 square mile.
The Riverfront District is intended to establish a pedestrian-oriented, high-density, cultural and tourism district within downtown; providing an environment where individuals and families can live, work, play and discover. Emphasis will be on establishing a regional center for commerce and tourism with a mix of cultural, entertainment, retail, office, institutional, and residential uses that reflect Albany's rich local history and culture.
