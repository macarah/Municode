Sec. 38-127. - Graffiti.
(a)
Purpose and intent. The board of commissioners of the city finds and determines that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Graffiti promotes blight in the neighborhoods in which it occurs and encourages similar acts of vandalism. Without prompt and immediate removal of graffiti, other properties become the target of graffiti and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city and its citizens. The board of commissioners of the city, in the interest of public health, safety and welfare further finds and declares that to be truly effective in the deterrence, eradication and removal of graffiti, it is necessary to implement a comprehensive anti-graffiti ordinance.
(b)
The definition of "graffiti" in O.C.G.A. § 17-15A-2, as may be hereinafter amended is adopted and specifically incorporated: Any inscriptions, words, figures, paintings, or other defacements that are written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn, painted, or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any surface of real property or improvements thereon without prior authorization of the owner or occupant of the property by means of any aerosol paint container, broad-tipped marker, gum label, paint stick, graffiti stick, etching equipment, brush, or other device capable of scarring or leaving a visible mark on any surface.
(c)
Prohibited acts. It shall be unlawful for any person(s) to deface, destroy or otherwise damage private or public property without the owner's consent by or through the application of "graffiti".
(d)
Graffiti penalty. Any person who is convicted of violating subsection (c) above shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding $500.00 or by imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both. In addition to such punishment, the court may, in imposing sentence, order the defendant to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed.
(e)
Notice of removal. The property owner, manager or agent, whether the property is privately or publicly owned, is obligated to remove any graffiti from the property within a five-day of notice. Whenever the city becomes aware of the existence of graffiti on any property, including structures or improvements, a police officer or code enforcement officer shall give or cause to be given, a five-day notice to the property owner and/or owner's agent or manager to remove such graffiti. Such notice shall be in writing and have substantially the following form:
