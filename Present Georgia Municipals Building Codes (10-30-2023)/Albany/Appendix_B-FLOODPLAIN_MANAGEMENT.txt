Amendments to this ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note to this ordinance indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors in this ordinance have been corrected without notation. The same system of capitalization and expression of numbers in text has been used in this ordinance as it appears in the Code of Ordinances. Additions made to this ordinance for clarity, such as consistent state statute citations and catchline modifications, are indicated by brackets.   In addition, Ord. 09-117, adopted April 28, 2009, approved and adopted the Albany Dougherty Flood Hazard Mitigation Plan. The Plan is not set out at length herein and is on file and available for inspection in the office of the city clerk.

ARTICLE 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

Section A. - Authorization.
Article IX, section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated [O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a)] have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and board of commissioners of Albany, Georgia, does ordain as follows:
Section B. - Findings of fact.
1.
The flood hazard areas of the City of Albany are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
2.
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Section C. - Statement of purpose.
It is the intent of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
1.
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
2.
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3.
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
4.
Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and;
5.
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
Section D. - Objectives.
The objectives of this ordinance are:
1.
To protect human life and health;
2.
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
3.
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4.
To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5.
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located in floodplains;
6.
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
7.
To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area, and;
8.
To insure that flood insurance will continue to be available to the residents of Albany.

A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
a.
The overflow of inland waters; and
b.
The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.
2.
The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm or force of nature, such as a flash flood, or by some similarly unusual event which results in flooding as defined in (a) above.
Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM): An official map of a community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood areas have been defined as zone A.

New construction: means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after August 15, 1977 [the effective date of the initial FIRM] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after August 9, 1977 [the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
New manufactured home park or subdivision: means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after August 9, 1977 [the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community].
Non-conforming floodway use: any residential, commercial, industrial, office institutional, or public building located within the floodway on the date of the adoption of these regulations, and which would not be permitted to be constructed within the floodway after the first date (August 9, 1977 in the City of Albany) of the adoption of this ordinance. Any use of land within a floodway existing on the first date of the adoption of this ordinance, and which will not be permitted as a new use within the floodway.
Non-conforming floodway fringe use: any structure that is located within the floodway fringe on the first date of the adoption of this ordinance and that does not meet standards for finished floor elevations and/or flood-proofing that apply to new construction in the floodway fringe. For example, the finished floor elevation of a single family residence might be three feet below the 100 year flood elevation; such a residence should be defined as a non-conforming floodway fringe use.
Person: any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association or any other organized group of persons, including state and local governments and agencies thereof.
Recreation vehicle: means a vehicle that is:
a.
Built on a single chassis;

Regulatory flood elevation: the crest elevation in relation to mean sea level expected to be reached by the regulatory flood at any given point in an area of special flood hazard.
Start of construction: means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure: a walled and roofed building that is principally above the ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home. The term includes a building while in the course of construction, alteration or repair. The term does not include building materials or supplies intended for use in construction, alteration or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed building on the premises. The words "building" and "structure" shall have the same meaning for the purposes of this ordinance.
Substantial damage: damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvements: Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, alteration, or other improvement to a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed.
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the building official and/or code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions: is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance: A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of these regulations, as provided in Article 4, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement of this ordinance would result in exceptional hardship.
Violation: means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Section A. - General.
The floodplain within the City of Albany is hereby divided into three separate areas — the floodway, the floodway fringe, and other floodplain areas.
Section B. - Floodway.
1.
Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to the floodway as shown on the official flood maps.
2.
Restrictions governing development in floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in article 3, section B, are areas designated as floodway. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge;
b.
If article 6, section B(2)(a) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article 5.
c.
Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured home (mobile home) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of article 5, section A(2), and the elevation standards of article 5, section B(1) and the encroachment standards of article 6, section B(2)(a) are met.
3.
Permitted uses. The following and other similar uses normally have a low flood damage potential. These uses are permitted within the floodway provided that they are not prohibited by the Albany-Dougherty County Zoning Ordinance or by any other ordinance, and provided that they do not require fill, dumping of materials or waste, or storage of materials or equipment. No use shall be permitted which acting along or in combination with existing or reasonably foreseeable future uses would result in an increase in the regulatory flood elevation in accordance with article 6, section B(2)(a).
a.
Agricultural uses, including general farming, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, truck gardening, forestry, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting.
b.
Non-structural industrial and commercial uses, including golf courses, tennis courts, driving range, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, game farms, fish hatcheries, shooting preserves, target ranges, trap and skeet ranges, hunting and fishing areas, hiking and horseback riding rails.
4.
Special uses. The following uses may be permitted only upon application to the department of planning and development services and the issuance of a special use permit by the board of review as provided in article 4 of this ordinance, and provided the applicant demonstrates (by technical analysis) that he/she is in compliance with the provisions of article 6, section B(2)(a); that the use will not cause any increase in the regulatory flood level, and further provided that such uses are permitted at the proposed location by the Albany-Dougherty Zoning Ordinance:
a.
Uses accessory to permitted or special uses;
b.
Circuses, carnivals and similar transient amusement or entertainment;
c.
Drive-in theaters, lots for the sale of new and used cars, trucks, farm equipment, campers and mobile homes;

h.
Other uses which the board of review considers to be similar in nature to those listed elsewhere in this section; and
i.
A single family dwelling or a manufactured home may be constructed on a lot that was on record in the office of the clerk of the Superior Court of Dougherty County, Georgia on the effective date of the first adoption of this ordinance if the lowest floor of that dwelling is at least one foot above the 100 year flood elevation. The method used to raise the structure must not increase the regulatory flood elevation, or obstruct the carrying capacity of the floodway in accordance with article 6, section B(2)(a).
5.
Signs to identify floodway. Wherever the floodway boundary crosses a public road, a sign shall be placed by the City of Albany identifying property located on the river side of the sign as lying within the floodway.
Section C. - Floodway fringe.
1.
Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply to all areas designated as the floodway fringe on the official flood maps.
2.
Subdivision development in the floodway fringe. The plat of each subdivision that is developed in the floodway fringe after the effective date when this ordinance was first adopted shall contain a notation clearly stating the water surface elevation of the 100-year flood in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD).
Section D. - Other floodplain areas.
Standards for streams without established base flood elevation and/or floodways:
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in article 3, section B, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base flood has been provided without floodways, the following provisions shall apply:
1.
No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
2.
New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with article 4, section C(1).
(a)
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.
3.
Where base flood data has been provided but without floodways delineated, new construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall have lowest floor elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation.
Areas of non-stream related flooding:
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in article 3, section B, are isolated areas designated as unnumbered A-zones on the FIRM maps. These areas may have special flood hazards where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where localized ponding occurs; therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
1.
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated, at least one foot above the base flood elevation established by the city engineer.
2.
All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential buildings shall:
a.
Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation established by the city engineer.
b.
Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely flood-proofed to our above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
ARTICLE 7. - FLOOD-PROOFING

Section A. - Minimum flood-proofing requirements.
