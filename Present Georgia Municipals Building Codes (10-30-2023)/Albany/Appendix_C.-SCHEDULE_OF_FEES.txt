Example: A department store (Retail) would fall into the profitability class #2 on the NAICS Profitability List, so they would select the tax rate of .000475 from the Occupation Tax Schedule. The calculation would be:
Gross receipts of $1,500,000 X .000475 = $ 712.50 Amount Due.
Definition of Gross receipts: Gross receipts means total revenue of the business or practitioner for the period, including without being limited to, the following:
(i)
Total income without deduction for the cost of goods sold or expenses incurred;
(ii)
Gain from trading in stocks, bonds, capital assets, or instruments of indebtedness;
(iii)
Proceeds from commissions on the sale of property, goods, or services;
(iv)
Proceeds from fees charged for services rendered; and
(v)
