Chapter 54 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
ARTICLE I. - STORMWATER UTILITY

Sec. 54-1. - Findings of fact.
In support of establishment of a stormwater utility, the mayor and board of commissioners makes the following findings of fact:
(a)
The City of Albany is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I and III thereof and O.C.G.A. ยง 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the City of Albany (hereinafter "the city" or "Albany").
(b)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, Albany is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its city charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal, a system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas.
(c)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff may:
(1)
Cause erosion of lands; threaten businesses, residences, and other facilities with water damage; and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams, and other bodies of water within, and downstream of, the city.
(2)
Adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the City of Albany thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system.
(3)
Contribute to the potential degradation of the quality of both surface water and groundwater resources.
(d)
The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for implementation of its comprehensive stormwater management program and drainage-related capital improvement needs.
(e)
The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. the Federal Clean Water Act, the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (hereinafter "NPDES") Phase II Stormwater Permit] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater user fee charge upon improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4, or receive stormwater services from the city, either directly or indirectly, whether or not the property is private or public in nature.
(f)
Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the city's NPDES phase II stormwater permit, the city's wastewater treatment permits, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and the other applicable regulatory programs will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for stormwater management program implementation, water quality management, drainage system maintenance, floodplain management, capital construction and other program activities.
(g)
The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and the funding of necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the city's stormwater management program.
(h)
The due diligence work, financial analysis and related documents prepared by the city's stormwater consultant properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and operational costs as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy.
(i)
Given the stormwater management program's needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs.
(j)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the City of Albany is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(k)
The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management to improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management program which results in services being provided to such properties. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the user fee charge correlates to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the city's stormwater management program.
(l)
The stormwater management needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, businesses, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways even though the benefits may be indirect or immeasurable.
(m)
A stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to implement an enhanced level of service for stormwater management service delivery within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms.
(n)
The amount of impervious surface on each improved property is the most important factor influencing stormwater runoff characteristics and these characteristics bear a rational nexus to the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city, or to be provided by the city in the future, to that property. As a result, the amount of impervious surface on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge.
(o)
A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Stormwater utility user fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity, as well as customer understanding of the user fee charge rate structure, while at the same time minimizing the city's customer account management and maintenance efforts.
(p)
Stormwater utility user fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city commission.
(q)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site stormwater control facilities, activities or assets which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the impact of a particular property on the city's stormwater management program, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or a credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property.
(r)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, systems or facilities, together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and supplemental revenues shall therefore be deposited into the City of Albany Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes in accordance with applicable sections of the aforementioned master trust indenture.
(s)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of the City of Albany hereby exercises its authority to establish stormwater utility user fee charge rates for the provision of stormwater management services.

(Ord. No. 13-133, ยง 1, 11-26-2013)
Sec. 54-6. - Stormwater user fee charges.
(a)
It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service area shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services by the city.
(b)
The basis for calculation of the stormwater user fee charge to developed property within the city is established in this article. The city shall assign or determine the customer class, amount of impervious area and other pertinent factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the costs to deliver stormwater management services and to calculate the stormwater user fee charges for developed properties in the city.
(c)
Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a reasonable connection, or rational nexus, to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city as defined herein.
(d)
To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which mitigate, or compensate for, the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities, or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities.
(e)
The stormwater user fee charges shall accrue beginning April 1, 2014.
(Ord. No. 13-133, ยง 1, 11-26-2013)
Sec. 54-7. - Stormwater utility customer classes.
(a)
The stormwater utility shall establish specified customer classes within the service area to reflect differences in impervious surface and stormwater runoff characteristics; stormwater management program services provided by the city to the customers; and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city stormwater management program and drainage system components. Publically owned, developed properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties, unless otherwise exempted. The stormwater utility classes will encompass developed and undeveloped properties within the city and are defined as follows:
(1)
Single family residential (SFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as SFR customers per the applicable definition.
(2)
The non-single family residential (NSFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as NSFR customers per the applicable definition.
(3)
The undeveloped class shall consist of properties classified as undeveloped per the applicable definition.
(b)
Documentation pertaining to the stormwater utility customer classes shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater utility manager for public inspection.
(Ord. No. 13-133, ยง 1, 11-26-2013)
Sec. 54-8. - Stormwater utility user fee charge rates.
(a)
The stormwater utility shall impose a stormwater user fee on developed properties within the service area in a fair and equitable manner. The stormwater utility shall apportion the cost of delivering stormwater services to developed properties based on the demand the property places on the city's stormwater management program, the stormwater services provided by the city to that property and the benefits derived.
(b)
The stormwater user fee rate is initially set at $2.50 per ERU. Stormwater user fees shall annually increase by the Consumer Price Index over the prior 12 month period. As used herein, the term "Consumer Price Index" is the Consumer Price Index published by the United States Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), 1982-1984 +100. If the Consumer Price Index ceases to incorporate a significant number of items now incorporated therein, or if a substantial change is made in the method of establishing the Consumer Price Index, then the Consumer Price Index will be replaced with a reasonable substitute. Additionally, the billing rates may be modified by the mayor and city commission from time to time to meet the financial and operational needs of the Albany Stormwater Utility. A current schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk for public inspection.
(c)
In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the mayor and city commission to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable, and which, together with other funding sources available to the City of Albany Stormwater Utility for services, systems, and/or facilities related to stormwater management are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management program, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other stormwater utility related costs as deemed appropriate by the city.
(d)
Stormwater user fee charges shall be based upon the total number of equivalent residential units (ERUs) associated with developed properties within the city. Each ERU shall correspond to 2,700 square feet of impervious surface.
(e)
Gravel and compacted soil associated with driveways, parking areas, roads and other areas that consist of these type surface (or near surface) conditions on developed property will be designated as impervious surface and included in the customer's ERU calculation because of the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. The total surface area associated with these materials will be calculated at 85 percent of the total ERUs to reflect the hydrologic response characteristics and limited infiltration capabilities of partial impervious surface materials.
(f)
Calculation of stormwater user fee charges. The periodic stormwater user fee charges imposed on developed properties shall be calculated by multiplying the stormwater user fee billing rate times the number of ERUs for each customer account. The number of ERUs that will be utilized to calculate the user fee charge for each customer account shall be in general accordance with the following:
(1)
SFR customer class: Each SFR customer account shall be charged a flat rate of 1.0 ERU except as noted below.
a.
If a SFR customer account consists of more than 8,100 square feet of impervious surface (or 3.0 ERUs), the customer account for that parcel will be charged as per the NSFR calculation described herein.
(2)
NSFR customer class: Each NSFR customer shall be charged 1.0 ERU for each 2,700 square feet, or increment thereof, of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs will be rounded to one decimal place to establish the total number of ERUs for billing.
(3)
Undeveloped land customer class: Undeveloped land shall not be charged a stormwater user fee.
