Sec. 22-3. - Appellate review.
The orders, verdicts, judgments, and sentences of the court shall be subject to appellate review by writ of certiorari in the appropriate the county superior court or as otherwise provided by general state law.
(1)
Any person who has been convicted of any criminal or quasi-criminal offense or violation of any ordinance, in any inferior judicatory by whatever name called, who desires a writ of certiorari to review and correct the judgment of conviction in the case shall be entitled to a supersedeas of the judgment, if such person or his or her attorney files with the clerk of the court the proper papers, and, a bond payable to the municipality, in amount and with security acceptable to, and to be approved by the clerk of court, or chief judge as a condition that the defendant will personally appear and abide the final judgment, order, or sentence upon such person in the case.
(2)
All bonds must be paid to the city treasury department. The bond may be forfeited in the same manner as any other criminal or civil bond in any other court having jurisdiction. A bond may be forfeited according to the procedure prescribed in any of the municipal ordinances, or any provision of this chapter, or any state law granted to local municipalities. Alternatively, an action may be brought on the bond in any court having jurisdiction. Upon the giving of a bond the defendant shall be released from custody in the same manner as defendants are released upon supersedeas bonds in criminal cases where a notice of appeal has been filed.
(3)
If the defendant is unable because of his or her indigence to make bond and makes this fact known by affidavit to be filed with the judge or clerk of court, as the case may be, the same shall operate as a supersedeas of the judgment; provided, however, that the defendant shall not be set at liberty unless the defendant gives a bond as prescribed in subsections (a) and/or (b) of this section.
(4)
The supersedeas provided for in this section shall operate to suspend the judgment of conviction until the case is finally heard, and determined in the county superior court, to which it is taken by certiorari, or by the court of appeals upon appeal, provided that within the time prescribed by law the defendant shall apply for and procure the writ and remedies provided by law for reviewing the judgment complained of. The supersedeas shall be equally applicable whether the judge of the county superior court to whom the petition for certiorari is presented sanctions it or refuses it, provided that within the time provided by law the defendant diligently files a notice of appeal.
(5)
The object of this section is to provide a method by which a defendant may obtain a supersedeas so long as the defendent is prosecuting or is entitled under the law to prosecute the proceeding brought or to be brought to review the conviction of which he or she is complaining, or any intermediate appellate judgment rendered thereon, in order that the defendant shall not be deprived of his or her right to apply to the courts by being compelled to serve his or her sentence or pay a fine before he or she has had the full opportunity allowed him or her by law of taking the necessary appeal under certiorari.

(3)

(5)
Selection of judge.
