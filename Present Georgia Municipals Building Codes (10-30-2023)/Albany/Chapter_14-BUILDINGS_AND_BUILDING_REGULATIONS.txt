The same is adopted and incorporated as fully as if set out at length herein, and from the date on which this section shall take effect, the provisions thereof shall be controlling within the corporate limits of the city and the unincorporated areas of Dougherty County, Georgia.
(c)

(Ord. No. 08-118, § 3(8-39), 6-25-2008)
Sec. 14-3. - References to officials in adopted technical codes.
Where reference is made to the duties of certain officials named within the technical codes which are adopted by reference in this chapter, then that designated official of the city, who has duties corresponding to those of the named official in said technical code, shall be deemed to be the responsible official insofar as enforcing the provisions of that technical code are concerned.
Sec. 14-4. - Permitting process; building permits and administration of construction codes.
(a)
All applications for building permits, grading plans, land disturbance permits will be made to the inspection department. Only two complete sets of plans will be submitted at this time. No other department will accept these type of plans.
(b)
On Tuesday and Thursday of each week staff of the inspection, engineering, environmental health, planning and water, gas, and light departments will meet to review all plans submitted since the previous meeting. These plans will be reviewed to determine if all required information has been submitted, not that the plans meet all codes. If the plans are complete the applicant will be notified and the appropriate number of plans will be submitted to inspection. If the plans are incomplete the applicant will be notified in writing with every specific deficiency noted. When corrected the plans will be resubmitted and the process will begin again.
(c)
After certification that plans are complete and the appropriate number of sets of plans are submitted to the inspection department only, the inspection department will route plans to the departments whose review is required. Those departments will have the number of days as listed in the developers handbook to complete their review. All approved plans will be submitted to the inspection department by the various departments and a permit will be issued. If there are deficiencies in the plans the reviewing department will notify the inspection department in writing as soon as possible, but not wait until the end of the review period. The inspection department will then notify the applicant in writing of the needed corrections. When all items have been corrected permits will be issued.
(d)
All progress and final inspections will be coordinated through the inspection department. Applicants/contractors will call inspection and a log will be made of each type of inspection requested. At the end of each day inspection will fax a list of all scheduled inspections to the appropriate department. When all final inspections have been completed a certificate of occupancy will be issued. To make this work correctly several points are important.
(1)
Plans will no longer be accepted for review at any department other than inspection. This will insure that the review is coordinated and maintained. Additionally, all fees will be paid at the inspection department.
(2)
Should a department have a question regarding something in the plan, it will be possible for that department to contact the applicant/engineer to resolve the question.
(3)
The inspection department will monitor all of the review process. On a weekly basis the city manager will be provided a report on the status of all project reviews.
(e)
The fees for the reinspections, review of plans, subsequent reviews, additional plan review, and building permits shall be as established by the board of city commissioners, from time to time, and are available for public examination in the offices of planning and development, the city clerk, and are listed in the fee schedule.
