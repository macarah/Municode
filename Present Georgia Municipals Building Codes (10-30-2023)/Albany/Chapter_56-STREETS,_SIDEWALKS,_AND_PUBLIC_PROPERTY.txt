DIVISION 4. - ADDRESS NUMBERING

Sec. 56-102. - Administration and issuance by planning and development services department.
(a)
The planning and development services department shall be the agency with exclusive overall administration and coordination responsibility to administer these guidelines following initial implementation.
(b)
Street addresses shall be issued by the planning and development services department for all parcels and principle dwellings and buildings located on all officially mapped public and private roads.
(c)
Addresses will be provided only on those roads that have been assigned a name in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this article.
(Ord. No. 09-110, § 1(4.01), 2-24-2009)
Sec. 56-103. - Address numbering system.
(a)
Generally.
(1)
The addressing system is based on a baseline/meridian structure. The county is divided into four quadrants based on the intersection of Broad Avenue and the Flint River. (See appendix A to this article)
(2)
Block ranges are well established for the city and the county and form a relatively evenly spaced grid. Where possible, one address number shall be established for each 20-foot (+/-) interval. Addresses are assigned based on the driveway entrance, not the front of the structure.
(3)
Even numbers shall be on the southerly sides of roads and odd numbers shall be on the northerly sides of roads.
(4)
Even numbers shall be on the easterly sides of roads and odd numbers shall be on the westerly sides of roads.
(5)
Roads which are not traveling due north-south/east-west or that meander shall be numbered as a north-south/east-west road if the major portion of the road within the county runs north-south/east-west. Once a north-south/east-west road has an address number assigned to structures, then that road shall always be considered to be a north-south/east-west road.
(6)
Address numbers south of the baseline shall be affixed with the prefix "south," and address numbers north of the baseline shall be affixed with the prefix "north" to avoid duplication of address numbers. The above also applies to east and west streets.
(b)
Fractional, alphanumeric, and hyphenated addresses. There shall be no use of fractional addresses, alphanumeric address numbers or hyphenated address numbers. This also applies to apartment numbers and suite numbers.
(c)
Component order. Components of a street address shall always be in the following order: address number, directional prefix (if any), street name and street type, designation of apartment or suite, and apartment/suite number.
(d)
Diagonal streets. Diagonal streets shall be treated as either north-south or east-west streets. Once orientation is established, it shall be used throughout the entire length of the road. The orientation will not change even if the road changes direction. Within developments, it is advisable to consider the direction of the beginning of the road. If it originates off a north-south road and begins by going east-west before meandering north-south, it is generally considered an east-west road.
(e)
Circular streets. A circular street/road is one that returns to the same origin point or to the same originating road. Circular streets shall be numbered beginning at the low numbered intersection and continuing to the other end of the road. The outside of the circle is numbered first and the inside is then numbered mix and matched with the outside. This will result, in most cases, with fewer numbers on the inside of the circle and with larger spaces between inside numbers. The numbering sequences of the outside and inside of the circle shall be used throughout the entire length of the road.
(f)
Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall be addressed using the system based on the baseline/meridian structure, with odd/even numbers on the appropriate sides of the street and meeting at the midpoint or the back of the cul-de-sac.
(g)
Corner lots. It is preferable for corner lots to be addressed to the road that the driveway is accessed from. However, corner lots have the option of being addressed to the driveway or the front of the structure. Addresses based on the driveway shall require the mailbox to be placed at the driveway access. Addresses based on the front of the structure shall require the mailbox to be placed on the road at the front of that structure. Display of address numbers on the structure shall face the road to which the home is addressed. The assigned address will be determined by the site plan presented at the time a building permit is requested.
(h)
Private drives/easements. Private drives/easements may be addressed to an existing adjoining road when they serve no more than two lots or structures. A sign or post which clearly indicates the address numbers assigned to the structures shall be located at the entry point of the private drive/easement. Private drives and easements that serve more than two lots or structures will be addressed to the private drive/easement.
(i)
Single-family residences. A single-family residence shall receive its own individual address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction.
(j)
Duplex residences. A duplex shall be addressed with each unit receiving its own individual address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction.
(k)
Apartment residences. Apartments shall be numbered with the main building receiving one address and each individual apartment being assigned apartment numbers as secondary location indicators. The apartment number assigned should indicate floor location (e.g., apartment 204 being the fourth apartment on the second floor). Alphanumerical numbers are not to be used. Apartment buildings with multiple entrances, where each entrance provides access to a limited number of apartments, shall require an address for each individual entrance as determined by the street allowing main access to the entrance and following the basic rules for distance and direction.
(l)
Mobile home parks/manufactured home communities. Each individual mobile home or manufactured home shall be assigned its own individual address following the basic rules for distance and direction. This generally results in leaving four to eight numbers between adjacent sites.
(m)
Townhouses. Townhouses that are individually owned and not part of an apartment complex shall be assigned an individual address for each unit as determined by the street allowing main access to the building and following basic rules for distance and direction. In cases where entry is not from the street on which the townhouse is addressed (e.g., alleys or parking areas), address numbers shall be posted on both the front and rear of the structure. Townhouses that are under the apartment category will be addressed as apartments, with the main building receiving one address and each individual townhouse being assigned apartment numbers as secondary locators.
(n)
Condominiums.
(1)
Condominiums shall be assigned an individual address for each unit as determined by the street allowing main access to the building and following the basic rules for distance and direction. In cases where entry is not from the street on which the townhouse is addressed (e.g., alleys or parking areas), address numbers shall be posted on both the front and rear of the structure.
(2)
An apartment building or townhouse complex that is converted to a condominium shall be required to be addressed with an individual address for each unit.
(o)
Office buildings. Office buildings shall be numbered with the main building receiving one address and each individual office being assigned suite numbers as secondary; location indicators. The suite number assigned should indicate the floor location (e.g., suite 204 being the fourth office on the second floor). Alphanumerical numbers are not to be used. Office buildings with multiple entrances, where each entrance provides access to a limited number of offices, shall be assigned an address for each individual entrance as determined by the street allowing main access to the entrance and following the basic rules for distance and direction.
(p)
Individual commercial buildings.
(1)
Individual commercial buildings shall be given one address to the road/street on which the driveway access is located as determined by the basic rules for distance and direction. When a business faces a main road but is accessed from a secondary road, an address will be allowed to the main road if the primary entrance faces the main road. In addition to being posted on the side of the building facing the main road, this address shall be posted on the outside of the main building in a manner that is legible to the public as well as emergency responders from the point of access.
(2)
An individual building housing more than one business shall require a separate address for each unit. Suite numbers shall not be allowed.
(3)
A large retail complex/superstore that houses one main retail business with additional smaller retail spaces within (e.g., grocery store with cleaner, bank, hair salon, etc.) shall be assigned one address for the use of all businesses located within the main structure. This address shall be posted on the outside of the main building in a manner that is legible to the public as well as emergency responders.
(q)
Strip commercial buildings. Strip commercial buildings shall require an address to be reserved for each individual entry door. Careful planning shall be taken to reserve enough numbers for future divisions of businesses. Each business shall receive its own individual address. If a business is large enough to use space accessed by two or more doors, the business shall be assigned the number that corresponds to its primary entrance.
(r)
Miscellaneous structure. Outbuildings and/or utilities requiring metering that are required to have an address shall be given their own individual address, generally four to six numbers from the main residence. Outbuildings having their own access drives shall be assigned addresses following the basic rules for distance and direction.
(s)
Wireless tower. A wireless tower shall be assigned one address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction. When additional carriers are added, all carriers will be assigned a suite number with the address, including the carrier. A sign or post which clearly indicates the address numbers assigned to the tower shall be located at the entry point of the road on which the tower is located.

(1)
If the existing address number is not in sequence and does not run consecutively in the same direction as the county address system;
(2)
If the existing address number is such that assignment of address numbers for new structures is not practical and in keeping with the requirements;
