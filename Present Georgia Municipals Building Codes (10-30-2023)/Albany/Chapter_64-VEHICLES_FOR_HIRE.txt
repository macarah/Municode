Sec. 64-133. - Taximeters required.
(a)
Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Basic distance rate means the charge for distance for all intervals except the initial interval.
Basic time rate means the charge for the time for all intervals except the initial interval.
Cleared means a taximeter that is inoperative with respect to all fare when no indication of fare or extras is shown and when all parts are in those positions in which they are designed to be when the vehicle on which the taximeter is installed is not engaged by a passenger.
Cold tire pressure means the pressure in a tire when the tire is at ambient temperature.
Face means a taximeter upon which passenger charges are indicated.
Fare means that portion of the charge for the hire of a vehicle that is automatically calculated by a taximeter through the operation of the distance or time mechanism.
Fifth wheel test means a distance test similar to a road test except that the distance traveled by the vehicle under test is determined by a mechanism known as a "fifth wheel" that is attached to the vehicle and that independently measures and indicates the distance.
Flag means a plate at the end of the lever arm or similar part by which the operating condition of the taximeter is controlled.
Hired means a taximeter that is operative with respect to all applicable indications of fares or extras. The indications of fare include time and distance where applicable unless by another indication of the term "time not recording" or an equivalent expression.
Initial distance of time interval means the interval corresponding to the initial money drop.
Money drop means an increment of fare indication. The initial money drop is the first increment of fare indication following activation of the taximeter.
Multiple-tariff taximeter means one that may be set to calculate fares at any one of two or more rates.
Operating tire pressure means the pressure in a tire when the vehicle has been driven for at least five miles or eight kilometers.
Road test means a distance test, over a measured course, of a complete taximeter assembly when installed on a vehicle, the mechanism being actuate as a result of vehicle travel.
Rolling circumference means the straight-line distance traveled per revolution of the wheel that actuates the taximeter. If more than one wheel actuates the taximeter, the rolling circumference is the average distance traveled per revolution of the wheels.
Simulated road test means a distance test during which the taximeter may be actuated by some means other than road travel. The distance traveled is either measured by a properly calibrated roller device or computed from rolling circumference and wheel-turn data.
Single-tariff taximeter means one that calculates fares at a single rate only.
Subsequent distance ortime intervals means the intervals corresponding to money drops following the initial money drop.
Taximeter means any instrument or device attached to a vehicle and designed to measure mechanically or electronically the distance traveled by such vehicle, to record the times the vehicle travels or is in waiting and to indicate the fare to be charged.
(b)
All taxicabs operated under the authority of this article, which charges are determined by mileage or by the length of time the vehicle is used, shall be equipped with a taximeter. The taximeter shall be fastened in front of the passengers, visible to them at all times day and night, and, after sundown, the face of the taximeter shall be illuminated. All taximeters shall be installed, properly connected and repaired as prescribed by the manufacturer of such meter. Each taximeter shall have thereon some device, which designates when the taximeter is engaged. Any taximeter shall be subject to inspection at any time by the director, any code enforcement officer or any employee of the city police department.
(c)
Taxicabs operating with nonelectronic taximeters shall be furnished with a sign approved by the director immediately adjacent to the taximeter which explains the way the fare shall be calculated if the taximeter reaches its highest fare before the passenger's destination is reached. The sign shall be pointed out to the passenger by the driver at the beginning of the trip.
(d)
A taximeter shall be equipped with a primary indicating element.
(e)
Except when a taximeter is being cleared, the primary indicating elements shall be susceptible of advancement only by the rotation of the vehicle wheels or by the time mechanism.

(g)
When a taximeter designed to calculate fares upon the basis of a combination of distance traveled and time elapsed is operative with respect to fare indication, the fare-indicting mechanism shall be actuated by the distance mechanism whenever the vehicle is in motion at such a speed that the rate of distance revenue equals or exceeds the time rate and may be actuated by the time mechanism whenever the vehicle speed is less than this and when the vehicle is not in motion. Means shall be provided for the vehicle operator to render the time mechanism either operative or inoperative with respect to the fare-indicating mechanism.
(h)
Whenever the indicating elements of a taximeter are set to indicate a charge for the hire of the vehicle, the character of the fare indication shall be clearly shown on the taximeter face. When a taximeter is cleared, the indication "not registering," "vacant" or an equivalent expression shall be shown.
(i)
Whenever a single-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the indication "registering," "hired" or an equivalent expression shall be shown.
(j)
Whenever a multi-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the basis for the particular tariff for which it is set shall be shown.
(k)
Indications of fare shall be displayed through and entirely protected by glass or other suitable transparent material securely attached to the housing of the taximeter.
(l)
A taximeter shall calculate fares only upon the basis of distance traveled, time elapsed or a combination of distance traveled and time elapsed.
(m)
A control lever-arm knob, handle or other convenient and effective means shall be provided to set the taximeter mechanism for the desired operating condition and to clear the taximeter.
(n)
The several positions of the control level shall be mechanically defined and displacement from any of these positions shall be sufficiently obstructed that the accidental or inadvertent changing of the operating condition of the taximeter is improbable or controlled by a button or switch. Possible movement of this control lever to an operating position immediately following its movement to the cleared position shall automatically be displayed enough to permit the taximeter mechanism to come to complete rest in the cleared position.
(o)
Adequate provisions shall be made for affixing lead and wire seals to a taximeter and to other parts required for service operation of a complete installation on a vehicle so that no adjustments, alterations or replacements affecting in any way the accuracy or indications of the device or the assembly can be made without mutilating the seals. The sealing means shall be such that it is not necessary to disassemble or remove any part of the device or of the vehicle to apply or inspect the seals.
(p)
To determine compliance with distance tolerances, a distance test of a taximeter shall be conducted utilizing one or more of the following test methods:
(1)
Road test. A road test consists of driving the vehicle over a precisely measured road course.
(2)
Fifth wheel test. A fifth wheel test consists of driving the vehicle in a simulated road test; 150 pounds or 70 kilograms of test weights may be substituted in lieu of the second person.
(q)
Maintenance and acceptance tolerances for taximeters shall be as follows:
(1)
On overregistration, one percent of the interval under test.
(2)
On underregistration, four percent of the interval under test, with an added tolerance of 100 feet or 30 miles whenever the initial interval is included in the interval under test.
(r)
Maintenance and acceptance tolerances on individual time intervals shall be as follows:
(1)
On overregistration, three seconds per minute (five percent).
(2)
