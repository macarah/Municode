The election must be made not later than 20 days after the receipt by the electing person of service, the person making such election shall give notice of doing so to the director and to all other complainants and respondents to whom the charge relates.
(2)
If the director has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance or as a result of an investigation under section 30-27 finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred, at the recommendation of the director, the city attorney, after reviewing the director's findings and determining that such charge is well grounded in fact and warranted by law, shall bring an action in the name of the city on behalf of the aggrieved person seeking relief under this section in a superior court.
(3)
If an election is made under subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section, the director shall authorize and, not later than 30 days after the election is made, the city attorney, after reviewing the director's charge and determining that such charge is well grounded in fact and warranted by law, shall commence a civil action on behalf of the aggrieved person seeking relief under this section in a superior court.

(c)
Fines and damages.

Up to $10,000.00, if the respondent has not previously been found guilty of committing a discriminatory housing practice;

(3)
In addition to the remedies set forth in subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the court may award actual damages and punitive damages to the aggrieved person. Punitive damages awarded under this subsection may be awarded only when the evidence shows that the respondent's action showed willful misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of conscious indifference to consequences or to the rights of the aggrieved party.
