The council may amend the operating budget proposed by the city manager except, that the budget as finally amended and adopted must provide for all expenditures required by law or by other provisions of the Charter and for all debt service requirements for the ensuing fiscal year and the total appropriations from any fund shall not exceed the estimated fund balance, reserves and revenues, constituting the fund availability of such fund.
(b)
The council shall adopt the final operating budget for the ensuing fiscal year not later than one day prior to the beginning of each fiscal year. If the council fails to adopt the budget by said date, the amounts appropriated for operation for the current fiscal year shall be deemed adopted for the ensuing year on a month-to-month basis, with all items prorated accordingly until such time as the council adopts a budget for the ensuing fiscal year. Such adoption shall take the form of an appropriation ordinance setting out the estimated revenues in detail by sources and making appropriations according to fund and by operating department, organizational unit, purpose or activity as set out in the budget document.
(c)
The amount set out in the adopted operating budget for each operating department or organizational unit shall constitute the annual appropriation for such item, and no expenditure shall be made or encumbrance created in excess of the otherwise unencumbered balance of the appropriations, or allotment thereof, to which it is chargeable.

(Code 1969, § 2-15; Code 1981, § 9-4; Ord. of 11-18-1974)

The council shall have power to accept with or without amendments, or reject the proposed program and proposed means of financing.

(b)
The council shall adopt the final capital improvements budget for the ensuing fiscal year not later than one day prior to the beginning of each fiscal year.

(b)
The council may quitclaim any rights it may have in property not needed for public purposes upon report by the city manager and adoption of a resolution, both finding that the property is not needed for public or other purposes and that the interest of city has no readily ascertainable monetary value.
(c)
Whenever in opening, extending or widening any street, avenue, alley or public place of the city, a small parcel or tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the city, the council may authorize the city manager to execute and deliver in the name of the city a deed conveying said cutoff or separated parcel or tract of land to abutting or adjoining property owners in exchange for rights-of-way of said street, avenue, alley or public place or in settlement of any alleged damages sustained by said abutting or adjoining property owners.

Sec. 34-10. - Title contracts; local vendors; failure to meet bid specifications.
(a)
The city may utilize state contracts in lieu of issuing bids or buying locally when it is to the economic advantage of the city.
(b)
When determined by the city council that there would be a financial or operational benefit to the city as a result of less down time, faster delivery, improved routine or warranty maintenance schedule, better agent response or another best management practice that would be deemed advantageous to the city, the city council may enact a local vendor preference provision subject to the below criteria:
(1)
A local vendor is defined as a qualified provider of services and/or materials having had a city business license for at least one year prior to the bid award date and issued a current business license with a city or county business address.
(2)
The local vendor preference shall be to match the qualified, low nonlocal vendor's bid if the local vendor is:
a.
Within seven percent of $40,000.00 of the low bid.
b.
Within five percent of $75,000.00 of the low bid.
c.
Within three percent of $100,000.00 of the low bid.
(3)
The local vendor must confirm in writing within five working days of the city council's enactment of matching or exceeding the low bid price. Failure to do so will void the local bidder preference provision.
(4)
If two or more local bidders qualify for the preference, the lowest written submitted response within five working days will receive the award.
(5)
This preference shall not apply to public works bids as defined by the state.
(c)
If a bidder is determined to not meet the bid specifications it shall be immediately advised in writing of the basis for the determination by the city or the project engineer and/or administrator. Should the bidder desire to appeal this determination, it must respond in writing within seven working days of the date of the notice. This written response will be included in the bid package forwarded to the city council for review. The city council shall then decide if it wishes to consider the appeal. The city council action is final.
