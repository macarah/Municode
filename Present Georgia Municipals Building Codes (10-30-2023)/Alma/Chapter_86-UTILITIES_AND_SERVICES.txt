General criteria.
(1)
Installation requirements for new food service facilities. All proposed or newly remodeled food service facilities inside the city wastewater service area shall be required to install an approved, properly operated and maintained grease interceptor, all interceptor units shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility building unless the user can demonstrate to city that an outdoor interceptor would not be feasible. A passive interceptor inside the facility shall not be allowed. All interceptor units shall be of the type and capacity approved by the city, while under normal circumstances a 1,500-gallon outside grease interceptor will be required, under proper circumstances the code enforcement officer may authorize the installation of a fully automated inside grease interceptor.
(2)
Requirements for existing food service facilities. All existing food service facilities inside the city wastewater service area are expected to conduct their operations in such a manner that grease is captured on the user's premises and then properly disposed. Existing food service facilities will be handled under the city grease management program in the following manner:
a.
The city will periodically inspect each food service facility on an as-needed basis to assure that each facility is complying with the intent of the grease control program. The as-needed inspection shall be determined by the city.
b.
Each food service facility in the vicinity of any problem areas will be inspected. During such inspection, the city will review applicable maintenance records and will assess the adequacy of the facilities' grease control practices and grease control interceptor/equipment.
c.
Following the inspections, the city will send written notice to the inspected food service facilities, containing a summary of the policy requirements, and the results of the inspection. The inspections will typically result in one of the following actions:
1.
Facilities equipped with an appropriate and adequately sized grease interceptor which are meeting the intent of the grease management program through effective grease control practices will be commended for their compliance.
2.
After notice and an opportunity to be heard, facilities not in compliance shall be required to develop and submit to the city a proposed plan designed to achieve compliance through improved housekeeping and/or increased maintenance and periodic pumping of the existing grease interceptor/equipment.
3.
Facilities found by the city to have failed to achieve compliance with intent of the grease management program through improved housekeeping and increased maintenance and pumping of the existing grease interceptor/equipment will be required to install the necessary interceptor/equipment to bring the facility into compliance.
(3)
Prohibited discharges. Domestic wastewater shall not be discharged to the grease interceptor unless specifically approved, in writing, by the city.
(4)
Waste minimization plan. Food service facilities shall develop and implement a waste minimization plan pertaining to the disposal of grease, oils, and food particles. Educational materials are available from the city sewer department regarding the minimization of these wastes.
(5)
Floor drains. All floor drains located in the kitchen/food preparation area or floor drains within any other area which has the potential to discharge grease, must be plumbed to an outside grease interceptor. Facilities with a kitchen/food preparation area lacking floor drains are required to provide a mop sink plumbed to drain through an approved under sink or in-line grease trap.
(6)
Location. Each grease interceptor shall be installed and connected so that it is at all times easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal, [and] installed outdoors of the food service facility. The best location is in an area outside of an exterior wall, but upstream from the domestic wastewater drain line(s). A grease interceptor may not be installed inside any part of a building that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible.
(d)
Design criteria.
1.
Construction of interceptors. Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the city plumbing standards and shall meet the minimum requirements of the adopted state 2012 [International Plumbing Code] section[s] 1003—1004, interceptors, and separation codes. Outdoor units shall have a minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All alternative grease removal devices or technologies shall be subject to the written approval of the city. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed technology.
(2)

Other fixture Manufacturer peak gpm x 2
    1003.3.4.1 Grease interceptor capacity refer to table 1003.3.4.1 2012 International Plumbing Code.
Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and shall pay the costs to provide additional measures if required by the city. The city reserves the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels or grease discharge, or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the formula.
(e)
Grease interceptor maintenance.
(1)
Pumping. All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is strictly prohibited.
(2)
Pumping frequency. Outdoor grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three months. Under-sink or in-line grease interceptors must be pumped/cleaned out completely a minimum of once every month. Grease interceptors may need to be pumped more frequently as needed to prevent carryover of grease into the sanitary sewer collection system. In the discretion of the city, pumping frequency may be extended past the minimum period if the user can demonstrate that such schedule meets with the intent of this section.
(3)
Pump out order. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed city maximum discharge limits, and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 33 percent of the total depth of the trap, code enforcement will issue a pump out order to the user. The user shall have seven days from receipt of the order to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written or verbal warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply.
(4)
Disposal of interceptor pumped material. All waste removed from each grease interceptor shall be recorded on a proper manifest form. Also, all waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed at a facility approved by the city to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumped material be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer collection system.
(5)
Additives. Any additive(s) placed into the grease interceptor or building discharge line system on a constant, regular or scheduled basis shall be reported to the city. Such additives shall include, but are not limited to, commercially available bacteria or other additives designed to absorb, consume, or treat fats, oils and grease. The use of additives shall in no way be considered as an alternative technology or a substitution for maintenance procedures required herein.
(6)
Chemical treatment. Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, enzymes, acids, and other chemicals designed to dissolve purge, or remove grease shall not be allowed to enter the grease interceptor.
(f)
Administrative requirements.
(1)
Initial data acquisition. All food service facilities will be asked to complete a data sheet to establish the grease interceptor database. The city database will be updated with additional or modified information after each yearly inspection.
(2)
Administrative fees. No fee will be charged for an annual inspection by the city. However, if the user's grease interceptor is not in compliance with this section, a $75.00 reinspection fee shall be charged for each inspection thereafter until compliance is achieved.
(3)
Inspection and entry. Authorized personnel of the city, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall have the right to enter upon all properties subject to this program, at any time and without prior notification, for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, testing or record review, as part of this program.
(4)
Record retention and reporting. All users must keep a record of any cleaning or maintenance of their grease interceptor. The following records must be kept on-site at the food service facility for a period of two years:

The log shall be kept in a conspicuous location for inspection. This log shall be made immediately available to the code enforcement officer or city representative upon request.
(g)
Enforcement. The following list is arranged from least severe to most severe:
(1)
Letter of warning (LW). When the code enforcement officer finds that a user is not in compliance with any provision of this article, the coordinator will serve that user with a written warning describing the noncompliance in detail.
(2)
Notice of violation (NOV). If the noncompliance issue is not addressed by the user within a three-day period following the letter of warning, a written notice of violation will be issued. According to the severity of the violation, the user will be given up to 30 days from receipt of this notice to issue an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof to include specific required action, shall be submitted by the user to code enforcement. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the code enforcement officer to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(3)
Site visit or reinsertion (SV). Upon the receipt of plans from the user and the allotted time for corrections to be made has expired, the code enforcement officer or the employee designated by the city manager will reinspect the facility to assure all violations have been corrected.
(4)
Consent orders (CO). The code enforcement officer may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document.
(5)
Increased self-monitoring or reporting (ISM). The code enforcement officer may require monitoring devices to be installed at the facility in violation for measuring the amount of grease being released at said facility. Additional reporting of pumping frequency or other means of meeting the requirement in order to be in compliance will be required of the user.
(6)
Cease and desist order (CDO). When the code enforcement officer determines that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any other standard or requirement, the code enforcement officer has the authority to issue an order to the user directing them to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
a.
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
b.
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
(7)
Judicial enforcement remedies or litigation (summons) (LIT). Should the code enforcement officer determine that a violation has jeopardized the health and/or welfare of the public or that a violation cannot be resolved with the user administratively, the code enforcement officer may use the issuance of a summons for violation of this section. A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this Code section, or order issued hereunder, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.
(8)
Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Code section are not exclusive. The code enforcement officer may take any, all or any combination of remedial actions against a noncompliant user.
