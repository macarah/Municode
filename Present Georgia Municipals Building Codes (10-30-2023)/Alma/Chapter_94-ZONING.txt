To hear and decide applications for special exceptions of this chapter and for decision of any special questions upon which the board of appeals is authorized by this chapter to pass.
(3)
To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done.
