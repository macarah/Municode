DIVISION 7. - RATES AND CHARGES

Sec. 25-492. - Levied.
A service charge is levied and assessed for the operation and maintenance of the sewer system. This charge is based on the amount of potable water consumed per month by each contributor to the sewer system. The rate at which this charge is levied shall be as established by action of the governing authority of the sewer system provider. The charges imposed by this article may be periodically revised at the discretion of the governing authority of the sewer system provider. A readiness-to-serve charge is imposed for the operation of the sewer system based on the size of the customer's water meter. A surcharge for overstrength waste, i.e., wastes consisting of total suspended solids and/or five-day biochemical oxygen demand materials in concentrations exceeding 250 mg/l, ammonia in concentrations exceeding 30 mg/l, and total phosphorus exceeding ten mg/l, is levied at a rate approved and adopted by the board of commissioners.
