Sec. 1-10. - Altering Code.
It is unlawful for any person in the city to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with this Code in any manner except by ordinance or other official act of the mayor and council which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby.

For violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement adopted pursuant to the Federal Clean Water Act, the maximum fine shall be $1,000.00 per day for each violation by an industrial user.
(4)
With respect to violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues is a separate offense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, attorneys shall not be punished under this section for failure to comply with chapter 15.
(d)
The imposition of a fine pursuant to this section does not prevent revocation or suspension of any city issued registration, business occupation tax certificate, license, permit or franchise.
