The actual and final amount of tax levied shall be paid in accordance with the gross receipts data submitted for the succeeding calendar year. If the amount of estimated tax paid is less than the actual amount due based upon the actual gross receipts of the business for the tax year, then the difference shall be due and payable by the taxpayer on or before the deadline for payment of taxes in the succeeding year. If the estimated amount paid for a tax year exceeds the amount due based upon the actual gross receipts of the business for the tax year, then the difference shall be refunded by the county or, if the business or occupation continues to be conducted during the succeeding tax year, the overpayment for the previous year will be credited by the county against the estimated tax due for the succeeding tax year.
