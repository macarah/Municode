The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
At large means that an animal is in any public street, right-of-way, park or other public grounds, or when off the premises of the owner or person who has custody of the animal, and not under restraint or under the immediate control (at heel) of the owner or the person who has custody of the animal.
Classified dog means any dog that has been classified as either a dangerous dog or vicious dog, pursuant to this chapter. No dog shall be classified as a dangerous dog or vicious dog for actions that occur while the dog is being used by a law enforcement or military officer to carry out the law enforcement or military officer's official duties. No dog shall be classified as a dangerous dog or a vicious dog if the person injured by such dog was a person who, at the time, was committing a trespass, was abusing the dog, or was committing or attempting to commit an offense under O.C.G.A. § 16-5-1 et seq.
Court means the magistrate court of the county.
Dangerous dog means any dog that:
(1)
Causes a substantial puncture of a person's skin by teeth, without causing serious injury; provided, however, that a nip, scratch, or abrasion shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subsection;
(2)
Aggressively attacks in a manner that causes a person to reasonably believe that the dog posed an imminent threat of serious injury to such person or another person, although no such injury occurs; provided, however, that the acts of barking, growling, or showing of teeth by a dog shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subsection; or
(3)
While off the owner's property, kills a pet animal; provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply where the death of such pet animal is caused by a dog that is working or training as a hunting dog, herding dog, or predator control dog.
Dog means a canine of whatever breed, and all ages.
Dog control officer means an individual designated by the county pursuant to the provisions of section 6-135 to aid in the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
Humane manner means care of an animal to include protection from injury, adequate coolness and heat, ventilation, sanitary shelter, and wholesome food and water which are consistent with the normal requirements and breeding habits of the animal's size, species, and breed.
Kennel means an establishment kept for the purpose of breeding, selling, or boarding animals, or by those engaged in training animals.
Nuisance . An animal shall be considered a nuisance if it damages, defiles, or defecates on private property, public walks and recreational areas (unless such waste is immediately removed and properly disposed of by the animal's owner), or causes an unsanitary, dangerous, or offensive condition, or causes a disturbance by excessive barking or other noisemaking, or chases vehicles, or molests, attacks or interferes with persons or other domestic animals on public property.
Owner means any natural person or any legal entity, including, but not limited to, a corporation, partnership, firm or trust, owning, possessing, harboring, keeping, or having custody or control of an animal within the county. In the case of a dog owned by a minor, the term "owner" includes the parents or person in loco parentis with custody of the minor.
Proper enclosure means an enclosure for keeping a dangerous dog or vicious dog while on the owner's property securely confined indoors or in a securely enclosed and locked pen, fence, or structure suitable to prevent the entry of young children, and designed to prevent the dog from escaping. Any such pen or structure shall have secure sides and a secure top, and, if the dog is enclosed within a fence, shall be of sufficient height, and the bottom of the fence shall be constructed or secured in such a manner as to prevent the dog's escape either from over or from under the fence. Any such enclosure shall also provide protection from the elements for the dog.
Serious injury means any physical injury that creates a substantial risk of death, results in death, broken or dislocated bones, lacerations requiring multiple sutures, or disfiguring avulsions, requires plastic surgery or admission to a hospital, or results in protracted impairment of health, including transmission of an infection or contagious disease, or impairment of the function of any bodily organ.
Tethered means an animal attached to a stationary object by a chain, cable or similar device commonly used for the size and type of animal involved. An animal is not considered tethered when the animal is attached to a stationary object, as long as the owner or custodian is physically within reach of the animal. Any device used to restrain an animal must be at least ten feet in length.
Under restraint means secured by a leash or lead held by an able-bodied person.
Vicious dog means a dog that inflicts serious injury on a person or causes serious injury to a person resulting from reasonable attempts to escape from the dog's attack.

Choke collars and pinch collars are prohibited for the purpose of tethering an animal to a running cable line or trolley system.
(6)
The animal is tethered at sufficient distance from any other objects to prevent the tangling of the cable by extending over an object or an edge that could result in injury or strangulation of the animal, and be of sufficient distance from any fence so as to prohibit the animal access to the fence.

(d)
Secondary means of restraint such as proper enclosures may also be engaged, such as a properly installed fence or kennel.

No person shall allow any animal or fowl over which he has custody or control to remain on his property or premises if the same shall constitute a nuisance. For purposes of this section, it shall constitute a nuisance for an animal or fowl to bark, howl, whine, or emit any noises whatsoever in a continuous manner so as to disturb any occupant of any adjoining or adjacent property within hearing distance of such property, or for a condition to result from the keeping of such animal or fowl whereby an obnoxious odor emits therefrom, detectable beyond the limits of the property of such owner or keeper.
