Sec. 18-104. - Application requirements.
Amended by Ordinance of 10-04-2022 (3)
(a)
No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county without first obtaining a permit from the county board of commissioners to perform such activity.
(b)
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the county board of commissioners and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 18-105. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of sections 18-47 and 18-48. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by six copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer, or the designee thereof, visited the site prior to creation of the plan, or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board.
(c)
A fee as published by the county board of commissioners shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area.
(d)
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit, for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development, or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(e)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 18-48(15) and (16) and bonding, if required as per subsection (g) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district.
(f)
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this division, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
(g)
The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding $3,000.00 per acre, or fraction thereof, of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond, or any part thereof, to be forfeited, and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.
