Chapter 38 - STREETS AND ROADS[1]
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 38-1—38-18. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - DRIVEWAY CULVERTS

Sec. 38-19. - Objective.
It is the objective of this article to provide for the unrestricted flow of stormwater along public roads in the county, through the proper placement of driveway culvert pipes, to benefit the health, safety, and welfare of the county residents, and the protection of private and public property.
(Ord. No. 2002-12-03, § 1, 12-3-2002)
Sec. 38-20. - Applicability.
All property owners in the county who wish to gain access to their property, whether for residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other purposes, by crossing a county-owned right-of-way, must utilize a driveway containing an appropriate-size culvert pipe as described in this article. In addition to future right-of-way crossings, this article applies to properties where existing driveways transverse the county right-of-way. Timber harvesters who wish to gain temporary access to a harvest site may utilize their own culvert pipe, subject to meeting forestry best management practices. However, this pipe must be removed and the ditch restored to its original condition following the completion of the harvesting activities.
(Ord. No. 2002-12-03, § 2(a), 12-3-2002)

(a)
Culvert pipe description. Unless otherwise specified or approved by the county road superintendent, all driveway culvert pipe shall be made of reinforced concrete, meeting state department of transportation specifications, and measure a minimum of 18 inches in diameter and 24 feet in length. At the discretion of the road superintendent, flared end sections may be required in certain cases.
(b)
Installation and maintenance of culverts. In order to ensure consistency in the quality and type of material, the property owner must purchase all driveway culvert pipe, at cost, from the county clerk. Upon purchase of the pipe, the county road department will be responsible for installing and maintaining the pipe at no additional cost to the property owner. In the event that culvert pipe is damaged by the property owner or becomes unsuitable for use as determined by the county road superintendent, the property owner is responsible for purchasing replacement pipe through the county board of commissioners. Any culvert pipe damaged as a result of right-of-way maintenance activities by the county road department will be replaced at no charge by the county.

the county road department will install driveway culvert pipe along state-maintained routes, at no cost for installation to the property owner.
