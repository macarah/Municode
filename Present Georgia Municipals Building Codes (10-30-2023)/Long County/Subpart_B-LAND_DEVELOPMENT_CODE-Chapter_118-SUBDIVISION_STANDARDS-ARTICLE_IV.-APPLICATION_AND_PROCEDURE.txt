ARTICLE IV. - APPLICATION AND PROCEDURE

Sec. 118-98. - Subdivision process.
(a)
Five-step review process. The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of five separate steps. These are:
(1)
Step 1: Review of the sketch plan by the planning board/governing authority/designee.
(2)
Step 2: Review and recommendation of the preliminary plat by the planning board.
(3)
Step 3: Review and approval of the preliminary plat by the governing authority.
(4)
Step 4: Review and approval of the proposed development plan by the governing authority or its designee.
(5)
Step 5: Review and approval of the final plat by the governing authority.
(b)
Step 1 may be, and steps 2 and 3 and 4 shall be, completed prior to making any street improvements, or installing any utilities. Step 5 shall be completed prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision. The site proposed to be subdivided must be zoned in the appropriate residential, commercial, industrial, planned development or other zoning district prior to the completion of step 2.
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.12)
Sec. 118-99. - Review procedure.
The following procedure shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats:
(1)
Sketch plan review procedures. Prior to the filing of a preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit to the code enforcement official a simple sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. The sketch plan may be a simple freehand drawing. Included with the sketch plan should be a sketch map, which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning for the preparation of the preliminary plat, and enable the subdivider to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. The code enforcement official shall coordinate for the review of the sketch plan for zoning measures and approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the sketch plan zoning within 15 days from the meeting at which it is presented. Pertinent comments and recommendations shall be noted in the minutes of the planning board meeting. The secretary shall also forward copies of the sketch plan to the governing authority for review.
(2)
Preliminary plat procedures. Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the code enforcement office at least 25 days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the planning board. The plat of the subdivision shall be submitted in six blackline or blueline prints and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained herein, as well as one electronic copy in a read-only format acceptable to the planning board. Any preliminary plat submitted to the planning board shall contain the name and address of the subdivider (or subdivider's designee) to whom a notice of hearing may be sent, and no preliminary plat shall be acted upon by the planning board without affording a hearing thereon, notice of the time and place of which shall be sent to said address not less than five days before the date of the hearing.
a.
The code enforcement official may request additional copies of the plat and supplemental information. The person or agency to which a copy of the preliminary plat is directed shall review the preliminary plat and indicate any required changes or comments on the plat and submit to the planning board prior to the formal presentation of the preliminary plat. The local governing authority shall approve the preliminary plat following action by the planning board.
b.
The code enforcement official shall examine the preliminary plat to determine if it meets all requirements of these regulations and shall place a preliminary plat on the agenda of the planning board for its action.
c.
The subdivider must provide written assurance of availability of adequate water and sewer service from a public or private provider. If water and/or sewer service is available through the City of Ludowici and/or Long County, the subdivider shall be required to obtain services through local means. If water and/or sewerage systems not connected to a municipal system are to be installed, the subdivider is to indicate who will own the system, who will operate the system, and what assurance will be given to the governing authority for continued operation.
d.
The planning and zoning board shall act on the preliminary plat within 45 days after formal submission and having received confirmation of all necessary approvals as described in subsections (2)a, b, and c of this section. Failure of the planning board to act within 45 days after formal submission of the complete preliminary plat shall be deemed to constitute approval, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning board on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. The action of the board shall be recorded in the minutes of the board meeting.
e.
The planning and zoning board shall vote to approve or disapprove the preliminary plat. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within 18 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require the preliminary plat to be resubmitted to the planning board for approval. The developer shall not initiate action to change any of the existing conditions reported on the preliminary plat as required by section 118-161 until the preliminary plat has been approved by the governing authority and a proposed development plan approved by building official or his designee.
f.
Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets, location of other required easements, and the dimensions and shapes of lots. Application for approval of the final plat will be considered only after the requirements for the final plat approval as specified herein have been fulfilled, and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the planning board and the governing authority, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat.
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.13)
Sec. 118-100. - Modification of requirements.
(a)
Modification of requirement for sketch plan review. Where the governing authority determines that the additional step of requiring submittal and review of a sketch plat is unnecessary in the case of a specific application, it may allow the applicant to submit a final plat upon approval of a preliminary plat. Care should be taken that all of the issues addressed by the sketch plat review are adequately addressed in the final plat review.
(b)
Modification of requirement for family conveyance subdivision. Where the governing authority determines that the proposed subdivision represents a division of land with the bona fide intent of transferring land to a member of the subdivider's family, it may modify requirements relative to the construction and dedication of public roads and other public improvements. The subdivider is cautioned that this does not relieve him of any obligations for access, and that consideration should be given to the future ability to develop land without adequate roads or improvements. For the purposes of this provision, a family member shall include a spouse, sibling, parent, or child of at least one owner of record of the subject property.
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, §§ 6.10, 6.10.1)
Sec. 118-101. - Sketch plans and preliminary plats not required.
Subdivisions which do not involve platting, construction or opening of new streets, new facilities or improvements to municipal, public, or community water, or sewer facilities, or improvement of existing streets, shall be accepted by the planning board in the form of a final plat. Such plat shall comply in all respects to these regulations. Sketch plans and preliminary plats are not required in such cases, but construction drawings of selected existing improvements may be required by the staff. The following exceptions are included for the purpose of authorizing that the building official may approve such subdivisions:
(1)
Family conveyance exception. When the applicant certifies to the planning board that the applicant's intended division of the land is only for conveyance to one or more family members for single-family residential or agricultural use in lands currently zoned for agricultural or agricultural and rural residential uses, the secretary of the planning board may receive the final plat as information and indicate the final plat may be recorded. The term "family member" is defined as the applicant's spouse, natural or adopted children, stepchildren, father, mother, sister, brother or grandchildren. To satisfy the requirements for a family conveyance exemption, one of the two following conditions must be met:
a.
Condition one:
1.
The division of land must be into 15 or fewer parcels, and conveyed to one or more family members;
2.
No new public streets or other public infrastructure improvements are involved; and
3.
The resulting lots are a minimum of one acre, and meet the required frontage for the zoning of the property, except when a single parcel is subdivided into two new parcels of at least one acre each. In these cases each of the two new parcels must have the maximum feasible direct frontage on an existing county or public road, but in no case shall the frontage be less than 30 feet; or
b.
Condition two:
1.
The division of land must be into 15 or fewer parcels, and conveyed to one or more family members;
2.
No new public streets, or other public infrastructure improvements, are involved;
3.
If the resultant lots are a minimum of one acre, but all lots do not have direct access that meet the required frontage for the zoning district to an existing public street or way, then the plat shall include a permanent, nonexclusive 60-foot access easement from an existing public street to all lots which do not have access with required frontage to existing public streets or ways, and are otherwise equal to the standard of the governing authority in which the division of land is being made; and
4.
All lots or parcels abutting any platted access easement following this exception shall include a disclosure that the easement or street is not a publicly maintained street, and the street shall be maintained by the owners of the property within such subdivisions, and the governing authority has no responsibility whatsoever for their maintenance and repair, until and unless improved to approved street standards and dedicated and accepted by the governing authority.
The resulting family subdivision in these cases shall be restricted from further subdivision, unless the further subdivision meets all requirements of this chapter.
(2)
Minor rural land conveyance exception. When the applicant certifies to the planning board that the applicant's intended division of the land is only for subdivision of rural lands currently zoned for agricultural (A-1) or agricultural and rural residential (R-R) uses, the secretary of the planning board may receive the final plat as information, and indicate the final plat may be recorded. The conditions required to meet the requirements for a minor rural land conveyance exemption are as follows:
a.
The land may be divided into no more than ten parcels;
b.
Minimum parcel size shall be five acres, and the minimum lot width shall be 150 feet;
c.
If all parcels do not have direct access that meet the required 150-foot frontage to an existing public street or way, then the plat shall include a permanent, non-exclusive 60-foot access easement from an existing public street to all lots which do not have access with required frontage to existing public streets or ways, and are otherwise equal to the standard of the governing authority in which the division of land is being made;
d.
The parcels that result from this exemption shall be restricted from further subdivision or extension, until all requirements of this chapter are met;
e.
The future paving of any street in the subdivision will be at the abutting property owner's expense; and
f.
In order to ensure the proper provision of emergency or other services by the county or other entities, when any dwelling units are constructed on any parcel served by the easement described in subsection (2)c of this section, no certificate of occupancy shall be given until a roadway meeting the standards contained in section 118-313 for unpaved minor streets is constructed by the property owners. All such streets or roadways shall be private streets and meet all requirements for a private street exception, other than paving.
(3)
Shared access conveyance exception for rural areas. The secretary of the planning board or building official may approve a final plat when the applicant seeks to create a minimum 30-foot wide exclusive driveway access easement to serve not more than two lots in agriculture/forestry or rural residential zoned areas. The two resulting lots shall share the common exclusive driveway access easement, and shall not be further subdivided in the future, unless the driveway easement is upgraded to the county standards for a public or private road.
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.14)

Application for approval of a final plat shall be submitted to the secretary of the planning board. A bond or letter of credit for an amount necessary to complete any remaining primary and secondary improvements shall be submitted at least ten days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the governing authority. Remaining primary improvements must be completed within six months from the date of final plat approval by the governing authority. Remaining secondary improvements must be completed within two years from the date of final plat approval by the governing authority.
(b)
Until a final plat of a subdivision has been submitted to, reviewed and approved, and signed by the planning board and governing authority, the clerk of the county superior court shall not record the plat of such subdivision, nor shall the owner or agent of such subdivision transfer title to any lot within the subdivision by reference to the subdivision plat. For large subdivisions the final plat may be submitted for approval in contiguous sections satisfactory to the governing authority.
(c)
The installation of streets, sidewalks, drainage systems, water, nonpotable reuse water lines, and sewerage systems, and other improvements shall be in compliance with the governing authority's standard specifications for materials and installation procedures on file with the planning board and the governing authority's flood regulations. The elevation of fill and the installation of streets, drainage systems, water, nonpotable reuse water lines and/or sewerage systems shall be certified by the developer's registered engineer as being in compliance with applicable requirements before approval of the final plat.
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.13.4)
Sec. 118-103. - Final approval.
Final approval of the plat shall be by the governing authority.
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.13.5)
Sec. 118-104. - Certification.

(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.13.6)
Sec. 118-105. - Federal housing administration approval.
In the event the subdivider plans to secure approval of the subdivision design by the federal housing administration, it is suggested that such approval be secured after submission to and approval of a preliminary plat by the planning board and governing authority, as well as approval of the proposed development plan by the governing authority staff.
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.15)
Sec. 118-106. - Approval of subdivision in floodprone area and developments adjacent to state waters.
Standards for floodprone area uses. All subdivisions must be designed to minimize flood damage; all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems shall be located, elevated, and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; adequate drainage must be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into the floodwaters; on-site waste disposal systems must be located so as to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during flooding. These additional standards shall also apply to floodprone areas:
(1)
Structures (temporary or permanent).
a.
All structures shall be designed consistent with all federal flood insurance standards.
b.
Structures shall have a low flood damage potential.
c.
The structure, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of floodwater.
1.
Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
2.
So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those adjoining structures.
d.
Structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation which may result in damage to other structures, restriction of bridge openings and other narrow sections of the stream or river.
e.
Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall be constructed at or above the 100-year floodplain elevation for the particular area, or be floodproofed.
(2)
Storage of material and equipment.
a.
The storage or processing of materials that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive or could be injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited.
b.
Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods, and firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, §§ 6.16.1—6.16.3)
Sec. 118-107. - Standards for areas adjacent to state waters.
All subdivisions or planned developments must be designed to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff from development that may affect the state waters as defined in the governing authority's Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance in chapter 18, article II of subpart A. Stormwater should meet the stormwater runoff quality minimum standard number 2 of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual before it is discharged. A plan for any buffers and handling of stormwater shall be included with all preliminary plats or site development plans. This plan may be included as an attachment to the proposed development plan and must be reviewed and approved by the governing authority staff.
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.16.4)
Sec. 118-108. - Resubdivision of land.
(a)
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land, and it is intended that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into small building sites, the governing authority shall require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the plat, and the code enforcement official shall determine.
(b)
Procedure for resubdivision. Whenever a developer desires to resubdivide an already approved final subdivision plat, the developer shall first obtain approval for the resubdivision by the same procedures prescribed for the subdivision of land.
(c)
Resubdivision includes:
(1)
Any change in any street layout or any other public improvement;
(2)
Any change in any lot line;
(3)
Any change in the amount of land reserved for public use or the common use of lot owners;
(4)
Any change in any easements shown on the approved plat.
(d)
Waivers. Whenever the governing authority, in its sole discretion, makes a finding on the record that the purposes of these regulations may be served by permitting resubdivision by the procedure established in this subsection, the governing authority may waive the requirement of subsection (a) of this section. The governing authority, after an application for resubdivision that includes an express request for waiver, shall publish notice of the application in a local newspaper of general circulation and shall provide personal notice to property owners in the subdivision. The notice shall include:
(1)
The name and legal description of the subdivision affected by the application;
(2)
The proposed changes in the final subdivision plat;
(3)
The place and time at which the application and any accompanying documents may be reviewed by the public;
(4)
The place and time at which written comments on the proposed resubdivision may be submitted by the public; and
(5)
The place and time of the public meeting at which the governing authority will consider whether to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the proposed resubdivision.
(e)
Procedure for subdivisions when future resubdivision is indicated. Whenever land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there is reason to believe that such lots eventually will be resubdivided, the governing authority may require that the applicant allow for the future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of streets may be made a requirement of plat approval.
