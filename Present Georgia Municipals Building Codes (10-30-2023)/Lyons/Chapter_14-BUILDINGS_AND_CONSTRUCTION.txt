Sec. 14-72. - Variances.
In those limited circumstances where the state minimum construction codes allow a local variance based upon hardship, the city council may, upon finding that strict enforcement of the state minimum standard codes would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of such codes and the public interest, grant a variance, subject to finding, in writing, all of the following:
(1)
That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure, or system involved and which are not applicable to others similarly situated;
(2)
That the special condition and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant;
(3)
That granting a variance will not confer on the applicant any special privileges that are denied by the codes to other buildings, structures, or service systems;
(4)
That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure, or service system; and
(5)
That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of such codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare.
Applications for variance shall be advertised not less than 15 days prior to conducting an evidentiary hearing before the city council. Such hearing shall be informally conducted, with the applicant having the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. Each decision of the city council shall recite the factual findings underlying its decision and the reasons for such decision. In granting a variance, the city council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the codes, including a reasonable time limit in which the variance is required to be commenced or completed, or both. A copy of the city council's written decision shall immediately be filed in its minutes of the hearing at which the variance was considered and a copy promptly served upon all affected parties.
