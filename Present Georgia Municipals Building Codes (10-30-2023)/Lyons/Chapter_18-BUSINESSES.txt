Where the remaining term of the license is less than 12 months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license.

(7)
The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested to the licensee and his attorney, with a copy to the city attorney, within ten business days of the close of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final action by the city, subject to review upon petition for certiorari to the superior court.

The maximum reasonable costs of removal, relocation, and storage pursuant to this article shall be compensatory, as such term is used in the public utility rate-making procedures, and shall be established and maintained annually by the mayor and council, by resolution, on or before January 1. No person licensed under this article to operate a towing and storage business within the city shall impose, assess or collect rates, fees and charges prohibited by this article or this state. No fees shall be allowed for the removal and storage of any motor vehicle towed or stored in violation of O.C.G.A. § 44-1-13, as amended, or O.C.G.A. § 40-11-2, as amended.
(b)
On or before November 1 of each year, any person holding a license issued under this article may file with the city manager, or his or her designee, a proposed schedule of revised rates and charges allowed by this article. Notice of the filing shall be published once a week for two weeks in "The Advance," advertising the date, time, and location of a public hearing to be held before the mayor and council. At the hearing, any affected citizen may be heard as to the proposed rate revisions. After concluding the hearing, the mayor and council shall act upon the rate request. Copies of the current rate schedule shall be posted conspicuously in each licensee's place of business and in a conspicuous location within city hall.
(c)
Where a proposed rate increase is contested, the mayor and council shall have the right to require licensees to submit financial statements, tax returns, and such other information as is needed to justify or deny the rate proposal. To the extent allowed by law, any and all officers, employees and contractors of the city, and the mayor and council, shall treat such data as confidential and proprietary information.
