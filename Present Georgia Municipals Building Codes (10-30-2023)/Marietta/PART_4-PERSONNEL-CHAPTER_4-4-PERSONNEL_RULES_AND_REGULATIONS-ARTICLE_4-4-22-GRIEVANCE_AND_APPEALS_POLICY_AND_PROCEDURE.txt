ARTICLE 4-4-22 - GRIEVANCE AND APPEALS POLICY AND PROCEDURE

4-4-22-010 - Policy.
It is the policy of the city/BLW to resolve grievances informally if at all possible. Supervisors and managers are expected to make every effort to discuss and resolve problems as they arise. However, there may be grievances or appeals of disciplinary actions which can only be resolved after a formal review. This review process is outlined below.

4-4-22-030 - Formal grievance procedure.
A.
Regular Employees Department Heads Hired Prior to February 9, 1994.
1.
If a grievance arises from the action of an official higher than the immediate supervisor, the grievance may be initiated at Step 2 or 3, as appropriate. At no time will an employee bypass a supervisor and/or department head that were involved in the grieved or appealed action.
2.
The human resources director shall serve as advisor of all parties involved of the correct procedural handling of each particular grievance/appeal including the determination of whether an issue is grievable.
3.
Employees are free to seek legal counsel at their expense at any time. However, the employee may be represented by counsel at Step 3 only and such representation is limited to opening and closing statements and written documentation supporting their client's case. Otherwise, employees are required to speak for themselves. It is the intent of this provision to encourage discussion between employees and supervisory staff on matters of mutual concern.
4.
If a grievance/appeal meeting or hearing is held during the normal work hours of any required participant, such participant shall be excused without loss of pay for that purpose. Attendance at grievance/appeal meetings or hearings held outside of normal work hours for any participant shall not be deemed as time worked.
5.
Failure to initiate a grievance/appeal within the time limit shall be deemed a waiver of the grievance/appeal. Failure at any step of this procedure to submit a grievance/appeal to the next step within the specified time limit shall be deemed to be acceptance of the decision at that step.
6.
Failure at any step of this procedure to communicate the decision on a grievance/appeal within the specified time limit shall permit the employee to proceed to the next step as set forth in the preceding paragraph.
7.
Failure of the employee to cooperate, participate and meet as needed will result in dismissal of the grievance/appeal.
8.
The time limits of the procedure maybe extended by the human resources director due to illness, vacations, business travel or other legitimate reasons. If an extension is required, involved all parties will be notified.
9.
This procedure is the only formal process to handle employee complaints. At no time shall an employee approach the mayor or any council member or BLW board member to resolve a grievance or appeal.
10.
The entire written portion of an employee's grievance/appeal and disposition at any level shall be kept in a separate file in the human resources department, under the jurisdiction of the human resources director, and will not be placed in any other file whatsoever.
11.
Any employee who resigns from city/BLW shall be deemed to have waived the right to initiate or to process a grievance or appeal.
B.
Department Heads Hired After February 9, 1994. Department heads hired after February 9, 1994, do not have the right to administrative appeal, grievance procedures or hearing rights. A post-employment name-clearing hearing for such department heads may be conducted at the discretion of the city manager. However, any police chief and fire chief are exempted from these provisions and will be hired and may be terminated in compliance with the City Charter Section 4-12.1.
1.
Step 1: Division Level.
a.
An employee who feels he has a valid reason for complaint should complete the city/BLW grievance/appeal form and submit the completed and signed form to his direct supervisor and/or division manager with a copy to the human resources director within seven calendar days following the incident that gave rise to the complaint. If the grievance is related to ongoing working conditions such as harassment or discrimination, the employee may file a written grievance at any time.
b.
In filing a complaint, the employee should specifically state what action is being grieved or appealed; provide a description of the incident from the employee's perspective including persons involved, dates, time and relevant facts; specific provision(s) of the personnel rules and regulations that the incident pertains to; a statement as to why the employee feels the grievance or appeal is justified; state the remedy sought by defining the action the employee believes should be taken if the grievance or appeal is upheld.
c.
The supervisor and/or division manager shall meet with the employee to discuss the grievance/appeal and communicate a decision in writing to the employee within seven calendar days following receipt of the grievance/appeal. A copy of the division manager's decision shall be sent to the department head and the human resources department.
2.
Step 2: Department Level. If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the employee may submit the grievance form to his department head, with a copy to the human resources director within seven calendar days after receipt of the decision at Step 1. The department head shall meet with the employee to discuss the grievance and communicate a decision in writing to the employee within seven calendar days following receipt of the written grievance. A copy of the department head's decision shall be sent to the human resources department.
3.
Step 3: City Manager Level.
a.
This step is the final level of grievance review and/or appeal for all employees who do not report directly to the city manager. If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, within seven calendar days of receipt of the department head's decision, the employee may submit the grievance with all supporting documents including copies of decisions rendered at Steps 1 and 2 to the city manager.
b.
The city manager will conduct, or designate an impartial individual to conduct either:
(1)
A separate investigation of the grievance to discuss the complaint with the grievant, including a meeting accompanied by his representative if the employee desires representation; or
(2)
A hearing, if the grievance/appeal concerns an adverse action as defined in Section 4-4-20-020. If necessary, the city manager or his designee will conduct a hearing on the grieved or appealed issue at which all-appropriate witnesses and supporting information shall be heard. The hearing shall be recorded. The grievant or appellant may, if he so desires, obtain a copy of the recording at his own expense. The evidentiary portion of this hearing shall be open to the press and public; however, the deliberation of the findings shall occur in closed session. After the city manager or his designee has heard from all involved parties, he will close the meeting.
After consideration of written materials and testimony given at the hearing, if the city manager has designated a hearing officer, such hearing officer will issue a recommendation to the city manager. The grievant/appellant and appropriate department head will receive copies of the hearing officer's recommendation.
The city manager shall communicate a decision in writing to the employee and to the representative, if any, within 30 days following receipt of the written grievance or following the meeting or hearing or following receipt of the recommended decision, whichever is later. Such decision shall be final.
C.
Employees Hired or Promoted Into in a Formal Apprenticeship Program on or After July 1, 2007. Employees hired or promoted into a formal apprenticeship program, such as apprentice electrical lineworker on or after July 1, 2007, do not have the right to administrative appeal, grievance procedures or hearing rights except that such employees have the right to utilize the procedure outlined herein to file complaints of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, disability and political affiliation in accordance with Article 4-4-4. A post-employment name clearing hearing for such employees may be conducted at the discretion of the city manager.
D.
Procedure for Appeals from Actions of the City Manager. This procedure is available to those department heads and employees who report directly to the city manager to assure these employees have access to due process. An employee in this category who feels he has a valid reason for complaint from actions of the city manager should complete the city/BLW grievance/appeal form and submit the completed and signed form to the city manager with a copy to the human resources director within seven calendar days following the incident that gave rise to the complaint. If the grievance is related to ongoing working conditions such as harassment or discrimination, the employee may file a written grievance at any time.
In filing a complaint, the employee should specifically state what action is being grieved or appealed; provide a description of the incident from the employee's perspective including persons involved, dates, time and relevant facts; specific provisions of the personnel rules and regulations that the incident pertains to; a statement as to why the employee feels the grievance or appeal is justified; state the remedy sought by defining the action the employee believes should be taken if the grievance or appeal is upheld.
Since the city manager was the individual taking the aggrieved action, the human resources director shall call for the establishment of an ad hoc hearing board to hear the grievance/appeal. The human resources director or his designee shall communicate the hearing board's final decision in writing to the employee and to the city manager within five days following receipt of the hearing board's decision.
E.
Grievance/Appeal Board to Hear Complaints from Actions of the City Manager. The ad hoc grievance/appeal board is established to hear the grievance or appeal of an employee who directly reports to the city manager, the board shall be composed of:
1.
A part-time municipal court judge as nonvoting chairperson of the board. The mayor shall select one of the judges from the current personnel roster.
2.
The human resources director shall select from the current personnel roster or the pension payroll, two individuals to serve as members of the board as follows:
a.
One appointee to this board shall be a current division manager from a city department other than the department of the grievant.
b.
One appointee to this board may be a current or retired division manager or a retired department head. This appointment should be from a city department other than the department of the grievant and the department of the appointee selected by the human resources director in subparagraph (2)(a) of this section.
3.
The mayor shall select a person who is not a current or retired city/BLW employee and who is a Marietta citizen to serve as the third member of the appeal board.
The chairperson shall determine the procedural rules for the ad hoc grievance/appeal board hearing. The chairperson may also request the city attorney to serve as legal advisor to the grievance/appeal board. The city attorney shall attend the hearing, but shall not be involved in the closed, decision making process of the board or in the deliberations of the board. However, the city attorney shall be available to answer any questions that may arise during the closed session.
All members of this board shall be persons who have no personal relationships with any part to the grievance, that is, not related by blood or marriage, business partners, close personal friends or other relationship or circumstances that would tend to bias the judgment of the board members for or against any party to the grievance or appeal.
There shall be no private, one to one conversations between individual board members and any party to the grievance concerning the merits of the grievance or appeal at any time during the course of the proceedings.
The grievance/appeal board shall hold a hearing on the grieved or appealed issue at which all appropriate witnesses and supporting information shall be heard as determined by the board. The hearing shall be recorded. The grievant or appellant may, if he so desires, obtain a copy of the recording at his own expense. This recording shall be the only official record of the hearing. The evidentiary portion of the hearing before the board shall be open to the press and public, however, the deliberation of the findings of the board shall occur in closed session. After the board has heard from all involved parties, the chairperson will close the meeting. Only the voting members of the board shall be party to the deliberation of the findings of the board. After consideration of written materials and testimony given at the hearing, the board will issue through the chairperson a decision to the human resources director. The grievant/appellant and the city manager will receive copies of the board's decision which shall be final, subject to the right of appeal by either the city or the employee to a court of proper jurisdiction.
