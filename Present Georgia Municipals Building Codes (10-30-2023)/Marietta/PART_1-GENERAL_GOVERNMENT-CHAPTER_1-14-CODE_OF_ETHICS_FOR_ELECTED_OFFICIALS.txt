Such relationship shall not preclude participation and voting on a subject.
(Ord. No. 7834, 8/12/2015, § 1)
1-14-2-060 - Abstention to avoid conflicts of interest.
A.
It shall be a violation of this code of ethics for any elected official or board member to participate in an official capacity as an elected official or board member upon the following, each of which is deemed to be a conflict of interest except as provided in Subsection G., below, or in Section 1-14-2-70:

B.
Except as provided in Subsection C., if any elected official or board member has a conflict of interest or has an interest that he has reason to believe either violates this code of ethics or affects his or her official acts or actions in any matter prohibited, the elected official or board member shall not have a vote as to such matter and shall not participate as an official or board member during the discussion of said matter. If the official wishes to comment upon the matter as a member of the public, he or she may leave the dais temporarily and address, upon recognition by chair, the council or board from the public podium under the same procedures offered to the general public. If the discussion of such matter shall occur in executive session, such member shall vacate such executive session until discussion on that matter has been completed.

Nothing herein shall prohibit an elected official or board member from publicly stating that a conflict of interest exists and/or the nature of the conflict as well as participating on the procedural matter if the item is placed on the consent agenda showing the elected official or board member abstaining on the item.
D.
Except where an item is on the "consent agenda" or as otherwise permitted under this section, any conflict of interest which prohibits an elected official or board member from voting on an issue shall also prohibit an elected official or board member from presiding during the issue being heard.
E.
Nothing herein shall require the elected official or board member to absent himself or herself from her seat while action is taken for any item for which the elected official or board member has a conflict of interest which is contained on a "consent agenda" and upon which there is no deliberation provided the elected official's conflict has been disclosed and the elected official abstains from voting on that particular item on the "consent agenda" and while voting for the "consent agenda", except as noted. (Note: The elected official may vote for the adoption of the "consent agenda" provided it shows that he or she abstained from that particular item on the consent agenda.)
F.
An elected official may abstain from a portion of a motion that the elected official has a conflict on and not have to abstain from the remainder of the items contained in the motion for which there is no conflict of interest. However, an elected official with a conflict may not make or second the motion to approve.
G.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event of an ordinance of general application or a matter of city wide, district wide application or an amendment thereto applying to all covered in a category or by the entire ordinance, or in the event such vote would be proper under Section 1-14-2-70, such elected official shall disclose such item(s) requiring disclosure under O.C.G.A. § 21-5-50, as amended (if said item(s) have not already been disclosed) and, following such disclosure, shall be allowed to vote on such matter(s) and said vote shall not constitute a violation of these rules and shall not be the subject matter of an ethics complaint hereunder. This paragraph shall not apply where the elected official is the only one in the covered category.

By filing a complaint pursuant to this ethics ordinance, the non-employee complainant agrees to and subjects themselves to the obligations under this paragraph.

A dismissal, without any other finding(s) by the ethics committee, shall preclude any action, against the complainant, by the city for attorney's fees and expenses in relation to the complaint.
