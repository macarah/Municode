4-12-2-025 - Employee health insurance and protected health information.
A.
Purpose: To establish privacy procedures to assure that the confidentiality of individually identifiable health information is protected, to inform employees of their privacy rights and obligations and how their protected health information (PHI) may be used and disclosed.
B.
Policy: The City of Marietta/BLW (plan sponsor) established and maintains a group health plan (the "plan") for its employees and covered dependents. The Plan is a covered entity and is required to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. The plan sponsor is not a covered entity but is responsible for ensuring that the group health plan is in compliance with the privacy regulations. The privacy regulations will give employees and covered dependents more control and access to their PHI. It will limit the use and disclosure of health information; enable participants to find out how their information may be used and what disclosures of their information have been made. Medical information relating to family and medical leave, fitness-for-duty and workers compensation is not covered under the regulations. It is the policy of the City of Marietta Group Health Plan to protect the privacy of protected health information and to comply with HIPAA Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information. Where state law is more restrictive than the privacy regulations, Georgia state law will prevail. The city/BLW specifically reserves the right to add to, change or abolish the provisions of this policy, in whole or in part, based upon pertinent action by any appropriate legislative, judicial or regulatory authority.
C.
Definitions:
Covered Entities. Health plans (includes health flexible spending accounts), health care clearinghouses and those health care providers who conduct certain financial and administrative transactions electronically.
Protected Health Information. Individually identifiable health information that is maintained or communicated in any form (electronic, paper, or oral) by a covered entity.
D.
Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information (PHI):
1.
Required Uses and Disclosures. The plan is required to give employees and dependents access to their own protected health information (PHI) upon request and will disclose PHI to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services when needed to investigate or determine if the city/BLW is in compliance with the privacy rules.
2.
Permitted Uses and Disclosures to Carry Out Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations.
a.
The plan and/or its business associates may use and disclose protected health information without the employee's consent, authorization or opportunity to agree or object to carry out treatment, payment or health care operations.
Treatment includes the provision, coordination or management of health care. For example, the plan may tell a doctor who is treating a covered individual that the individual has previously been treated for a condition that may affect his treatment of the individual.
As defined by the privacy rule, payment includes but is not limited to actions to make coverage determinations and payment (including billing, claims management, subrogation, plan reimbursement, reviews for medical necessity, appropriateness of care, utilization review and preauthorization). For example, the plan may tell a doctor whether the employee is eligible for coverage or what percentage of the bill will be paid by the plan.
Health care operations include but are not limited to quality assessment and improvement, reviewing competence or qualifications of health care professionals, underwriting, premium rating and other insurance activities relating to creating or renewing insurance contracts. It also includes disease management, case management, conducting or arranging for medical review, legal services and auditing functions including fraud and abuse, compliance programs, business planning and development, business management and general administrative activities. For example, the plan may use information about the employee claims to refer the employee to a disease management program, reimburse business associates for claims paid on behalf of the plan or project future benefit costs or audit the accuracy of its claims processing functions.
b.
The plan may disclose information to business associates as needed to enable them to provide business services on behalf of the plan. Business associate services may include claims administration, legal, actuarial, consulting, accounting and financial services. For example, the plan may disclose information to a consultant that performs actuarial services, cost sharing methodology, budgeting and plan design changes on behalf of the plan.
The plan requires all business associates to sign contracts agreeing:
(1)
Not to use or disclose the PHI other than as permitted by the contract or as required by law;
(2)
Use appropriate safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of the information other than as provided by the contract or by the privacy rules;
(3)
Assist the plan in complying with the regulations by providing participants upon request access to protected health information disclosures.
c.
Where the plan sponsor does not already have access to PHI by virtue of its role in administering the plan, the plan will not disclose PHI to the plan sponsor except when the disclosure is:
(1)
Limited summary health information for insurance placement or settlor functions;
(2)
Enrollment and disenrollment information;
(3)
Involved in plan administration when the plan sponsor complies with certain administrative requirements involving an amendment of the plan document and the erection of proper firewalls; and
(4)
Authorized by the individual to whom it applies.
The plan sponsor has amended the plan document and certified that the plan sponsor will appropriately safeguard and limit the use and disclosure of protected health information to carry out plan administration functions. Plan administration functions do not include employment-related functions or functions in connection with other benefits.
3.
Uses and Disclosures that Require the Employee's Written Authorization. Any written authorization for the plan to disclose PHI other than as described herein shall be in plain language and satisfy the following requirements:

g.
The authorization must include a statement describing the individual's right to revoke the authorization and of the mechanism for making such a revocation, as to disclosures that have not taken place before the revocation is received by the plan.
h.
The authorization must state either that the plan may not condition treatment, payment, enrollment or eligibility on the individual's execution of an authorization or, when this is not accurate, describe the consequences of not providing the authorization.
i.
The authorization must include a statement that once information is disclosed pursuant to the authorization, the recipient's use of the information is not subject to the privacy rules.
The plan will provide the individual with a copy of the signed authorization. The plan may but is not required to maintain a standard authorization form that can be completed by covered individuals.
Generally, the plan will obtain the employee's written authorization before any uses and disclosures will be made pertaining to psychotherapy notes obtained from a psychotherapist. The plan may use and disclose such notes when needed by the plan to defend against litigation filed by the employee or covered dependent.
4.
Uses and Disclosures that Require that the Employee be Given an Opportunity to Agree or Disagree Prior to the Use or Release. Disclosures of employees' PHI to family members, other relatives and to employees' close personal friends are allowed if the information is directly relevant to the family or friend's involvement with the employee's care or payment for that care and the employee has either agreed to the disclosure or has been given an opportunity to object and have not objected.
5.
Uses and Disclosures for Which Consent, Authorization or Opportunity to Object is Not Required. Use and disclosure of the employee's PHI is allowed without the employee's consent, authorization or request under the following circumstances:

6.
Verification of Identity of Person Requesting PHI. The plan will verify the identify of any person requesting PHI by requesting the person's name, address, business affiliation, phone number and signature, and/or such other identification as it deems appropriate. The plan will document the responses it receives and, when appropriate, take steps to confirm that the information is accurate.
7.
Minimum Necessary. The plan and plan sponsor will make every reasonable effort to limit their use and disclosure of PHI to the minimum necessary unless there is a specific exception to the rules. The minimum necessary standard will not apply, for example to disclosures authorized by the individual or to information that is used for treatment.
8.
De-identified PHI. Information that has been de-identified so that all identifying information is removed may be disclosed.
E.
Participant Rights and Responsibilities:

A single 30-day extension is allowed if the plan is unable to comply with the deadline provided the plan notifies the participant within the original 30-day time limit.
3.
Right to Amend PHI. Participants have a right to request amendment to the participant's PHI. The plan must comply within 60 days unless the plan did not create the PHI or believes the amendment is inaccurate.

F.
Personal Representative: The employee or his or her personal representative will be required to complete a form to request access to this information. A personal representative will be required to produce evidence of his or her authority to act on the employee's behalf before that person will be given access to the employee's PHI or allowed to take any action for the employee.

To request access to PHI or to obtain a form for this purpose, please contact the benefits manager whose office is located in the human resources department. The benefits manager has 30 days to respond to the employee's request and 60 days if someone else holds the information or it is offsite. If the employee's request is denied, the employee or his or her personal representative will be provided with a written denial setting forth the basis of the denial, the complaint procedure and how the employee or personal representative may file a complaint to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

4-12-2-040 - Retiree health insurance.
A.
All full-time employees hired between August 14, 1991 and October 31, 2006, may continue their health insurance coverage after retirement from active service. Effective July 1, 2003, the city/BLW will contribute toward the cost of retiree health insurance for such employees on the following basis:
1.
20+ years of employee service. If hired after August 14, 1991, and before November 14, 1996, the city will contribute 100 percent of the calculated premium cost of retiree health care coverage (HMO and PPO plans). If hired between November 14, 1996 and October 31, 2006, the city/BLW will contribute 100 percent of the calculated premium cost of the retiree coverage on the city/BLW's basic health care plan (currently the HMO plan). The city/BLW will not contribute to the calculated premium cost of retiree dependent coverage except that the calculated premium cost to the retiree if he/she elects to cover such dependents will be frozen at time of retirement.
2.
15—19 years of employee service. If hired after August 14, 1991, and before November 14, 1996, the city/BLW will contribute 80 percent of the calculated premium cost of retiree health care coverage (HMO and PPO plans). If hired between November 14, 1996 and October 31, 2006, the city/BLW will contribute 80 percent of the calculated premium cost of the retiree coverage on the city/BLW's basic health care plan (currently the HMO plan). The calculated premium cost to the retiree for retiree coverage will be frozen at time of retirement. The city/BLW will not contribute to the calculated premium cost of retiree dependent coverage and rate increases for dependent coverage will be passed on to the retiree as they occur.
3.
10—14 years of employee service. If hired after August 14, 1991, and before November 14, 1996, the city/BLW will contribute 50 percent of the calculated premium cost of retiree health care coverage (HMO and PPO plans). If hired between November 14, 1996 and October 31, 2006, the city/BLW will contribute 50 percent of the calculated premium cost of the retiree coverage on the city/BLW's basic health care plan (currently the HMO plan). The calculated premium cost to the retiree for retiree coverage will be frozen for such employees at time of retirement. The city/BLW will not contribute to the calculated premium cost of retiree dependent coverage and rate increases for dependent coverage will be passed on to the retiree as they occur.
4.
Less than 10 years of employee service. If hired between August 14, 1991 and October 31, 2006, the employee may continue their health coverage after retirement from continuous, active service, but the retired employee must pay 100 percent of the retiree calculated premium cost and 100 percent of the dependent calculated premium cost if the retiree elects dependent coverage and all rate increases thereon.
5.
The city/BLW regularly monitors the marketplace for legitimate opportunities to reduce the cost of retiree health care coverage without reducing or otherwise negatively impacting such coverage. When such opportunities are identified and implemented, the city/BLW desires to be able to pass some or all of the resulting cost reductions on to the retirees receiving such coverage. To this end, for purposes of Section 4-12-2-40, the term "frozen at retirement" henceforth shall mean that the calculated premium cost to the retiree for retiree coverage shall not exceed the cost paid by the retiree at the time of his/her retirement. As so defined, nothing in Section 4-12-2-40 shall preclude the city/BLW, in its sole discretion, from reducing the calculated premium cost to the retiree below the cost paid by the retiree at the time of his/her retirement when the circumstances described above so permit. Likewise, in the event the calculated premium cost to the retiree is so reduced, the city/BLW reserves the right to increase said premium cost up to, but not in excess of, the cost paid by the retiree at the time of his/her retirement. Nothing in this section is intended or shall be interpreted or applies as granting any retiree a vested or enforceable right to retiree coverage at a premium cost below the cost he/she paid at the time of his/her retirement.
B.
All full-time employees hired on or after November 1, 2006, with a minimum of 10 years full-time continuous, active service may continue their health care coverage after retirement provided such health care coverage is elected and provided by the City of Marietta at time of retirement. Effective November 1, 2006, the city/BLW will contribute toward the cost of this retiree health insurance on the following basis for such employees:
1.
20+ years of continuous employee service for those employees hired on or after November 1, 2006. The city/BLW will contribute 85 percent of the calculated premium cost of retiree single coverage for the City/BLW's basic health care plan (currently the HMO). Such benefit will be limited to cover the city/BLW retiree only. The dollar amount of the retiree contribution will not be frozen and will increase as the calculated premium cost for coverage increases to the city/BLW. The city/BLW will not contribute to the calculated premium cost of retiree dependent coverage and rate increases for dependent coverage will be passed on to the retiree as they occur.

Completion of five years of total credited service, or
b.
Attainment of age 60 if such participant is a Level 1 employee, or age 70 if such participant is a Level 2 employee, as defined in article III, section 2.
c.
If such participant does not elect to retire at the normal retirement age, (a) or (b) above shall become his normal retirement date and upon actual retirement he shall receive the retirement benefit for which he became eligible at the occurrence of (a) or (b) above.
B.
Subsequent to the first anniversary of the effective date, retirement may not be delayed beyond age 60 for a participant who is a Level 1 employee, or age 70 for a participant who is a Level 2 employee, as defined in article III, section 2.
Section 5. Disability retirement date.
A participant may retire under the provisions of the plan on the first day of the first calendar month in which a participant becomes entitled to receive disability benefits under article VIII. Upon actual retirement, such participant shall receive the disability retirement benefit provided in article V, section 4, or any other retirement benefit granted under the plan for which he is eligible if such benefit is greater than the aforesaid disability retirement benefit. However, under no circumstances shall any retired participant be entitled at one time to more than one type of retirement benefit granted under the plan.
Section 6. Elected and appointed members of the governing authority.
If an elected or appointed member of the governing authority is holding an elective office of the governing authority when he becomes eligible for normal retirement as provided in this article IV, section 2.A.3., his retirement shall be delayed until the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the date he vacates such elective office.

A participant may retire from the service of the city at any time after the date that the sum of his age and credited service equals at least 80.

Retirement Benefits
Section 1. Normal retirement benefit.
A.
Reserved.
1.
Reserved.
2.
The monthly retirement benefit is a. or b., whichever is greater:
a.
One and one-third percent (1.33%) of the final average earnings of the participant, multiplied by total years of credited service plus credit granted pursuant to article II, section 45, divided by twelve (12); or
b.
The monthly retirement benefit as computed under the plan formerly in existence prior to January 1, 1984; said benefit shall be calculated in accordance with Appendix "A".
B.
The following provisions shall apply to the calculation of a. above:
1.
Credited past service.
a.
Credited past service shall be the amount of past service of a participant. Breaks in regular full-time employment prior to the effective date of the plan followed by five (5) years of service or leave of absence will not break continuity of service but the time absent will not be considered as a period of credited past service.
b.
Any full-time eligible employee who does not elect to become a participant as of the date he is first qualified to do so may elect to become a participant on the first day of any succeeding month; provided, however, that the credited past service of such participant shall not include the period of service from the date he was first qualified to become a participant to the date he elects to become a participant, or any creditable past service due him on the date he was first qualified to become a participant under the plan; and, further provided that he has enough time remaining until normal retirement age to accrue at least five (5) years of total credited service.
2.
Credited future service shall be as defined in article II, section 27, and limited to time spent as a participant in the service of the city, except as provided in article III, section 4.D. Breaks in any tenure of elective office of an elected or appointed member of the governing authority will not break continuity of service but the time absent will not be considered as a period of credited future service.
3.
Total credited service, both past and future, shall be the sum of credited past and credited future service. The amount of total credited service for any participant shall be unlimited except that:
a.
No credit will be given for service performed as an eligible employee of the city which precedes a participant's most recent date of employment as a new employee; and
b.
Total credited service shall not exceed the total calendar years and complete months during which a participant was either an eligible employee or an elected or appointed member of the governing authority or both.
4.
Final average earnings shall mean the average of the annual earnings paid to a participant during any consecutive three (3) year period preceding his actual date of retirement in which his earnings were highest; or if he had less than three (3) years of total credited service, then his final average earnings shall be his average earnings for his total credited service.
5.
Maximum annual earnings to be used for computing final average earnings shall be unlimited.
6.
Final average earnings as defined in subparagraph (4) above shall be used for computing the monthly retirement benefit except as herein otherwise provided.
7.
Full months of credited past and future service shall be treated as fractions of one (1) year. Partial months shall not be included in the calculation.
C.
An employee who retired under the provisions of any superseded plan prior to November 1, 1973, shall be entitled to a monthly benefit in addition to any benefit he is now receiving, effective the first day of September, 1977, and payable on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of said monthly benefit shall be the difference between (a) the benefit such retired employee is now receiving from New England Life Insurance Company under the terms of the superseded plan and (b) the amount he would have received as a Class 2 participant under the terms of article V, section 1.A. of this plan if this plan had been in effect at the time of his retirement. Any payments made pursuant to this paragraph shall cease upon the death of the retiree.
(Ord. No. 5923, 11/11/98, § 3; Ord. No. 5939, 12/10/98, §§ 1, 2; Ord. No. 6339, 12/12/2001, § 2)
Section 2. Early retirement benefit.
A participant, upon retirement on his early retirement date, shall, at his election, receive either:
A.
The amount of each monthly retirement benefit for early retirement shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal retirement benefit, but the benefit so computed shall be reduced by .167% for each full month retired early from age fifty-five (55); or
B.
A delayed monthly retirement benefit under which payment shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the retired participant's fifty-fifth (55th) birthday if such participant is a Level 1 employee, or sixty-fifth (65th) birthday if such participant is a Level 2 employee, as defined in article III, section 2, and shall be payable on the first day of each month thereafter during the lifetime of the participant. The amount of each monthly retirement benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal retirement benefit.
(Ord. No. 5922, 11/11/98, § 1)
Section 3. Delayed retirement benefit.
The delayed retirement benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as the normal retirement benefit, and said benefit shall be increased actuarially due to the participant's actual age at retirement in accordance with the tables set forth in Appendix F.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event may distribution of a participant's retirement benefit commence later than the first day of April in the calendar year following the later of (a) the calendar year in which the participant attains age 70½, or (b) the calendar year in which the participant retires. If, as of January 1, 2002, a participant is an employee in active employment with the employer and is receiving distributions on account of his attaining age 70½, the participant shall continue to receive plan distributions.
The following rules shall apply for purposes of determining the required minimum distribution to participants and designated beneficiaries (as defined below) for calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 2003, even if, in the case of a designated beneficiary, the participant died before 2003.
(a)
Required distribution. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan. This section 3 shall, instead, be deemed to limit and modify any provision of this Plan to the extent that such limitation or modification is necessary to ensure that the plan complies with this section 3, Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder.
The entire interest of each participant in this plan will be distributed, beginning not later than the required beginning date described above, over the life of such participant or over the lives of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant or the life expectancy of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary.
(b)
Death of participant after distribution has begun. If distribution of a participant's interest has begun in accordance with the paragraph (a) above (i.e., distributions on or after the required beginning date), and if the participant dies before his or her entire interest has been distributed to him, then the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under paragraph (a) as of the date of the participant's death.
(c)
Death of participant before distribution has begun. If a participant dies before distribution of the participant's interest has begun in accordance with paragraph (a) above (i.e., no distributions have been made on or after the required beginning date), the entire interest of the Participant must be paid over whichever of the following periods is applicable:
(i)
If one or more Designated Beneficiary is not the Participant's Spouse, the distribution period shall be the Designated Beneficiary's remaining life expectancy.
(ii)
If the sole Designated Beneficiary is the Participant's Spouse, the distribution period shall be the Spouse's remaining life expectancy.
(iii)
If there is no Designated Beneficiary, the entire benefit (if any is payable) shall be distributed by the end of the calendar year that includes the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death.
Distributions under paragraph (c)(i)—(iii) above shall commence as follows:
(x)
Distributions under (c)(i) (i.e., distribution to a non-spouse designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the end of the calendar year that begins immediately after the calendar year in which the participant died.
(y)
Distributions under (c)(ii) (i.e., distribution to a spousal designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the later of the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died and the end of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70½.
(d)
Form of distribution. Any distribution payable under this section 3 may be paid in any optional form of benefit that is available under the plan, provided that all consent and eligibility requirements under the plan are satisfied. Any annuity form of distribution payable under this plan, however, must satisfy the following requirements:
(i)
The distribution must be in the form of a periodic annuity for the Participant's life, or for the joint life expectancy of the Participant and Designated Beneficiary or over a period certain that does not exceed the maximum length of the period certain determined under the Regulations.
(ii)
The interval between payments must be uniform over the entire distribution period and must not exceed one year.
(iii)
If payments have commenced over a period certain, the period certain may not be changed.
(iv)
Distributions in the form of a life annuity must satisfy the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6T, A-2, or any successor regulation thereto.
(v)
All payments, either in the form of a life annuity or over a period certain must either be non-increasing or increase only in accordance with the rules set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6T, A-1.
For purposes of this Section 3, references to a life annuity shall include an annuity for the joint life expectancy of the Participant and the Designated Beneficiary.
(e)
Incidental death benefit requirement. Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant or designated beneficiary must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G). This rule insures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental.
(f)
Pension board's discretion. The pension board for the city shall have the sole authority and full discretion to apply the provisions of this section 3 to any benefit option elected by the participant or designated beneficiary. The plan administrator may, for example, modify a participant's selection of an optional form of benefit to satisfy the incidental death benefit requirement by requiring, at its discretion, that the participant select another form of benefit or another contingent annuitant, or by modifying the form of benefit so that it complies with the applicable rules.
(g)
Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this section 3, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary.
(i)
Designated beneficiary. The term "designated beneficiary" shall be determined in accordance with the definition of "beneficiary" in the regulations, notwithstanding that this definition may be different from that set forth elsewhere in this plan, provided that any individual who is a designated beneficiary must also be a beneficiary (but not necessarily all of the beneficiaries) as defined in this plan. Each beneficiary, as defined in the plan, however, need not be a designated beneficiary in the event, for example, that a beneficiary disclaims his interest under this plan.
(ii)
Spouse. "Spouse" shall mean "spouse" as defined in the regulations. Nothing in this section 3 shall be deemed, however, to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan.
(iii)
Regulations. "Regulations" shall refer to the Treasury Regulations (including temporary regulations) promulgated under Code Section 401(a)(9), as set forth in Treasury Regulations 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-6T, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS in the form of revenue rulings, notices and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or any successor thereto.
(Ord. No. 6340, 12/12/2001, § 3; Ord. No. 6483, 2/12/2003, § 2(2))
Section 4. Disability retirement benefit.
The amount of the disability retirement benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as the normal retirement benefit with no actuarial reduction for age imposed. In no event, however, will a participant's disability retirement benefit be less than fifty percent (50%) of the average of the participant's most recent 12 months of earnings preceding his termination of employment as a result of a disability. Upon retirement on his disability retirement date, a participant shall receive a monthly retirement benefit commencing on the first day of the month coinciding with his disability retirement date and payable on the first day of each month thereafter so long as his disability continues.
(Ord. No. 6465, 11/13/2002, § 1)
Section 5. Cost-of-living adjustment.
A.
The amount of the benefits payable under this plan to a participant classified as a Level 1 employee as defined in article III, section 2, or his beneficiary, shall be adjusted by the current average cost-of-living index figure as provided herein.
B.
The current average cost-of-living index figure shall be ascertained as of August 1 in each year.
C.
Each monthly retirement benefit then being received shall thereupon be adjusted as follows:
1.
Each monthly retirement benefit shall be increased by a percentage equal to the percentage representing the current average cost-of-living index figure divided by each recipient's cost-of-living base figure. If the current average cost-of-living index figure is less than the average cost-of-living index figure determined on August 1 of the previous calendar year, no reduction in the monthly retirement benefit shall be effected.
2.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, no increase in the amount of a monthly retirement benefit due to changes in the current average cost-of-living index figure effective at any annual adjustment date August 1 shall be in excess of an average increase of four percent (4%) of the amount of the monthly retirement benefits payable immediately prior to such participant's or beneficiary's applicable adjustment date.
Section 6. Suspension of benefits.
A.
Any retirement pension payable under this plan to any participant who shall have retired or been retired pursuant to any provisions of article IV or whose service with the city shall have terminated on or after his vesting date shall be suspended as of the date he is reemployed by the city on a full-time basis if retired under article IV, sections 1, 2, 3 and 5 or in any capacity (full-time or less than full-time) if retired under the provisions of article IV, section 4 or holds an elective office of the governing authority except as otherwise provided herein and shall be resumed as of the first day of the month coinciding with or next following his subsequent retirement. In any case where the payment of a participant's retirement pension shall have been so suspended, the retirement pension payable on his subsequent retirement (whether before or after his normal retirement date) shall be the benefit computed in accordance with this article V on the basis of his aggregate credited service, and for an eligible employee on the basis of his final average earnings, at the time of his subsequent retirement, but reduced on an actuarial basis by the value of an early retirement benefits received by him prior to being reemployed as an eligible employee or return to elective office, except that the resulting benefit shall not be less than the benefit payable at the time of his previous retirement. For the purposes of this section 6, any such participant's credited service subsequent to his reemployment by the city or holding of an elective office of the governing authority shall commence as of the date of his reemployment as an eligible employee or as of the date his term of elective office begins, whichever is applicable.
B.
Any disability retirement pension payable under this plan to any participant who shall have retired or been retired pursuant to any provisions of article IV, section 5, shall be suspended as of the date his disability ceases. In any case where the payment of a participant's disability retirement pension shall have been so suspended, said period of absence from employment due to such disability shall be treated as a leave of absence without pay and the provisions of article III, section 4 shall apply except that such period of absence shall not be counted as credited future service. Any participant who shall have retired or been retired pursuant to the provisions of article IV, section 5 and who dies or who has been or shall be subsequently declared ineligible for a disability retirement benefit because of a cessation of said disability shall have a right to any benefit afforded under any other provision of this plan to which he or his beneficiary might otherwise be entitled. In such a case any disability retirement payments made prior to the date his disability ceases or is declared to no longer exist shall be retained by the retiree and disregarded in computing any other benefit payable under this plan.
(Ord. No. 6284, 9/12/2001, § 1)
Section 7. Alternate retirement benefit.
The alternate retirement benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as the unreduced early retirement benefit in accordance with section 5 of article V of Exhibit B of City Code Section 4-12-6-010, known as the Consolidated Retirement Plan for the Employees of the City of Marietta, Georgia. The participant shall be entitled to elect to receive the benefit in any one of the forms of payment described in article VII of Exhibit B of City Code Section 4-12-6-010, known as the Consolidated Retirement Plan for the Employees of the City of Marietta, Georgia.
If this alternate retirement benefit is voluntarily elected by the participant, then:
1.
The participant shall forfeit any and all rights now and in the future to the cost-of-living adjustment set forth in section 5 of article V of this plan, Exhibit A of City Code Section 4-12-4-010, known as the 4022 Retirement Plan. However, any cost-of-living adjustment approved under Exhibit B of City Code Section 4-12-6-010, known as the Consolidated Retirement Plan for the Employees of the City of Marietta, Georgia shall be provided to the participant;
2.
Survivor benefits shall not be payable upon the death of participant, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, unless post-retirement benefits are provided under the optional form of payment elected by the participant at retirement; and
3.
The participant's spouse (if married at retirement) must consent to the election of this retirement option.
(Ord. No. 6509, 5/14/2003, § 2)
ARTICLE VI
Optional Form of Retirement Income
Section 1. Election of optional retirement benefit.
A participant may elect, or may revoke said election, at any time prior to his actual retirement date, to have his retirement benefit payable under the option hereinafter set forth in lieu of the retirement benefit he is otherwise entitled to receive. The option shall only be available if the participant retires at his normal retirement date. The benefit shall be paid in accordance with the terms of said option. Election of said option shall be made by the participant in writing.
Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of proposed Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-2, or its successor. This rule ensures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental.
(Ord. No. 6340, 12/12/2001, § 4)
Section 2. Description of option.
The amount of the optional retirement benefit set forth below shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of benefit that would otherwise be payable to the participant under article V.
Option A: Social Security option. An increased retirement benefit payable to the participant during his lifetime until his retirement benefits commence under O.A.S.D.I. and a decreased retirement benefit payable thereafter for life in order to have a more level retirement income when such decreased retirement benefit is added to his primary benefits under O.A.S.D.I. determined as of his early retirement date; said benefit shall be computed in accordance with the tables set forth in Appendix "C". At the death of the participant all payments will cease and no further benefits will accrue to the estate of the participant or to other persons except as provided in article III, section 2. This option shall be known as Option A. If the benefit determined to be payable from the plan, when O.A.S.D.I. benefits commence, results in a negative balance, this option cannot be elected.
(Ord. No. 4548, 4/8/87, § 1)
Section 3. Cancellation of election.
The election by a participant of said option in section 2 of this article VI shall be null and void if the participant shall die before benefits commence.
ARTICLE VII
Death or Termination of Employment
Section 1. Death prior to retirement.
A.
If the employment or term of elective office of a participant is terminated by reason of his death prior to his retirement in accordance with the provisions of article IV, there shall be payable to his designated beneficiary a monthly death benefit actuarially equivalent to the participant's anticipated normal retirement benefit assuming that his age at the time of his death is fifty-five (55) if he is a Level 1 employee, or sixty-five (65) if he is a Level 2 employee, as defined in article III, section 2; said benefit shall be computed in accordance with the tables set forth in Appendix "D".
B.
Designation of a beneficiary prior to retirement may be changed by the participant in writing at any time prior to actual retirement on a form provided for that purpose. Only the last such designation of a beneficiary prior to retirement will have effect and any new designation of a beneficiary prior to retirement invalidates, supersedes, and revokes any prior designation.
(Ord. No. 4485, 7/9/86, § 1; Ord. No. 4500, 8/13/86, § 1; Ord. No. 4653, 7/13/88, § 1 (Exhibit B))
Section 2. Death after retirement.
Upon the death of a participant subsequent to his retirement in accordance with article IV, sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, a monthly death benefit shall be paid to his designated beneficiary, said benefit shall be computed in accordance with the tables set forth in Appendix "E".
(Ord. No. 4485, 7/9/86, § 1; Ord. No. 4653, 7/13/88, § 1 (Exhibit B))
Amendment note—Ord. No. 4485, 7/9/86, deleted Art. VII, sections 1, 2; Ord. No. 4500, 8/13/86, added Art. VII, section 1; subsequently, Ord. No. 4653, 7/13/88, reinstated former Art. VII, sections 1, 2 as adopted by Ord. No. 4022, 2/8/84.
Editorial note—Ord. No. 4655, 7/13/88, § 1, provided as follows:
Section 1: Ordinance No. 4022, which adopted a new retirement plan for the employees of the City of Marietta, Georgia, is hereby amended by permitting any employee that retired from the City of Marietta, Georgia prior to January 1, 1984, to be eligible to receive the death benefits which have been reinstated pursuant to Ordinance No. 4653. The rights and obligations with respect to any employee or beneficiary that has already commenced to receiving benefits for any for any reason whatsoever prior to the effective date of this Ordinance are fixed and shall be governed by such retirement plan as it existed and was in effect at the time said benefits commenced. It is hereby declared to be the specific intention of the Ordinance that no participant or beneficiary shall be eligible or entitled to receive more than one type of benefit from the City of Marietta, Georgia by virtue of the passage of this Ordinance. Rather, it is the intention of this Ordinance to permit employees that retired prior to January 1, 1984, to be eligible for the death benefits which have been reinstated pursuant to Ordinance No. 4653 but not to provide duplicate benefits for any employee or beneficiary that has already commenced receiving benefits prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.
Section 3. Termination of employment before retirement.
A.
A participant, other than an elected or appointed member of the governing authority who is not an eligible employee, whose employment is terminated under any of the following conditions for any reason other than death, disability, or retirement shall be entitled to a vested right in his accrued retirement benefits. Payment of such vested retirement benefit shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or next following his normal or early retirement age at the option of the participant and shall be payable on the first day of each month thereafter during the life of the participant. The amount of each monthly retirement benefit shall be computed in the manner prescribed for normal or early retirement in Article V herein, but based upon his final average earnings and total credited service up to the participant's date of termination of employment with the city.
1.
A participant whose employment is terminated voluntarily or involuntarily shall be entitled to a vested benefit if he has completed a minimum of five (5) years of credited service in the plan.
2.
A participant whose employment is terminated voluntarily or involuntarily because he is disabled shall be entitled to a vested benefit provided he qualifies for disability retirement under the provisions of the plan within one (1) year of said termination of employment.
Section 4. Termination of tenure of elective office.
A participant who is an elected or appointed member of the governing authority and who is not regularly employed in the services of the city shall be entitled to a vested right if he has completed a minimum of ten years of credited service in the plan.
ARTICLE VIII
Disability Benefits
Section 1. Definition.
An employee will be considered disabled if unable, solely because of disease or accidental bodily injury, to work at his or her own occupation or at any reasonable occupation for which the employee is engaged, or may reasonably become engaged, fitted by education, training or experience; provided, however, that such disability shall not have been (a) self-inflicted; (b) incurred in military service; (c) incurred in the commission of a felonious enterprise; or (d) the result of the use of narcotics or drugs or habitual drunkenness. Notwithstanding the fact that an employee may initially be determined disabled, disability benefits shall terminate upon the occurrence of any events set forth in section 5.
(Ord. No. 4332, 5/14/86, § 1)
Section 2. Covered employee.
Only full-time employees who have completed twelve (12) months of continuous service shall be eligible for disability retirement.
Section 3. Application for disability retirement.
It is the responsibility of the employee to file an application for disability retirement with the secretary of the pension board within thirty (30) days of the date that the employee last worked or last received pay for the accumulated leave.
Section 4. Evidence of disability.
Upon receipt and acceptance for disability retirement by the pension board, the applicant must furnish such evidence of disability in writing from the applicants' physician to substantiate a claim of disability as set forth in the definition of disability established in section 1 above. The pension board may request such additional evidence as it deems necessary to substantiate a disability claim including additional examination by an independent physician of its choice. The cost of such additional examination shall be paid by the City of Marietta.
Section 5. Termination of disability entitlement.
A period of total disability ceases on the earliest to occur of the following:
A.
The date the employee ceases to be totally disabled.
B.
The date the employee commences work at a reasonable occupation means any gainful activity for which the employee is engaged, or may reasonably become engaged, fitted by education, training or experience.
C.
The date the employee fails to furnish proof of the continuance of total disability or refuses to be examined when required.
D.
The date the employee ceases to be under the care of a physician.
E.
The date of the employee's death.
Section 6. Successive period of disability.
Notwithstanding the fact that an employee may initially be determined disabled, and subsequently have disability benefits terminated because of the occurrence of any event set forth in Section 5, said employee may continue to be eligible for a successive period of disability benefits, if said employee is later determined disabled again as provided under this article. The purpose of the successive disabilities rule is to encourage the employee to return to full-time work by assuring if the disability occurs again due to the same or related cause soon after returning to work, the employee will not have to complete a new qualifying period in order to qualify for benefits.
Section 7. Definition of physician.
The term "physician" means a legally qualified physician, except that with respect to a period of total disability, or any portion thereof, during which total disability is caused by any condition other than a medically determinable physical impairment, "physician" shall mean a legally qualified physician who either specializes in the practice of psychiatric medicine or has by reason of training or experience, a specialized competency in the field of psychiatric medicine sufficient to render the necessary evaluation and treatment of mental illness. To be "legally qualified," an individual must be licensed to practice medicine as a physician under the governing law of his state, territory, or foreign country, and said license must be issued by the respective medical board. In Georgia, the physician must be licensed to practice in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 43-34-1 et seq., as amended.
(Ord. No. 7872, 3/9/2016, § 1)
Section 8. Dispute and regulation interpretation.
In the event that a dispute arises concerning any entitlement or interpretation of any portion of the regulations established under this retirement ordinance, the pension board shall settle such dispute by a majority vote of the members of the board and such decisions are final and binding on all parties subject to provision for appeal and reapplication.
Section 9. Appeal and reapplication.
In the event that an applicant for disability retirement is dissatisfied with a decision of the pension board with respect to the employee's entitlement or eligibility for disability benefits, the applicant may reapply for eligibility no sooner than six months from the receipt of the board's decision. Request for reapplication will be considered only where evidence of medical examination indicates a change of medical condition which could influence the board's decision.

ARTICLE XI
Amendment and Termination
Section 1. Amendment of the plan.
The governing authority shall have the right at any time, and from time to time, to amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the plan following the review and recommendation by the pension board; provided, however, that no such amendment shall:
A.
Reduce the accrued benefits of any participant or beneficiary, or
B.
Authorize or permit any part of the trust fund held by the provider to be diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of participants and their beneficiaries, and
C.
No amendment shall operate to deprive any participant or beneficiary of any rights or benefits irrevocably vested in him under the plan prior to such amendment except that the governing authority may make any and all changes and modifications necessary to qualify the plan or to keep the plan qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder, or any amendment thereto.
Section 2. Termination of the plan.
A.
The city expects the plan to be continued indefinitely but, of necessity, reserves the right to terminate the plan and contributions thereunder at any time by action of the governing authority. Upon receipt of written notice from the governing authority of termination of the plan, the provider shall prepare a list of all participants showing for each, as of the date of plan termination, the following:
1.
For each retired participant and beneficiary receiving payment of benefits, the amount and terms of payment of such benefits.
2.
For each terminated participant entitled to a deferred benefit, the amount, commencement date, and terms of payment of such benefit.
3.
For each active participant the amount of his accrued benefit.
B.
The provider shall arrange for the liquidation of all assets held in the trust fund maintained in connection with the plan and shall prepare a statement of the liquidated value of such assets. The governing authority, in its sole discretion, may direct the provider to purchase from an insurance company an annuity contract or contracts which provide the benefits to which each participant or beneficiary is entitled or to pay a lump sum to each participant or beneficiary, such lump sum amount to be actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which such participant or beneficiary is entitled.
C.
The provider shall then deduct from the assets total remaining expenses incurred or to be incurred by the provider in behalf of the plan. The provider shall except as otherwise provided in this Section 2 then allocate the remaining assets for distribution in accordance with the classes listed below. The benefits of each class shall be satisfied before proceeding to the next class. If at any time the remaining plan assets would be insufficient to provide the accrued benefits for the class in question, the remaining assets would be applied on a pro rata basis within that class, and all subsequent classes would receive no benefit.
Class 1—Retired participants or beneficiaries who are receiving payments on the termination date.
Class 2—Participants delaying retirement.
Class 3—Participants eligible for early retirement.
Class 4—Former employees who are terminated participants.
Class 5—All other participants on a pro rata basis.
D.
Upon distribution of the assets as specified above, the plan shall be regarded as terminated and no participant or beneficiary shall have any further rights or claim therein.
E.
The city hereby terminates the 4022 plan for general employees and any contributions thereunder as there are no employees actively at work currently remaining under the plan. All employees covered by the 4022 plan are in the public safety portion of the plan, and that portion of the plan and any contributions thereunder remains in full force and effect. The city shall notify the provider with written notice that the 4022 plan for general employees has been terminated. The employees shall have no further rights or claim to the 4022 plan for general employees.

Miscellaneous
Section 1. Construction.
A.
In the construction of the plan all masculine shall include the feminine and the singular the plural in all cases where such meanings would be appropriate.
B.
The plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia.
C.
In the event that any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this agreement shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the previously existing provisions or the other section or sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase so declared or adjudicated invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The governing authority hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this agreement or retained the previously existing provisions if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudicated invalid or unconstitutional.
Section 2. Non-alienation of benefits.
None of the benefits, payments, proceeds, or distributions payable under the plan shall be subject to the claim of any creditor of any participant or to the claim of any creditor of any beneficiary hereunder, or to any legal process of levy or attachment by any creditor of any such participant or beneficiary; and no such benefits shall be in any manner liable for or subject to the debts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of any participant or beneficiary, and neither any such participant or beneficiary shall have any right to alienate, commute, anticipate, transfer, encumber, pledge or assign any of the benefits, payments proceeds, or distributions under the plan. If any participant or beneficiary shall become bankrupt or attempt to anticipate, assign or pledge any benefits, then such benefits shall, in the discretion of the pension board, cease, and in that event the pension board shall have authority to cause the same, or any part thereof, to be held or applied to or for the benefit of such member, his spouse, his children, or other dependents, or any of them, in such manner and in such proportion as the pension board may think proper.
Section 3. Legally incompetent.
Any participant or beneficiary receiving or claiming benefits under the plan shall be conclusively presumed to be mentally competent and of age until the pension board receives a written notice, in a form and manner acceptable to it, that such person is incompetent or a minor, and that a guardian or other person legally vested with the care of his estate has been appointed. In the event that the pension board finds that any person to whom a benefit is payable under the plan is unable to properly care for his affairs, or is a minor, then any payment due (unless a prior claim therefor shall have been made by a duly appointed legal representative) may be paid to the spouse, a child, a parent, or a brother or sister, or to any person deemed by the pension board to have incurred expense for such person otherwise entitled to payment. In the event a guardian of the estate of any person receiving or claiming benefits under the plan shall be appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, payments shall be made to such guardian provided that proper proof of appointment is furnished in a form and manner suitable to the pension board. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of liability therefor under the plan.
Section 4. Benefits supported only by trust fund.
Any person having any claim under the plan will look solely to the assets of the trust fund for satisfaction. In no event will the city, or any of its employees or agents, be liable in their individual capacities to any person whomsoever, under the provisions of the plan.
Section 5. Discrimination.
The city, through the pension board, shall administer the plan in a uniform and consistent manner with respect to all participants and shall not permit discrimination in favor of supervisory or highly paid employees, elected or appointed members of the governing authority, the chief legal officer or any associate legal officer of the city, or any municipal officer elected or appointed to preside over the court of said city.
Section 6. Limitation of liability; legal actions.
A.
It is expressly understood and agreed by each employee who becomes a participant hereunder that, except for its or their willful neglect or fraud, neither the city, the pension board, nor the provider shall be in any way subject to any suit or litigation, or to any legal liability, for any cause or reason or thing whatsoever, in connection with the plan or its operation, and each such participant hereby releases the city, all its employees and agents, the pension board, and the provider from any and all liability or obligation.
B.
To any action or proceeding involving any rights under the plan or the proper administration thereof, the city and the pension board shall be the only necessary parties and no participant, or his beneficiary, or any other persons having or claiming to have an interest in the plan shall be entitled to any notice or process. Any final judgment which is not appealed or appealable that may be entered in any such action or proceeding shall be binding and conclusive on the parties hereto and all persons having or claiming to have an interest in the plan.
Section 7. Claims.
Any payment to a participant, or beneficiary, or to their legal representatives, in accordance with the provisions of the plan, shall to the extent thereof be in full satisfaction of all claims hereunder against the pension board or the city, either of which may require such participant, beneficiary, or legal representative, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and release therefor in such form as shall be determined by the pension board or the city, as the case may be.
Section 8. Application for benefits.
Any provision in the plan to the contrary notwithstanding, benefits may become payable only after the participant, beneficiary, or their legal representative, whichever is applicable, has made written application therefor to the pension board. Benefits for which no such application has been made within three (3) years following the date of entitlement to such benefits shall be forfeited. In no event shall any forfeitures be applied to increase the benefits any participant or beneficiary would otherwise receive under this plan.
Section 9. Forfeiture for certain crimes.
A.
Participation in the plan for any employee in service on July 1, 1985, who is convicted of a public employment related crime (as defined in O.C.G.A. § 47-1-20) on or after July 1, 1985, in the capacity of an employee, shall terminate on the date of final conviction in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 47-1-21.
B.
Benefits under this plan for any employee hired or rehired after July 1, 1985, who is convicted of a public employment related crime in his or her capacity as an employee (as provided in O.C.G.A. § 47-1-22), including any survivor's benefits if applicable, shall be reduced by an amount equal to three times the economic impact of the crime, upon final conviction. Payment of such benefits shall cease until such amount has been forfeited, after which benefits shall be restored. If the person has not begun to receive a benefit, the deduction shall commence at the time such benefits would normally begin. For purposes of this subsection, the term "benefits" shall not include a refund of employee contributions without interest.
C.
Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any employee hired or rehired after July 1, 1990, who is not vested under the plan and who is convicted of a drug-related crime (as defined in O.C.G.A. § 47-1-20) shall forfeit all rights and benefits under and membership in the plan, effective on the date of final conviction. Any employee contributions made by any such employee shall be reimbursed, without interest, to the employee within 60 days after the date of final conviction for the commission of the drug-related crime. If an employee who is vested under the plan commits a drug-related crime, such employee's active membership in the plan shall terminate on the date of final conviction.
D.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to create a right for the employee who is charged with the commission of a public employment or drug-related crime to accrue rights or benefits under this plan after the date the employee ceases to be a member of the plan.
E.
Within 30 days following the day the pension board receives notice that a member of the retirement system has a final conviction for a public employment-related crime, the pension board shall initiate proceedings in the Office of State Administrative Hearings, under the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 47-1-25 and O.C.G.A. § 50-2-13, to determine the economic impact of the employment related crime. The State Department of Law shall represent the pension board in such proceedings. The decision of the administrative law judge shall be final unless appeal is made as otherwise provided by law.
F.
For purposes of this Section 9, a final conviction does not include circumstances under which a first offender is exonerated from guilt and discharged as a matter of law after successful completion of sentencing.
G.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 9 to the contrary and to the extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to employees hired or rehired after July 1, 1985, who committed a public employment related crime before July 1, 2008, the city reserves the right to require forfeiture of all rights and benefits under the plan in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 47-1-22(b) in effect prior to July 1, 2008.

ARTICLE XIV
Maximum Benefits [5]
Section 14.01. General rule.
The annual benefit payable under this plan to a participant at any time shall not exceed the maximum permissible amount. "Maximum permissible amount" shall mean $90,000.00 ($160,000.00, effective for limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2002), as adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for each calendar year, with the new limitation to apply to limitation years ending within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment (the "dollar limitation").
Section 14.02. Reduction for less than ten years of participation or employment.
If the annual benefit commences when the participant has less than ten years of participation in this plan or any predecessor plan to this plan, the dollar limitation shall be reduced by one-tenth for each year less than ten, but in no event shall be less than one-tenth of the unreduced dollar limitation.
Section 14.03. Adjustment if the annual benefit commences before age 62 or after age 65.
If the payment of benefits under this plan commences before age 62 or after age 65, the dollar limitation shall be adjusted as provided in this section 14.03.
Generally, the age-adjusted dollar limitation is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation payable at age 62 or age 65, as calculated under (i) or (ii) following, whichever is applicable:
(i)
If the age at which the benefit is payable is less than 62: First, reduce the dollar limitation using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factors, as applicable, which are set forth in the plan for the reduction of benefits for early retirement benefits under the plan. Second, reduce the dollar limitation using 5 percent interest and the applicable mortality table. Use the lesser of the amounts determined under the two preceding sentences as the age-adjusted dollar limitation under this paragraph (i). For limitation years beginning before january 1, 2002, nothing in this paragraph shall reduce the applicable dollar limitation below $75,000.00 if the annual benefit begins at or after age 55. Also for limitation years beginning before january 1, 2002, if the annual benefit begins before age 55, nothing in this paragraph shall reduce the dollar limitation below the actuarial equivalent of the $75,000.00 limitation for age 55.
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if a participant is a "qualified participant" (e.g., certain police and firefighters) as defined under Code Section 415(b)(2)(G), such participant may retire before age sixty-two (62), without a reduction in the dollar limitation if at least fifteen (15) years of service is required to receive a full benefit under the plan.
(ii)
If the age at which the benefit is payable is greater than age 65: The age-adjusted dollar limitation is determined by increasing the dollar limitation on an actuarially equivalent basis. The increased age-adjusted dollar limitation shall be the lesser of the equivalent amount computed using the interest rate and mortality table set forth in Appendix F that is used for actuarial equivalence for delayed retirement benefit under the plan and the equivalent amount computed using 5 percent interest and the applicable mortality table.
Section 14.04. Special rules.
(a)
All plans a single plan. For purposes of the maximum limitations of this article, all defined benefit plans maintained by the employer shall be considered as a single defined benefit plan, and all defined contribution plans maintained by the employer shall be considered a single defined contribution plan.
(b)
Combined plan limitations. If the employer maintains, or has any time maintained, one or more qualified defined contribution plans covering any participant in this plan, the sum of the participant's defined contribution fraction and defined benefit fraction shall not exceed 1.0 in any limitation year, and the annual benefit otherwise payable to the participant under this plan, and not the defined contribution plan, shall be frozen or reduced to the extent necessary so that the sum of such fractions shall not exceed 1.0. The combined plan limitation described in the preceding sentence shall not apply for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2000.
(c)
Total annual benefits not in excess of $10,000.00. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the annual benefit payable to a participant shall not be deemed to exceed the limits of this article XIV if the annual benefit payable to the participant under this plan and all other defined benefit plans maintained by the employer does not exceed $10,000.00 for the plan year or any prior plan year, and the employer has not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan in which the participant participated.
(d)
Exceptions for disability or survivors' benefits. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the adjustment prescribed by section 14.03(i) for benefits that commence before age 62, and the reduction described in section 14.02 for fewer than ten (10) years of participation shall not apply to any benefit paid from this plan on account of a participant's becoming disabled by reason of personal injuries or sickness, or amounts received by a beneficiary as a result of the participant's death. This paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 415(b)(2)(I) and any regulations thereunder.
(e)
Periods prior to 1995. For limitation years beginning before January 1, 1995, the limitations prescribed by Section 415 of the Code, to the extent that they apply to governmental plans, are incorporated herein by reference as of the latest date by which such provisions (if the effective date is elective) may be applied.
Section 14.05. Definitions.
For purposes of this article XIV, the following definitions shall apply:
(a)
Annual additions means the sum of the following amounts credited to a participant's account under a defined contribution plan for the limitation year:
(i)
Employer contributions;
(ii)
Forfeitures;
(iii)
Nondeductible employee contributions; provided, however, that the annual addition for any limitation year beginning before January 1, 1987, shall not be recomputed to treat nondeductible employee contributions as an annual addition; and
(iv)
Amounts described in Code Sections 415(l)(1) and 419A(d)(2).
(b)
Annual benefit means a retirement benefit under the plan which is payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity. If a participant's benefit is payable in a non-annuity benefit form, whether as the normal form of benefit or as an optional form which the participant or his beneficiary elects, the non-annuity benefit form is adjusted to an annual benefit as described below. No actuarial adjustment to the non-annuity benefit form is required for (i) the value of a qualified joint and survivor annuity; (ii) the value of benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a disability benefit, pre-retirement death benefits, and post-retirement medical benefits); or (iii) the value of post-retirement cost-of-living increases made in accordance with Treasury Regulations.
To convert a non-annuity benefit form to an annual benefit (i.e., a straight life annuity), first convert the non-annuity benefit form to a straight life annuity using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factors, as applicable, which are specified in the plan for the non-annuity benefit form. Second, convert the non-annuity benefit form to an annual benefit using a 5 percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table. The greater of the amounts determined under the two preceding sentences is the equivalent annual benefit.
(c)
Applicable mortality table is the table prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury in Revenue Ruling 95-6 or any successor thereto which prescribes the mortality table to be applied pursuant to Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). To the extent that a forfeiture does not occur upon death, the mortality decrement may be ignored prior to age 62 and must be ignored after Social Security retirement age, as prescribed by IRS Notice 83-10, Q&A G-3 and Q&A G-4, or any successor thereto.
(d)
Compensation means the participant's earned income within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.415-2(d), as limited by Code Section 401(a)(17) and subject, for Limitation Years beginning prior to January 1, 1997, to the family aggregation rules described in article II, section 24, the definition of "earnings".
(e)
Defined benefit fraction means a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the participant's projected annual benefits under all the defined benefit plans (whether or not terminated) maintained by the employer, and the denominator of which is the lesser of (i) 125 percent of the dollar limitation in effect for the limitation year under Code Section 415(b)(1)(A); or (ii) 140 percent of the participant's highest average compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the participant was a participant in a plan maintained by the employer and in existence on July 1, 1982, the denominator of this fraction shall not be less than 125 percent of the sum of the annual benefits under such plans which the participant had accrued as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before January 1, 1983, but determined without regard to changes in the plan or cost-of-living increases occurring after July 1, 1982. The preceding sentence applies only if the defined benefit plans individually and in the aggregate satisfied the requirements of Code Section 415 for all limitation years beginning before January 1, 1983.
(f)
Defined contribution fraction means a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the annual additions to the participant's account under all the defined contribution plans (whether or not terminated) maintained by the employer for the current and all prior limitation years, and the denominator of which is the sum of the maximum aggregate amounts for the current and all prior limitation years of employment with the employer (regardless of whether a defined contribution plan was maintained by the employer).
The maximum aggregate amount in any limitation year is the lesser of (i) 125 percent of the dollar limitation in effect under Code Section 415(c)(1)(A); or (ii) 35 percent of the participant's compensation for such year.
If the employee was a participant in one or more defined contribution plans maintained by the employer which were in existence on July 1, 1982, the numerator of this fraction shall be adjusted if the sum of this fraction and the defined benefit fraction would otherwise exceed 1.0 under the terms of this plan. Under the adjustment, an amount equal to the product of (1) the excess of the sum of the fractions over 1.0 times and (2) the denominator of this fraction, will be permanently subtracted from the numerator of this fraction. The adjustment is calculated using the fractions as they would be computed as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before January 1, 1983.
(g)
Employer means the City of Marietta, Georgia, or the Marietta Board of Lights and Water.
(h)
Limitation year means the plan year.
(i)
Non-annuity benefit form means a benefit, whether a normal form or an optional form, which is not payable in a straight life annuity for the life of the participant.
(j)
Projected annual benefit means the annual benefit to which the participant would be entitled under the terms of the plan assuming (i) the participant will continue employment until normal retirement age under the plan (or current age, if later), and (ii) the participant's compensation for the current limitation year and all other relevant factors used to determine benefits under the plan will remain constant for all future limitation years.
Appendix "A"
The amount of the monthly retirement benefit for service rendered as an eligible employee of the city for purposes of article V, section 1a.2(b) shall be determined as one-twelfth (1/12th) of the sum of (1) and (2) below.
1.
Past service—One and one-tenth percent (1.1%) of the final average earnings up to the amount of covered compensation applicable to the participant, plus 2.1% (for participants who terminate active service prior to the effective date of this change, the benefit percentage will remain 2%) of final average earnings in excess of the covered compensation applicable to the participant, multiplied by the total years of credited past service.
2.
Future service—One and one-tenth percent (1.1%) of the final average earnings up to the amount of covered compensation applicable to the participant, plus 2.1% (for participants who terminate active service prior to the effective date of this change, the benefit percentage will remain 2%) of final average earnings in excess of the covered compensation applicable to the participant, multiplied by the total years of credited future service plus credit granted pursuant to article II, section 45.
Applicable covered compensation as used in (1) and (2) above shall be determined as follows: For participants who retire or terminate vested in a plan year, covered compensation will be based on that participant's year of attaining normal retirement age.
For purposes of an example only, the following tables are attached hereto as an illustration of the covered compensation tables that will be prepared by the provider or the actuary whichever is directed to do so by the pension board. There will be two tables prepared. In the examples, Table A will be used for Level I employees and Table B will be used for Level II employees. As noted in the new definition of covered compensation, these tables will be updated annually and the tables attached to this ordinance are for purposes of illustration only. If a participant retires or terminates vested in a plan year, you will first determine the year that the participant retires or terminates vested. You will then determine the participant's year of birth which will relate to the year the participant would reach normal retirement age.
Level I example:
Using Table "A" that is provided as an illustration, if a Level I participant retires in 1985 and was born in 1939 and therefore will reach age 55 in 1994, the applicable covered compensation would be $20,436. This example is applicable to a Level I participant that retires, early retires or terminates vested.
Level II example:
Using Table "B" that is provided as an illustration, if a Level II participant has terminated vested in 1984 and was born in 1931, the applicable covered compensation would be $21,852.

Editor's note— Section 2 of Ord. No. 5922, deleted App. B of § 4-12-4-010, which pertained to early retirement reduction factors and derived from Ord. No. 4022, adopted Feb. 8, 1984; and Ord. No. 4106, adopted Nov. 14, 1984.
Appendix "C"
Calculation of Benefits Under Social Security Option
The following tables should be used to determine the social security adjustment option benefit. The benefit is an increased monthly benefit payable from retirement date to the commencement of social security, and decreased benefits after such date. The amount of the increased benefit is equal to (a) the monthly benefit the participant would have received at that retirement age, plus (b) his social security amount multiplied by a percentage from Table A-1. If the above amount so determined is less than the participant's social security amount, then the increased benefit is equal to (a) the monthly benefit the participant would have received at that retirement age, multiplied by (b) the appropriate percentage from Table A-2. It should be noted that the participants' expected social security benefit will be determined from tables supplied by the provider. The following examples illustrate how these tables should be applied for both general employees and policemen/firemen.
Example 1:
Policemen/firemen
Normal retirement age: 55
Actual retirement age: 55
Monthly benefit at NRA: $500
Estimated primary social security amount at age 62: $475
Social security commencement date: At age 62
Increased benefit up to age 62: $500 + (.628) $475 = $798
Reduced benefit after age 62: $798-$475 = $323 **
*Early retirement factor
**The reduced benefit at age 62 will be adjusted with the same percentage COLA increases that occurred from actual retirement.

  Calculation of Death Benefits:
The above table should be used to determine the number of monthly payments any designated beneficiary should receive under article VII, section 2.
If the participant is 56 years of age or older at the time of death, and has already received monthly retirement benefits, the number of monthly retirement benefits received prior to death shall be deducted from the total number of monthly payments expected to be received at retirement age. The remaining number will represent the total number of monthly benefits for the designated beneficiary.
For purposes of calculating benefits under this table, any participant shall be deemed to be not less than 56 years of age at retirement, regardless of when the participant actually retired or became eligible for any retirement benefits. However, in the event the actual age of the participant is less than 56 at retirement, there shall be no deduction for monthly payments actually received by the participant.
Notwithstanding the table set forth in this Appendix "E", any designated beneficiary shall receive a minimum of 24 monthly death benefits following the death of the retiree.
Example: If a participant retires at age 61, his expected number of monthly retirement benefits is 160.10. This figure is rounded off to 160 and represents the total number of monthly payments the participant is expected to receive at retirement. If the participant dies after 8 years and 5 months (101 payments), the designated beneficiary would receive the remaining number of monthly benefits, same being 59 months (160 - 101 = 59).

Masculine pronouns, when used throughout the plan, shall refer to both men and women, and the singular shall include the plural, unless the context indicates otherwise. Headings of sections are used for convenience of reference, and in the case of conflict, the text of the plan, rather than such headings, shall control.
Section 1. Actuarial present value.
Unless otherwise specified in the plan, the actuarial present value of a benefit shall be determined using the interest rate prescribed by the pension benefit guaranty corporation for valuing annuities under the single-employer plans that terminate without a notice of sufficiency during the first month of the calendar year in which the date as of which the benefit is valued, occurs. The mortality assumption shall be based on the 1971 Group Annuity Mortality Table, weighted as follows:
(a)
For a participant's benefit, 80% male and 20% female;
(b)
For the benefit of a participant's spouse or former spouse, 20% male and 80% female; and
(c)
In any other case, 50% male and 50% female.
Actuarial equivalence means two benefits of equal actuarial present value based on the factors and assumptions specified in the provisions in which that phrase is used or, if not otherwise specified, based on the assumptions described in this section.
Notwithstanding the first paragraph hereof, effective January 1, 2002, unless otherwise specified in the plan, the actuarial present value of a benefit shall be determined using the interest rate or rates published by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for lump sum calculations for private-sector calculations (as described in PBGC Reg. Sec. 4022.7), as in effect as of the first day of the plan year in which a distribution occurs.

The submission of a new beneficiary designation shall automatically revoke all prior beneficiary designations. If a participant does not have an effective beneficiary designation on file, his beneficiary shall be his spouse, if he is married as of the date of his death, or his estate, if he is not married on the date of his death.

If the beneficiary receives such a refund, no additional death benefits will be paid from the plan.
A refund of a participant contribution account shall not include interest.
"Beneficiary" for purposes of this section 3 shall mean the individual, trust or other entity designated by the participant in accordance with procedures established by the pension board to receive a distribution of the participant's participant contribution account under the circumstances described above.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event may distribution of a participant's retirement benefit commence later than the first day of April in the calendar year following the later of (a) the calendar year in which the participant attains age 70½, or (b) the calendar year in which the participant retires. If, as of January 1, 2002, a participant is an employee in active employment with the employer and is receiving distributions on account of his attaining age 70½, the participant shall continue to receive plan distributions. A participant or beneficiary who would have been required to receive required minimum distributions for 2009 but for the enactment of Code Section 401(a)(9)(H) shall not receive those distributions for 2009 unless the participant or beneficiary chooses to receive such distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, any required minimum distribution made in 2009 shall be treated as eligible rollover distribution.
The following rules shall apply for purposes of determining the required minimum distribution to participants and designated beneficiaries (as defined below) for calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 2003, even if, in the case of a designated beneficiary, the participant died before 2003.
(a)
Required distribution. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan. This section 7 shall, instead, be deemed to limit and modify any provision of this plan to the extent that such limitation or modification is necessary to ensure that the plan complies with this section 7, Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder.
The entire interest of each participant in this plan will be distributed, beginning not later than the required beginning date described above, over the life of such participant or over the lives of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant or the life expectancy of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary.
(b)
Death of participant after distribution has begun. If distribution of a participant's interest has begun in accordance with the paragraph (a) above (i.e., distributions on or after the required beginning date), and if the participant dies before his or her entire interest has been distributed to him, then the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under paragraph (a) as of the date of the participant's death.
(c)
Death of participant before distribution has begun. If a participant dies before distribution of the participant's interest has begun in accordance with paragraph (a) above (i.e., no distributions have been made on or after the required beginning date), the entire interest of the participant must be paid over whichever of the following periods is applicable:
(i)
If one or more designated beneficiary is not the participant's spouse, the distribution period shall be the designated beneficiary's remaining life expectancy.
(ii)
If the sole designated beneficiary is the participant's spouse, the distribution period shall be the spouse's remaining life expectancy.
(iii)
If there is no designated beneficiary, the entire benefit (if any is payable) shall be distributed by the end of the calendar year that includes the fifth anniversary of the participant's death.
Distributions under paragraph (c)(i)—(iii) above shall commence as follows:
(x)
Distributions under (c)(i) (i.e., distribution to a nonspouse designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the end of the calendar year that begins immediately after the calendar year in which the participant died.
(y)
Distributions under (c)(ii) (i.e., distribution to a spousal designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the later of the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died and the end of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 70½.
(d)
Form of distribution. Any distribution payable under this section 7 may be paid in any optional form of benefit that is available under the plan, provided that all consent and eligibility requirements under the plan are satisfied. Any annuity form of distribution payable under this plan, however, must satisfy the following requirements:
(i)
The distribution must be in the form of a periodic annuity for the participant's life, or for the joint life expectancy of the participant and designated beneficiary or over a period certain that does not exceed the maximum length of the period certain determined under the regulations.
(ii)
The interval between payments must be uniform over the entire distribution period and must not exceed one year.
(iii)
If payments have commenced over a period certain, the period certain may not be changed.
(iv)
Distributions in the form of a life annuity must satisfy the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6T, A-2, or any successor regulation thereto.
(v)
All payments, either in the form of a life annuity or over a period certain must either be nonincreasing or increase only in accordance with the rules set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6T, A-1.
For purposes of this section 7, references to a life annuity shall include an annuity for the joint life expectancy of the participant and the designated beneficiary.
(e)
Incidental death benefit requirement. Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant or designated beneficiary must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G). This rule insures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental.
(f)
Pension board's discretion. The pension board for the city shall have the sole authority and full discretion to apply the provisions of this section 7 to any benefit option elected by the participant or designated beneficiary. The plan administrator may, for example, modify a participant's selection of an optional form of benefit to satisfy the incidental death benefit requirement by requiring, at its discretion, that the participant select another form of benefit or another contingent annuitant, or by modifying the form of benefit so that it complies with the applicable rules.
(g)
Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this section 7, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary.
(i)
Designated beneficiary. The term "designated beneficiary" shall be determined in accordance with the definition of "beneficiary" in the regulations, notwithstanding that this definition may be different from that set forth elsewhere in this plan, provided that any individual who is a designated beneficiary must also be a beneficiary (but not necessarily all of the beneficiaries) as defined in this plan. Each beneficiary, as defined in the plan, however, need not be a designated beneficiary in the event, for example, that a beneficiary disclaims his interest under this plan.
(ii)
Spouse. "Spouse" shall mean "Spouse" as defined in the Regulations. Nothing in this section 7 shall be deemed, however, to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan.
(iii)
Regulations. "Regulations" shall refer to the Treasury Regulations (including temporary regulations) promulgated under Code Section 401(a)(9), as set forth in Treasury Regulations 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-6T, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS in the form of revenue rulings, notices and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or any successor thereto.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, distributions from the plan will be made in accordance with a good faith interpretation of Code Subsection 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder as applicable to governmental plans with the meaning of Code Section 414(d) and shall be implemented in accordance with the grandfathering provisions of such regulations applicable to annuity option distributions in effect on April 17, 2001.

Section 8. Amount of late retirement benefit.
The monthly amount of the late retirement benefit shall be equal to the benefit determined in section 2 of this article.
Section 9. Eligibility for a vested retirement benefit.
A terminated participant shall be eligible to retire and receive a vested retirement benefit if his employment with the employer terminates voluntarily or involuntarily for any reason other than death, normal, early, or disability retirement, provided he has completed at least five years of credited service if hired prior to March 18, 2008, at least seven years of credited service if hired on or after March 18, 2008 through December 31, 2008, or at least ten years of service if hired after January 1, 2009.
A participant whose employment is terminated voluntarily or involuntarily because he is disabled shall be entitled to a vested benefit provided he qualifies for a disability retirement, (in accordance with section 11 of this article), within one year of termination of employment. Should a participant receiving workers' compensation benefits become qualified to receive disability retirement benefits on or after January 1, 2009, his disability retirement benefit will be reduced by the amount of workers' compensation benefit. Once the participant is ineligible for workers' compensation benefits, his total disability benefit will be restored.
Benefits shall commence on the first day of the month in which the terminated participant attains his normal retirement date. If an employee is a participant in the plan on March 1, 1987, and later terminates his employment with the employer, he shall be eligible to retire and commence receiving benefits on the first day of any month following his attainment of age 55, provided he has completed at least five years of credited service.
If an employee becomes a participant in the plan on or after March 18, 2008 through December 31, 2008, and later terminates his employment with the employer, he shall be eligible to retire and commence receiving benefits on the first day of any month following the attainment of age 55, provided he has completed seven years of credited service.
If an employee becomes a participant in the plan on or after January 1, 2009, and later terminates his employment with the employer, he shall be eligible to retire and commence receiving benefits on the first day of any month following the attainment of age 55, provided he has completed ten years of credited service.
In the event a participant is involuntarily terminated for reasons other than willful misconduct, he shall be eligible to retire at any time after attaining his early retirement date, provided he has at least 20 years of credited service on the date he terminates his employment.
(Ord. No. 7142, 3/17/2008, § 1; Ord. No. 7234, 9/10/2008, § 1; Ord. No. 7274, 12/10/2008, § 1)
Section 10. Amount of vested retirement benefit.
The monthly amount of the vested retirement benefit shall be equal to benefit determined in section 2 of this article, based on the benefit rate in effect at the time the former participant terminated his employment.
Section 11. Eligibility for a disability retirement benefit.
A participant shall be eligible to retire on a disability retirement benefit if he becomes disabled, as defined in section 6 of article II. If the disability is non-job related, the participant must have completed at least 12 months of continuous service. Continuous service shall be defined in the same manner as "Service" under section 24 of article II.
(Ord. No. 7669, 7/10/2013, § 1)
Section 12. Amount of disability retirement benefit.
The monthly amount of the disability retirement benefit shall be determined in accordance with Section 2 of this article. In no event, however, shall the benefit be less than 50 percent of the average of the participant's most recent 12 months of earnings. If the employee has completed an initial 12 months of continuous service, from date of hire to date of termination of employment as a result of a disability, but has less than 12 months of monthly earnings, the disability retirement benefit shall be no less than 50 percent of the average monthly earnings for the actual number of months worked. Continuous service shall be defined in the same manner as "Service" section 24 of article II.
Should a participant receiving workers' compensation benefits become qualified to receive disability retirement benefits on or after March 18, 2008, his disability retirement benefit will be reduced by the amount of workers' compensation benefit. Once the participant is ineligible for workers' compensation benefits, his total disability benefit will be restored.
(Ord. No. 6465, 11/13/2002, § 2; Ord. No. 7234, 9/10/2008, § 1; Ord. No. 7669, 7/10/2013, § 2)
Section 13. Evidence of disability.
Participants applying for disability retirement must provide such evidence of disability in writing on a form provided by the city, which shall substantiate a claim of disability as set forth in section 6 of article II. When an application for disability pension is filed, the applicant shall submit therewith a signed certificate from a licensed, practicing physician certifying to the total disability of such applicant for a pension under the terms required in section 6 of article II, on a form provided by the city. Such form(s) must be completed in full and include all the information required by such form(s). The pension board may accept such completed form(s) or may order the applicant to be examined by a physician named by the pension board who likewise shall certify the physical ability or total disability, if found, of the applicant under the terms required in section 6 of article II. The pension board shall pay the cost of such additional examination. If the certificates of the respective physicians generally agree upon total disability, such facts shall be conclusive as to the physical or mental condition of the applicant and the pension board shall enter an order granting a disability pension in the proper amount. If the certificate tendered by the applicant and the certification of the physician appointed by the pension board shall disagree as to the condition of the applicant, the pension board shall review the documentation related to the request for disability and shall render a determination as to the disability of the applicant. If the applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the pension board, the participant shall request and the pension board shall conduct a hearing for the purpose of reviewing the application on appeal. Such hearing shall be conducted informally by the examination of witnesses for and in opposition to such application, and both the applicant and the pension board may be represented by legal counsel if they so desire. Any oral testimony shall be summarized in pension board minutes. Copies of documents may be received as evidence in lieu of the original at the discretion of the pension board, and affidavits shall be filed with the pension board at the time of the hearing. The decision of the pension board after a hearing shall be final as to the physical or mental condition of the applicant; provided, however, any person dissatisfied with the decision of the pension board after such hearing may appeal that decision to council in accordance with section 4 of article X. The applicant shall be entitled to present to council all documents reviewed by the pension board and testimony given during the hearing in making its determination during such final appeal. Council may consider only evidence submitted, heard or considered by the pension board.
At least once every two years after the pension board approves the applicant's disability retirement, or sooner if specifically requested by the pension board, the applicant must furnish evidence to the pension board of his or her ongoing disability as defined in section 6 of article II, in writing, on a form provided by the city. When the form for an ongoing disability pension is filed, the applicant shall submit therewith a signed certificate from a licensed, practicing physician certifying to the ongoing disability of such applicant for a pension on a form provided by the city under the terms required in section 6 of article II. Such form(s) must be completed in full and include all the information required by such form(s) within 30 days of the earlier of the second anniversary of the pension board's approval of such employee's initial or ongoing disability or the date requested by the pension board. Provided, however, if such participant receiving disability benefits does not provide evidence of and provide all of the information required by the city to show an ongoing disability within such 30-day period defined above, the pension board shall withhold payments of his benefits until he submits the required forms and the participant shall be deemed to have forfeited his benefits during the time of his refusal to submit such required forms. Should the refusal continue for a period of six months, or the participant's physician cannot certify to the participant's ongoing disability, such disability pension shall end and be terminated.
The pension board shall have the right to require an examination of any and all participants receiving disability pensions under the provisions of this section once every two years by a physician named by the pension board. The pension board shall pay the cost of such additional examination. If any such participant receiving a disability pension shall be found, as a result of such examination, to no longer be disabled in accordance with section 6 of article II, the pension board may, after hearing evidence thereon, and after giving an opportunity to such participant to be heard, remove such participant from the list of those entitled to disability pension. If the applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the pension board, the participant shall request and the pension board shall conduct a hearing for the purpose of reviewing the application for ongoing disability, in appeal. Such hearing shall be conducted informally by the examination of witnesses for and in opposition to such application, and both the applicant and pension board may be represented by legal counsel if they so desire. Any oral testimony shall be summarized in pension board minutes. Copies of documents may be received as evidence in lieu of the original at the discretion of the pension board, and affidavits shall be filed with the pension board at the time of the hearing. The decision of the pension board after a hearing shall be final as to the physical or mental condition of the applicant; provided however any person dissatisfied with the decision of the pension board after such hearing may appeal that decision to council in accordance with section 4 of article X. The applicant shall be entitled to present to council all documents reviewed by the pension board and testimony given during the hearing in making its determination during such final appeal. Council may consider only evidence submitted, heard or considered by the pension board.
Provided, however, that in the event a participant receiving disability benefits refuses to submit to a physical examination or does not cooperate with and complete the examination conducted by the physician as requested by the pension board pursuant to this section after 30 days' notice to report for such examination, the pension board shall withhold payments of his benefits until he submits to such examination. The participant shall be deemed to have forfeited his benefits during the time of his refusal to submit to a physical examination. Should the refusal continue for a period of six months, such disability pension shall end and be terminated and can only be reinstated if the participant reapplies for a disability pension in accordance with this section.
(Ord. No. 7669, 7/10/2013, § 3)
Section 14. Termination of disability retirement benefit.
A period of total disability ceases on the earliest of the following dates:
A.
The date the participant ceases to be totally disabled;
B.
The date the participant commences work at a reasonable occupation for which the employee may be engaged or may reasonably become engaged, fitted by education, training or experience;
C.
The date the participant fails to furnish proof of the continuance of total disability or refuses to be examined when required;
D.
The date the participant ceases to be under the care of a physician, or
E.
The date of the participant's death.
Section 15. Successive period of disability.
Notwithstanding the fact that a participant may initially be determined disabled, and subsequently have disability retirement benefits terminated because of the occurrence of any event set forth in section 14 of this article, said participant may continue to be eligible for a successive period of disability benefits, if the participant is later determined disabled again as provided under section 13 of this article. The purpose of the successive disabilities rule is to encourage the participant to return to full-time work by assuring if the disability occurs again due to the same or related cause soon after returning to work, the participant will not have to complete a new qualifying period in order to qualify for benefits.
Section 16. Definition of physician.
The term "physician" means a legally qualified physician, except that with respect to a period of total disability, or any portion thereof, during which total disability is caused by any condition other than a medically determinable physical impairment, "physician" shall mean a legally qualified physician who either specializes in the practice of psychiatric medicine or has by reason of training or experience, a specialized competency in the field of psychiatric medicine sufficient to render the necessary evaluation and treatment of mental illness. To be "legally qualified," an individual must be licensed to practice medicine as a physician under the governing law of his state, territory, or foreign country, and said license must be issued by the respective medical board. In Georgia, the physician must be licensed to practice in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 43-34-1 et seq., as amended.
(Ord. No. 7872, 3/9/2016, § 1)
Section 17. Nonduplication of benefits.
Nothing contained in this plan shall be construed as permitting any person to be entitled to more than one type of benefit under this plan or change the type of benefit elected once he has begun to receive benefit payments, unless otherwise specified in this plan.
Section 18. Return to employment after retirement.
A.
Reemployment. Any retirement benefit payable under this plan to any participant who has retired and commenced receiving benefits, shall be suspended as of the month in which he is reemployed as an eligible full-time employee or less than full-time employee if retired under the provisions of article V, section 11, by the employer. Benefits shall be resumed as of the first day of the month coinciding with or next following his subsequent retirement; said benefits shall be recalculated in accordance with this article on the basis of his aggregate credited service and final average earnings at the time of his subsequent retirement, but reduced on an actuarial basis by the value of any early retirement benefits received prior to being reemployed, provided that the resulting benefit shall not be less than the benefit payable at the time of this previous retirement.
B.
Election or appointment to the governing authority. If a participant is elected or appointed as a member of the governing authority after he has retired from employment in another capacity under this plan, he shall be eligible to earn credited service, after he has met the participation requirements for elected or appointed officials, as set forth in section 1 of article III. He shall be eligible to receive a normal retirement benefit as an elected or appointed official provided he has met the requirements as set forth in section 1 of article V. During the period in which said participant is holding an elected or appointed office with the governing authority, he shall continue to receive retirement benefits previously awarded under the plan, however, such benefits shall not be recalculated as a result of his employment as an elected or appointed official.
C.
Disability retirement. Any disability retirement benefit payable under this plan to any participant who shall have retired or been retired pursuant to any provision of section 2 of article V shall be suspended as of the date his disability ceases. In any case where the payment of a participant's disability retirement pension shall have been so suspended, said period of absence from employment due to such disability shall be treated as a leave of absence without pay, but shall not be counted toward future service. Any participant who shall have retired or been retired pursuant to the provisions of section 11 of article V and who does or who has been or shall be subsequently declared ineligible for a disability retirement benefit because of a cessation of said disability shall have a right to any benefit afforded under any other provision of this plan to which he might otherwise be entitled. In such a case any disability retirement payments made prior to the date his disability ceases or is declared to no longer exist shall be retained by the participant and disregarded in computing any other benefit payable under this plan.
(Ord. No. 6284, 9/12/2001, § 2)
ARTICLE VI
Crediting of Service and Break in Service
Section 1. General.
Service and credited service shall be granted to a participant for the purpose of determining such participant's vested percentage of his accrued benefit and for computing the amount of benefits payable under this plan.
Section 2. Past service.
A participant shall be entitled to receive past service and past credited service for the number of years and full months of continuous employment with the employer prior to November 1, 1973. Past service shall also be granted for any tenure of elected office of an elected or appointed member of the governing authority who was serving as an eligible employee or an elected or appointed official, or both, on November 1, 1973. Otherwise, past service shall not include any tenure of elective office as an elected or appointed member of the governing authority.
Section 3. Future service.
A participant shall earn future service and future credited service for the number of years and full months of continuous employment with the employer on and after November 1, 1973.
Elective or appointed members of the governing authority shall earn future service and future credited service for all periods of elected office, whether or not successive, however any break in his tenure of elective office will not be considered as a period of future service or future credited service.
Section 4. Break in service.
A.
General rule. A participant will incur a break in service upon his termination of employment with the employer. A participant who is vested upon termination of employment shall be eligible for a vested retirement benefit in accordance with section 9 of article V. A participant who is not vested upon termination of employment shall lose his service and credited service. However, if the participant later returns to work with the employer and, after such rehire, earns the number of years of continuous service required to earn a vested percentage for the vesting period in effect on the date of rehire, then, except to the extent described in B below in the case of a participant who received a refund of his participant contributions, his previous years of service, prior to January 1, 2009, and credited service prior to January 1, 2009, for which he did not make participant contributions, shall be restored.
B.
Participant received a refund of participant contributions. The rules set forth in this paragraph B shall apply to any participant who (1) has a termination of employment with the employer; (2) is rehired in a position in which he is or will be eligible to accrue a benefit under this plan; and (3) received, upon his original termination of employment, a refund of his participant contributions, pursuant to Article IV, Section 3(2). In such a case:
1.
If the participant is rehired as of a date that is within sixty (60) months of his original termination of employment, and subsequently attains vested status according to the vesting requirements in place at the time of rehire, the participant shall, upon his rehire date and for purposes of calculating both his vested percentage and the amount of any benefit payable under this plan (i.e., both retirement and disability benefit), receive credit for fifty percent (50%) of the service with which the participant was credited during the period that he made participant contributions.
2.
If the participant is rehired as of a date that is more than sixty (60) months after his original termination of employment, the participant shall not receive credit, for purposes of calculating the amount of any benefit payable under this plan, for the period of service earned during the period that he made participant contributions. Such a participant may, however, receive credit for vesting purposes under the rule set forth in Section 4.A above.
(Ord. No. 7301, 3/11/2009, § 1)
Section 5. Exceptions to break in service.
An exception to the break in service provisions shall be allowed and a grace period granted if the participant's failure to earn service is due to:
A.
An employee's absence from service by reasons of (1) her pregnancy, (2) birth of child of the employee, (3) placement of a child with the employee in connection with his or her adoption of the child, or (4) care for such child for a period beginning immediately after such birth or placement for reasons defined under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Such absence shall be credited as hours of employment up to the number of months allowed per incident pursuant to the FMLA. The time so credited shall be applied to the plan year in which such absence begins, if doing so will prevent the employee from incurring a break in service in that plan year; otherwise it shall be applied to the next plan year. FMLA may cover absences that are attributable to (1) the birth and care of the newborn child of the employee; (2) the placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; (3) the employee's care of an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; or (4) the employee's medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition, or (5) other FMLA-covered reasons;
B.
The employee's absence for the purpose of involuntary service in the Armed Forces of the United States;
C.
Disability, for which the employee is receiving a disability retirement benefit; or
D.
An authorized leave of absence, provided:
1.
The individual was regularly employed by the employer immediately prior to his leave of absence;
2.
The individual makes application for reemployment on or before the date of expiration of any leave of absence or within 90 days after he first becomes entitled to his discharge from military service; and
3.
The individual is reemployed as an eligible employee within ninety (90) days after such application.
(Ord. No. 7301, 3/11/2009, § 2)
Section 6. Vesting.
A participant hired prior to March 18, 2008, who is a full-time employee and who has completed at least five years of service shall have his credited service vested and the break in service rules as set forth in section 4 of this article shall not operate to deprive him of his accumulated service.
A participant who is a full-time employee hired on or after March 18, 2008 through December 31, 2008, and who has completed at least seven years of credited service shall have his credited service vested and the break in service rules as set forth in section 4 of this article shall not operate to deprive him of his accumulated credited service.
A participant who is a full-time employee hired on or after January 1, 2009, and who has completed at least ten years of credited service shall have his credited service vested and the break in service rules as set forth in section 4 of this article shall not operate to deprive him of his accumulated credited service.
(Ord. No. 4905, 6/12/91, § 3; Ord. No. 6284, 9/12/2001, § 4; Ord. No. 7142, 3/17/2008, § 1; Ord. No. 7274, 12/10/2008, § 1)
Section 7. Unused sick leave or military duty used in benefit calculation.
New retirees will be credited with additional service for benefit calculation purposes only (i.e. this additional credit will not be used to satisfy any eligibility criteria for plan benefits) for either unused sick leave or for active duty federal military service prior to becoming an employee of the City of Marietta/BLW whichever is greater, to a maximum of one year. Unused sick leave or military service will be granted for whole months only. Unused sick leave will be verified by the city/BLW. Proof of military service will require evidence of an honorable discharge. This provision only applies to active employees who apply for normal or unreduced early retirement (if applicable) after the effective date of this ordinance.
(Ord. No. 6339, 12/12/2001, § 5)
ARTICLE VII
Forms of Benefit Payment
Section 1. Normal form of payment.
The normal form of benefit payment shall be a single life benefit, payable monthly to the retired participant. Benefits will cease as of the month in which the participant's death occurs.
Section 2. Election of optional retirement benefit.
A participant may elect, or may revoke said election, at any time prior to his actual retirement date, to have his retirement benefit payable under the options hereinafter set forth, in lieu of the single life benefit he is otherwise entitled to receive. The benefit shall be paid in accordance with the terms of said option. Election of said option shall be made by the participant in writing. The amount of the optional retirement benefit shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of benefit that would otherwise be payable to the participant under article V.
Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit ("MDIB") requirement of proposed Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-2, or its successor. This rule ensures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental. If a participant designates a beneficiary or elects a form of benefit that would cause the payments to violate the MDIB rules, the pension board may, at its discretion, require the participant to designate another beneficiary or adjust the form of payment to satisfy such rules.
(Ord. No. 6340, 12/12/2001, § 12)
Section 3. Social Security option.
A participant who retires from active service with a normal, early, or unreduced early retirement benefit as specified in Article V, Sections 1, 3, or 5, may elect this option and receive an increased retirement benefit payable to the participant during his lifetime until he is eligible for benefits commenced under O.A.S.D.I. and a decreased retirement benefit payable thereafter for life in order to have a more level retirement income when such decreased retirement benefit is added to his primary benefits under O.A.S.D.I. determined as of his retirement date; said benefit shall be computed in accordance with the factors set forth below. Upon the death of the participant, all payments will cease and no further benefits shall be payable.
The factors set forth below shall be applied to the assumed O.A.S.D.I. benefit payable at the appropriate age. This amount shall then be added to the monthly retirement benefit determined in accordance with Article V of this plan. At the appropriate age, the same amount is then subtracted from the monthly retirement benefit. If, at the time of retirement, a calculation of the later monthly retirement benefit results in a negative balance, this option may not be elected.

Section 4. Joint and survivor benefit.
A participant may elect to receive an actuarially reduced monthly retirement benefit with a continuation upon his death after retirement of 50%, 75% or 100% of his benefit, to that person he might name as his beneficiary, with the continuation of benefits being for the life of the beneficiary.
The participant's monthly amount shall be a percentage of the full monthly amount otherwise payable as a single life benefit (after adjustment, of any, for early retirement) as follows:
1.
50% joint and survivor option:
a.
If the participant's pension is a nondisability retirement—The percentage shall be 88.0% plus 0.4% for each full year that the beneficiary is older than the participant or 88.0% minus 0.4% for each full year that the beneficiary is younger than the participant;
b.
If the participant's pension is a disability pension—The percentage shall be 77.5% plus 0.4% for each full year that the beneficiary is older than the participant or 77.5% minus 0.4% for each full year that the beneficiary is younger than the participant;
c.
In no event is the percentage to be greater than 99%; and
2.
75% joint and survivor option:
a.
If the participant's pension is a nondisability retirement—The percentage shall be 83.5% plus 0.5% for each full year that the beneficiary is older than the participant or 83.5% minus 0.5% for each full year that the beneficiary is younger than the participant;
b.
If the participant's pension is a disability pension—The percentage shall be 70.0% plus 0.5% for each full year that the beneficiary is older than the participant or 70.0% minus 0.5% for each full year that the beneficiary is younger than the participant;
c.
In no event is the percentage to be greater than 99%; and
3.
100% joint and survivor option:
a.
If the participant's pension is a nondisability retirement—The percentage shall be 79.0% plus 0.6% for each full year that the beneficiary is older than the participant or 79.0% minus 0.6% for each full year that the beneficiary is younger than the participant;
b.
If the participant's pension is a disability pension—The percentage shall be 63.0% plus 0.6% for each full year that the beneficiary is older than the participant or 63.0% minus 0.6% for each full year that the beneficiary is younger than the participant;
c.
In no event is the percentage to be greater than 99%.
Section 5. Joint and survivor level benefit option.
A participant may elect to receive the Social Security option (section 3 of this article) and a joint and survivor option (50%, 75% or 100%), (section 4 of this article), so that the participant will receive the increased retirement benefit until he is eligible for benefits to commence under O.A.S.D.I. and the decreased benefit payable thereafter for the remainder of his lifetime. Upon his death, the beneficiary will receive a percentage of the benefit the participant was receiving at the time of his death (50%, 75% or 100%, whichever the participant had elected). However, in the event the participant dies before benefits commence under O.A.S.D.I., the beneficiary will receive a percentage (as elected) of the benefit the participant was receiving at the time of his death until the date he would have been entitled to O.A.S.D.I. benefits, at which time the beneficiary will receive a percentage (as elected) of the benefit the participant would have received.
This option may not be elected if the benefits payable under this plan after the participant commences to receive O.A.S.D.I. benefits, equal an amount less than zero.
The participant's monthly benefit shall be determined as follows:
1.
Determine the benefits payable in accordance with section 3 of this article.
2.
Determine the base level, which is the benefit payable under this plan after the participant commences to receive O.A.S.D.I. benefits. Determine the supplemental level, which is the benefit payable under this plan prior to the participant's commencement of O.A.S.D.I. benefits, minus the base level.
3.
Multiply the joint and survivor option factors (in accordance with section 4 of this article) times the base level.
4.
Multiply the supplemental level times the applicable factor below:
a.
50% joint and survivor option: 1—(.0025 × the years the supplemental level amount will be paid)
b.
75% joint and survivor option: 1—(.0035 × the years the supplemental level amount will be paid)
c.
100% joint and survivor option: 1—(.0045 × the years the supplemental level amount will be paid)
5.
Add the amounts determined in subsections (3) and (4) of this section; this is the benefit payable to the participant at retirement.
6.
The amount determined in subsection (3) of this section is the benefit payable to the participant when he commences to receive O.A.S.D.I. benefits, and shall be payable for the remainder of his lifetime.
7.
Upon the participant's death, the beneficiary will receive a monthly benefit equal to a percentage (as elected) of the benefit the participant was receiving. If the participant dies prior to the date O.A.S.D.I. benefits commence, the beneficiary will receive a percentage (as elected) of the benefits the participant was receiving until the date the participant's O.A.S.D.I. benefits would have commenced, at which time the beneficiary will receive a percentage (as elected) of the benefit the participant would have received.

Section 7. Joint and Survivor Benefit with Pop-up Feature.
Effective on or after May 13, 2004, a participant may elect to receive an actuarially reduced monthly retirement benefit with a continuation upon his death after retirement of 50%, 75% or 100% of his benefit, to that person he might name as his beneficiary, with the continuation of benefits being for the life of the beneficiary. In the event the beneficiary predeceases the participant, after benefits have commenced, the participant's monthly benefit shall be adjusted to the single life benefit. This "pop-up" adjustment shall be made the month following written notification to the plan of the beneficiary's death. Notification shall also include a certified copy of the death certificate of the beneficiary. This option is available to participants until the day before the beginning date of any plan year in which the provision of this option would result in an increase in the City/BLW's contribution to the pension plans. In which case, authorization for this option will cease and it will no longer be available to participants.
If this option is elected, the participant's monthly retirement benefit amount shall be a percentage of the full monthly amount otherwise payable as a single life benefits (after adjustment, if any), for early retirement as follows:
1.
50% joint and survivor option:
a.
If the participant's pension is a nondisability retirement the percentage shall be 87.5%, plus 0.4% for each full year the beneficiary is older than the participant, or 87.5% minus 0.4% for each full year the beneficiary is younger than the participant.
b.
If the participant's pension is a disability retirement the percentage shall be 77.0% plus 0.4% for each full year the beneficiary is older than the participant, or 77.0% minus 0.4% for each full year the beneficiary is younger than the participant.
c.
In no event is the percentage to be greater than 99%; and
2.
75% joint and survivor option:
a.
If the participant's pension is a nondisability retirement the percentage shall be 82.9%, plus 0.5% for each full year the beneficiary is older than the participant, or 82.9% minus 0.5% for each full year the beneficiary is younger than the participant.
b.
If the participant's pension is a disability retirement the percentage shall be 69.4% plus 0.5% for each full year the beneficiary is older than the participant, or 69.4% minus 0.5% for each full year the beneficiary is younger than the participant.
c.
In no event is the percentage to be greater than 99%; and
3.
100% joint and survivor option:
a.
If the participant's pension is a nondisability retirement the percentage shall be 78.3%, plus 0.6% for each full year the beneficiary is older than the participant, or 78.3% minus 0.6% for each full year the beneficiary is younger than the participant.
b.
If the participant's pension is a disability retirement the percentage shall be 62.3% plus 0.6% for each full year the beneficiary is older than the participant, or 62.3% minus 0.6% for each full year the beneficiary is younger than the participant.
c.
In no event is the percentage to be greater than 99%.
4.
Modification of benefit reduction factors: Periodically the above factors will be reviewed and may be modified as necessary to ensure that the option provided under this section 7 does not increase the City/BLW's required contributions necessary to fund the plan.

ARTICLE VIII
Maximum Benefits [6]
Section 8.01 General rule.
The annual benefit payable under this plan to a participant at any time shall not exceed the maximum permissible amount under Code Section 415(b) and the regulations thereunder as applicable to governmental plans (as defined in Code Section 414(d)) and which are hereby incorporated by reference. "Maximum permissible amount" shall mean $160,000.00, as adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for each calendar year, with the new limitation to apply to limitation years ending within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment (the "dollar limitation").
The limitation above is sometimes referred to herein as the "Code Section 415(b) limitation.
Section 8.02 Reduction for less than ten years of participation or employment.
If the annual benefit commences when the participant has less than ten years of participation in this plan or any predecessor plan to this plan, the dollar limitation shall be reduced by one-tenth for each year less than ten, but in no event shall be less than one-tenth of the unreduced dollar limitation.
Section 8.03 Adjustment if the annual benefit commences before age 62 or after age 65.
If the payment of benefits under this plan commences before age 62 or after age 65, the dollar limitation shall be adjusted as provided in this Section 10.03. The method for making this adjustment is not affected by whether the benefit is payable in a form subject to Code Section 417(e)(3).
Generally, the age-adjusted dollar limitation is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation payable at age 65, as calculated under (a) or (b) below, whichever is applicable:
(a)
If the Age at Which the Benefit is Payable is Less Than 62: The dollar limitation is determined by reducing the dollar limitation at age 65 on an actuarially equivalent basis. First, reduce the dollar limitation at age 65 using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factors, as applicable, which are set forth in the plan for the reduction of benefits for early commencement. Second, reduce the dollar limitation at age 65 using five percent interest and the applicable mortality table. Use the lesser of the amounts determined under the two preceding sentences as the age-adjusted dollar limitation under this paragraph (a).
If the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007, the defined benefit dollar limitation for the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than ten, if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (1) the interest rate specified in the plan and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the plan; or (2) a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as defined in the plan.
(i)
Plan Does Not Have Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at Both Age 62 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limitation for the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than ten, if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for the annuity starting date as defined in the plan (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date).
(ii)
Plan has Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at Both Age 62 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the plan has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the dollar limitation for the participant's annuity starting date is the lesser of the limitation determined under subsection (i), and the dollar limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than ten, if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the participant's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this section.
(b)
If the Age at Which the Benefit is Payable is Later Than 65: The dollar limitation is determined by increasing the dollar limitation at age 65 on an actuarially equivalent basis. The increased age-adjusted dollar limitation shall be the lesser of the equivalent amount computed using the interest rate and mortality table set forth in article 1 in the definition of actuarial equivalence under the plan and the equivalent amount computed using five percent interest and the applicable mortality table.
If the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007, the dollar limitation for the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than ten, if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (1) the interest rate specified in the plan and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified the plan; or (2) a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as defined in the plan.
(i)
Plan Does Not Have Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at Both Age 65 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the dollar limitation at the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than ten, if required), with actuarial equivalence computed using a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for that annuity starting date as defined [in] the plan (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). "(d) For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the actuarial adjustment is equal to the equivalent annual benefit, computed using (i) the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the plan; (ii) a 5.5 percent interest assumption and the applicable mortality table for distributions under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2); or (iii) the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) and the applicable mortality table for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) divided by 1.05.
(ii)
Plan Has Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at Both Age 65 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the plan has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the dollar limitation at the participant's annuity starting date is the lesser of the limitation determined under subsection (i) above, and the dollar limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than ten, if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the participant's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the participant, computed disregarding the participant's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical participant who is age 65 and has the same accrued benefit as the participant.
Section 8.04 Special rules.
(a)
All Plans a Single Plan. For purposes of the maximum limitations of this article, all defined benefit plans maintained by the employer shall be considered as a single defined benefit plan, and all defined contribution plans maintained by the employer shall be considered a single defined contribution plan.
(b)
Special Limitation for Qualified Police or Firefighter. If a participant is a "qualified participant" as defined under Code Section 415(b)(2)(G), such Participant may retire before age 62, without a reduction in the dollar limitation if at least 15 years of service is required to receive a full benefit under the plan.
(c)
Ancillary Benefits. "Ancillary benefits" i.e., benefits that are not directly related to retirement income benefits, or as otherwise defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(B), shall not count toward the dollar limitation. Such ancillary benefits include pre-retirement disability benefits and death benefits.
Section 8.05 Definitions.
For purposes of this Article 10, the following definitions shall apply:
(a)
"Annual additions" means the sum of the following amounts credited to a participant's account under a defined contribution plan for the limitation year:
(i)
Employer contributions;
(ii)

(iv)
Amounts described in Code Sections 415(l)(1) and 419A(d)(2).
(b)
"Annual benefit" means a retirement benefit under the plan which is payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity.

No actuarial adjustment to the non-annuity benefit form is required for (i) the value of a qualified joint and survivor annuity; (ii) the value of benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a disability benefit, pre-retirement death benefits, and post-retirement medical benefits); or (iii) the value of post-retirement cost-of-living increases made in accordance with Treasury Regulations.
(i)
Conversion for optional forms subject to Code Section 417(c)(3). For purposes of applying the maximum permissible amount, retirement benefits payable in an optional form other than a straight life annuity, which are subject to Code Section 417(c)(3) are adjusted to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that is equal to the greater of the equivalent annual benefit, computed using the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the plan and the equivalent annual benefit computed using the applicable mortality table under Rev. Rul. 2001-62.
(ii)
Conversion for optional forms not subject to Code Section 417(c)(3).

For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the actuarial adjustment is equal to the equivalent annual benefit, computed using (i) the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the plan; (ii) a 5.5-percent interest assumption and the applicable mortality table for distributions under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2); or (iii) the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) and the applicable mortality table for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) divided by 1.05.
(B)
For limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007, the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the participant's form of benefit computed using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount: (I) the interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified in the plan for adjusting benefits in the same form and (II) a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table described in Code Section 417(e)(3).

In addition, compensation shall be increased by the amount by which the participant's compensation is reduced by salary reduction or similar arrangement under Section 132(f)(4) of the Code (i.e., a qualified transportation fringe benefit program).
The annual compensation taken into account shall not exceed the limitations of Code Section 401(a)(17) in effect as of the beginning of the plan year in which it is paid.

Section 1. Benefits payments generally.
A.
A participant who is eligible to receive benefits under this plan and makes application in accordance with the rules of this retirement plan shall be entitled upon retirement to receive the monthly benefits provided for the remainder of his life, subject to the provisions of this plan. Benefit payments shall be payable commencing with the first full calendar month in which the participant has fulfilled all the conditions for entitlement to benefits.

C.
Pension payment shall end with the payment for the month in which the death of the pensioner occurs, except as provided in accordance with a joint and survivor benefit.
D.
Pension benefits shall be payable commencing with the month following the month in which the claimant has fulfilled all the conditions for entitlement to benefits, including the requirement of Section 2 of the filing of an application and notice of retirement with the pension board. The first day of such first month is what is meant by the "effective date" of the pension.
An employee may elect, in writing filed with the pension board, to receive benefits first payable for a later month, provided that no such election may postpone the commencement of benefits to a date later than April 1 following the calendar year in which the employee will reach age 70½, or, if later, retires.
E.
In order to properly calculate all duty performed, the issuance of the first pension check will occur no later than the fifteenth day of the month in which benefits are payable. Subsequent pension checks will be issued on or before the first day of the month in which benefits are payable.

Section 2. Filing an application for benefits.
A participant must file an application for benefits under the plan no earlier than 90 days and no later than 30 days in advance of the date benefit payments are to commence. Nevertheless, the pension board has discretion to consider an application submitted less than 30 days in advance in the event of the participant's terminal medical condition, a department head's need to fill a position occupied by the applicant, or other exigent circumstances. Such application may be in any form adequate to give reasonable notice to the pension board and shall set forth the basis of such application and shall authorize the pension board to conduct such examinations as may be necessary to facilitate the payment of any benefits to which the participant or beneficiary may be entitled under the plan.
(Ord. No. 8273 , 4/13/2022, § 2)
Section 3. Claims.

Section 4. Forfeiture for certain crimes.
A.

G.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 4 to the contrary and to the extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to employees hired or rehired after July 1, 1985, who committed a public employment related crime before July 1, 2008, the city reserves the right to require forfeiture of all rights and benefits under the plan in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 47-1-22(b) in effect prior to July 1, 2008.

Amendment and Termination
Section 1. Amendment of the plan.
The governing authority shall have the right at any time, and from time to time, to amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the plan following the review and recommendation by the pension board; provided, however, that no such amendment shall:
A.
Reduce the accrued benefits of any employee participant or employee beneficiary as defined in Article III, Section 1, however, expressly an amendment may reduce or add benefits to elected or appointed members and applicable beneficiaries of the governing body from time to time as provisions under the city pension plan vary between employee and elected officials with the effective date being January 8, 2014, or
B.
Authorize or permit any part of the trust fund held by the provider to be diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of participants and their beneficiaries, and
C.
No amendment shall operate to derive any participant or beneficiary of any rights or benefits irrevocably vested in him under the plan prior to such amendment except that the governing authority may make any and all changes and modifications necessary to qualify the plan or to keep the plan qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder, or any amendment thereto.
Section 2. Termination of the plan.
A.
The employer expects the plan to be continued indefinitely but, of necessity, reserves the right to terminate the plan and contributions thereunder at any time by action of the governing authority. Upon receipt of written notice from the governing authority of termination of the plan, the board shall prepare a list of all participants showing for each, as of the date of plan termination, the following:
1.
For each retired participant and beneficiary receiving payment of benefits, the amount and terms of payment of such benefits.
2.
For each terminated participant entitled to a deferred benefit, the amount, commencement date, and terms of payment of such benefit.
3.
For each active participant the amount of his accrued benefit.
B.
The board shall arrange for the liquidation of all assets held in the plan maintained in connection with the plan and shall prepare a statement of the liquidated value of such assets. The governing authority, in its sole discretion, may direct the board to purchase from an insurance company an annuity contract or contracts which provide the benefits to which each participant or beneficiary is entitled or to pay a lump sum to each participant or beneficiary, such lump sum amount to be [the] actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which such participant or beneficiary is entitled.
C.
The board shall then deduct from the assets total remaining expenses incurred or to be incurred by the board on behalf of the plan. The board shall, except as otherwise provided in this section, then allocate the remaining assets for distribution in accordance with the classes listed below. The benefits of each class shall be satisfied before proceeding to the next class. If at any time the remaining plan assets would be insufficient to provide the accrued benefits for the class in question, the remaining assets would be applied on a pro rata basis within that class, and all subsequent classes would receive no benefit.
Class 1—Retired participants or beneficiaries who are receiving payments on the termination date.
Class 2—Participants delaying retirement.
Class 3—Participants eligible for early retirement.
Class 4—Former employees who are terminated participants.
Class 5—All other participants on a pro rata basis.
D.
Upon distribution of the assets as specified above, the plan shall be regarded as terminated and no participant or beneficiary shall have any further rights or claim therein.

A.
The plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia.

In the event that any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this agreement shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the previously existing provisions or the other section or section, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase so declared or adjudicated invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The governing authority hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this agreement or retained the previously existing provisions if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudicated invalid or unconstitutional.
Section 2. Non-alienation of benefits.
None of the benefits, payments, proceeds, or distributions payable under the plan shall be subject to the claim of any creditor of any participant or to the claim of any creditor of any beneficiary hereunder, or to any legal process of levy or attachment by a creditor of any such participant or beneficiary; and no such benefits shall be in any manner liable for or subject to the debts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of any participant or beneficiary; and neither any such participant or beneficiary shall have any right to alienate, commute, anticipate, transfer, encumber, pledge or assign any of the benefits, payments, proceeds, or distributions under the plan. If any participant or beneficiary shall become bankrupt or attempt to anticipate, assign, or pledge any benefits, then such benefits shall, in the discretion of the pension board, cease, and in that event the pension board shall have authority to cause the same, or any part thereof, to be held or applied to or for the benefit of such member, his spouse, his children, or other dependents, or any of them, in such manner and in such proportion as the pension board may think proper.
Section 3. Legally incompetent.
Any participant or beneficiary receiving or claiming benefits under the plan shall be conclusively presumed to be mentally competent and of age until the pension board receives a written notice, in a form and manner acceptable to it, that such person is incompetent or a minor, and that a guardian or other person legally vested with the care of his estate has been appointed. In the event that the pension board finds that any person to whom a benefit is payable under the plan is unable to properly care for his affairs, or is a minor, then any payment due (unless a prior claim therefor shall have been made by a duly appointed legal representative) may be paid to the spouse, a child; a parent, or a brother or sister, or to any person deemed by the pension board to have incurred expense for such person otherwise entitled to payment. In the event a guardian of the estate of any person receiving or claiming benefits under the plan shall be appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, payments shall be made to such guardian provided that proper proof of appointment is furnished in a form and manner suitable to the pension board. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of liability therefor under the plan.
Section 4. Benefits supported only by trust fund.
Any person having any claim under the plan will look solely to the assets of the trust fund for satisfaction. In no event will the employer, or any of its employees or agents, be liable in their individual capacities to any person whosoever, under the provisions of the plan.
Section 5. Discrimination.
The employer through the pension board, shall administer the plan in a uniform and consistent manner with respect to all participants and shall not permit discrimination in favor of supervisory or highly paid employees, elected or appointed members of the governing authority, the chief legal officer or any associate legal officer of the city, or any municipal officer elected or appointed to preside over the court of said city.
Section 6. Limitation of liability; legal actions.
A.
It is expressly understood and agreed by each employee who becomes a participant hereunder that, except for its or their willful neglect or fraud, neither the employer, nor the pension board, shall be in any way subject to any suit or litigation, or to any legal liability, for any cause or reason or thing whatsoever, in connection with the plan or its operation, and each such participant hereby releases the employer, all its employees and agents, and the pension board, from any and all liability or obligation.
B.
To any action or proceeding involving any rights under the plan or the proper administration thereof, the city and the pension board shall be the only necessary parties and no participant, or his beneficiary, or any other persons having or claiming to have an interest in the plan shall be entitled to any notice or process. Any final judgment which is not appealed or appealable that may be entered in any such action or proceeding shall be binding and conclusive on the parties hereto and all persons having or claiming to have an interest.
Section 7. Service in the Armed Forces.
Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 414(u).
