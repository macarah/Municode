4-4-34-060 - Authorization for travel/training.
A.
As soon as the requesting party becomes aware of the need to travel, he should prepare and submit a request for travel and training form to his authorizing party. All estimated expenses and a description of each expense should be filled out on one form. For example, registration, lodging, airfare, mileage and all other costs should not be submitted on multiple request forms. The form should be submitted to the authorizing party in sufficient time for the authorizing party to adequately assess it and forward the request to the finance department, budget officer and, if necessary, the city manager or his designee.
B.
The authorizing party is responsible for determining that:
1.
There is factual and sufficient justification provided by the requesting party to permit approval and that the request only includes expenditures for expenses authorized under this policy.
2.
There is sufficient unexpended appropriation amount remaining in the department's travel budget to reimburse all anticipated costs of travel. Inquiries regarding the remaining budget balance available can be done through the information available to the department head via online access to the GMBA information on the computer. This will provide the most current information except for trips for which there is no expense report received.
3.
The authorizing party may approve the request form once he has determined the need and validity of the request.
C.
When approved by the department head, the original of the request for travel and training form shall be sent to the finance department (to be matched with the subsequently submitted expense report form covering the actual accounting of the trip costs). After review the request form shall be forwarded to the budget officer for verification of funds available, and, if necessary, to the city manager or his designee. The form will then be forwarded to the finance department to issue checks.
D.
Reservations. Nonrefundable reservations shall not be made until the authorizing party approves the travel and training request form.
E.
Travel Advances. No travel advance for amounts greater than $500.00 will be issued without the prior approval of the city manager.
F.
Estimated Travel Expenses. Travel and training forms for all trips with estimated expenses in the amount of $1,000.00 or more shall be approved by the city manager or his designee regardless if advance checks are issued.
G.
Emergency Travel. Emergency travel situations should follow the above procedures with the exception that it may be necessary, due to time constraints, for the finance department to prepare a manual check. Requests for manual checks should be limited to emergencies. A manual check request should be in writing explaining the emergency need for the check and should be submitted with the travel and training request form no later than 11:00 a.m. on the date needed to allow time for preparation. Manual checks will be ready for pickup by 3:00 p.m. The finance director or his designee will determine if the manual check request is of sufficient urgency to warrant issuing a manual check.
(Code 1978, § 4-1236; Ord. No. 4981, 11/13/91, § 1; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 24)
4-4-34-070 - Expense reimbursement.
The following reimbursement guidelines are intended to set forth maximum standards. Employees of the city/BLW are expected to spend funds prudently. All travel and training expenses should be submitted for reimbursement on the approved travel and training expense form.
A.
Subsistence.
1.
Lodging. Reimbursement for lodging is authorized when the individual's travel requires overnight accommodation. Overnight accommodations are generally not considered necessary within the metro-Atlanta area, however, overnight accommodations will be considered for approval on a case-by-case basis by the city manager or his designee. Detailed receipts (not charge slips) are required for all lodging costs. Charges for meals and telephone calls that are included in hotel/motel bill should be extrapolated for reporting purposes. If a per diem is used, charges for individual meals are not authorized.
a.
Lodging shall be a standard hotel/motel consistent with other facilities available in the area.
b.
Accommodations shall be reimbursed at actual costs incurred at the single room rate.
c.
When two employees share a room, one employee shall pay and request reimbursement for the full lodging charge. The second employee shall not be entitled to any reimbursement since they did not incur any expense.
d.
The requesting party is responsible for obtaining a tax exempt statement from the finance department prior to departure and give the statement to the registrar at their hotel/motel upon arrival. It is recognized that different hotel/motels acknowledge such statements to varying degrees.
2.
Meals.
a.
Meals During Overnight Travel. Employees are entitled to reimbursement for meals based on a per diem amount for overnight travel only. The per diem rate is $40.00 per day and may be amended periodically by the city council. The per diem should be sufficient in most locales visited by the requesting party. Receipts are not required when requesting reimbursement at per diem rates. Occasionally, due to the location of the travel, the per diem rate may be insufficient. Reimbursement in excess of the per diem rate will be considered only when supported by receipts clearly proving more cost was incurred. This is intended to reimburse the traveler for higher costs in major cities and not provide a reason to spend more. The department heads are expected to carefully monitor and specifically approve/deny requests for reimbursement in excess of the per diem rate.
Breakfast allowance will not be authorized, either in a per diem calculation or based on receipt, if the business travel was initiated from the employee's home as the first business activity of the day. If the requesting party returns to their home or to Cobb County before 2:00 p.m., then the $10.00 allotment for lunch for that day's travel per diem will be deducted. If the requesting party returns to their home or to Cobb County before 7:00 p.m., then the $15.00 allotment for dinner of that day's travel per diem will be deducted.
b.
If meals are provided as a part of the registration, such meals should be deducted from the per diem authorized by the following amounts of the per diem: $7.00 for breakfast, $10.00 for lunch and $15.00 for dinner. Example: At a per diem rate of $40.00 per day with a luncheon that is provided as a part of the registration, the reduced per diem for that day of the conference would be $40 - $10 = $30.
c.
Single Day Travel. Reimbursement may be made for meal expense during single day travel based on the individual meal allotment amounts described in the above paragraph if the following requisite conditions exist:
Breakfast—Generally, no reimbursement will be authorized for breakfast during a single day trip unless the employee is attending a formal breakfast at which the city/BLW business is conducted or a breakfast that is included as a part of a registration fee for a workshop, seminar, etc.
Lunch—Generally, no reimbursement will be authorized for lunch during a single day trip except under the following conditions:
(1)
The employee cannot return from city/BLW business before 2:00 p.m.; or
(2)
The employee is attending a formal luncheon at which city/BLW business is conducted.
(3)
The luncheon is included as a part of a registration fee for a workshop, seminar, etc.
Dinner—Reimbursement may be authorized provided the employee returns to their home or to Cobb County after 7:00 p.m.
B.
Transportation Expense. Transportation shall be reimbursed at the most economical rate for the most economical and practical method of travel. Example: The traveler may choose to travel by personal vehicle, perhaps so that his family may go along; however, the most economical method is to fly at coach rates with the ticket for the employee purchased through the city-designated travel agency. Therefore, the traveler would be reimbursed for the amount of such coach ticket.
1.
Ticketed Travel. A travel agency in the metropolitan Atlanta area shall be selected by the purchasing division with the approval of the city manager to be the city/BLW's sole agent for providing travel reservations and ticketing for a predetermined time period. All requesting parties who anticipate overnight travel or air travel should check with this travel agency as to the most economical method of travel. Employees have the option of arranging air travel through this agency in which case the invoices will be paid directly to the agency by the finance department. Employees also have the option of booking air travel via the Internet and charging the fare to their personal credit card. Reimbursement to the employee will be made using the travel and training expense form. The authorizing party should certify that the method of travel selected is the most economical and practical method for the city/BLW.
Reimbursement for ticketed travel expense should be substantiated by the traveler's copy of the ticket or travel agency invoices as well as copies of any automobile rental contracts.
2.
City Vehicles. The use of a city/BLW vehicle is authorized for travel to a destination of up to 400 miles from Cobb County. Operation of the city/BLW vehicle outside the State of Georgia requires the prior approval of the department head.
If more than one employee is attending the same conference or business meeting, only one city/BLW vehicle shall be used until the limit of the capacity of such vehicle is attained.
Gasoline and oil should not, except in emergency situations, be purchased for city/BLW vehicles at commercial providers in the metropolitan Atlanta area. The traveler in the metropolitan area should prepare the city/BLW vehicle for anticipated travel at the motor transport division or other designated city/BLW loading areas.
Receipts must be obtained for all city/BLW vehicle expenses incurred, including gasoline purchases, for reimbursement approval.
City/BLW vehicles may be driven only by city/BLW employees and officials.
3.
Personal Vehicles.
a.
Advance approval for use of a personal vehicle for business travel must be obtained from the department head. Advance approval for department and division heads for personal vehicle usage is not necessary, but the criteria below will be applied for approval for reimbursement purposes.

b.
Mileage expense authorized shall be calculated from the initiating point of the business travel (either from the employee's home or the work site).

The mileage reimbursement rate is $0.40 per mile [effective July 1, 2007] and may be increased or decreased by council action. Requested mileage reimbursement must be supported by odometer readings (as amended by Ord. No. 5300, 5/11/94).
c.
Employees who are directed to utilize their personal vehicles for the conduct of city/BLW business, should be reimbursed for all business miles driven during such trips. Employees who are routinely assigned to conduct city/BLW business through the use of their personal vehicles should complete a monthly mileage log which should indicate the time and date the trip was initiated and completed, purpose of the trip and odometer readings at the beginning and end of the trip.
Reimbursement for the business use of a personal vehicle constitutes all compensation for the use of the vehicle including insurance for property damage to the vehicle, breakdown repairs, etc.

If receipts cannot be obtained, the employee shall certify as to the accuracy of the amount paid on the expense report upon return.
C.
Registration. Registration fees are paid by the finance department in advance of the trip provided the travel request with sufficient documentation is received two weeks in advance of the date that a check is needed. The requesting party should make every attempt to take advantage of discounted registration fees by meeting early-bird registration deadlines. If advance registration is not utilized, registration fees for approved conferences or seminars are reimbursable when supported by receipts. An expense report for registration fees is necessary even if the employee did not receive any additional funds for the training.

Failure to provide the required receipts will result in the unsupported amount not being reimbursed. The authorizing party shall review, sign and submit the expense report to the finance department within two workdays after receipt from the requesting party. The employee signature on the expense reports will be certification by the employee that all expenses paid are compliant with this policy.
2.
Settlement of Travel Advances. If the requesting party received a travel advance that was greater than the actual expenses incurred, a check in the amount of the unused portion of the advance must accompany the expense report. Any travel advance that remains outstanding for periods greater than 15 calendar days from the date of return, shall be deemed a salary advance and may be deducted from the employee's next paycheck. Further advances will not be issued until the employee has settled all previous travel advances.
3.
Finance Department Review. The finance department shall audit all expense reports to determine mathematical accuracy; cross reference amount claimed to appropriate receipts; and review the appropriateness of expenditures in accordance with this policy. Upon determination of accuracy and compliance, the finance department will authorize the issuance of a check of net amounts due to the employee in the event that actual expenses exceed any advance taken. Reimbursement as a result of an expense report will be processed only after the report has been matched with the travel request form. If a reimbursement is due to the requesting party, the budget officer will approve the expense form verifying that funds are available for such reimbursement.
