8-4-060 - Option to establish exemption or reduction in occupation tax.
A.
The mayor and city council may by subsequent ordinance or resolution provide for an exemption or reduction in occupation tax to one or more types of businesses or practitioners of occupations or professions as part of a plan for economic development or attracting or encouraging selected types of business or practitioners of selected occupations or professions. Such exemptions or reductions in occupation tax shall not be arbitrary or capricious and the reasons shall be set forth in the minutes of the public hearing of mayor and city council.
B.
The City of Marietta wishes to encourage companies to locate their businesses within the corporate limits of Marietta and at the same time, Marietta is equally concerned with retaining those businesses who have chosen Marietta as its home base of operation. In order to meet these varying economic development goals, it is the City of Marietta's position that it wishes to establish a regressive rate of taxation for businesses with gross receipts of $5,000,000.00 and over. By imposing these regressive tax rates, it is the goal of the City of Marietta to encourage businesses to locate in Marietta and grow in sales or service dollar volume with the ultimate award being a reduction in the tax rate on the business' gross receipts reach $5,000,000.00. It is anticipated that the businesses of Marietta affected by this limitation will create more jobs and commerce within the jurisdiction of the City of Marietta.
