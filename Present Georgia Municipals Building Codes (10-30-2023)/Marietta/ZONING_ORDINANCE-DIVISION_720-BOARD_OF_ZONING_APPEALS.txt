720.03 - Powers and duties.
A.
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the powers to:
1.
Hear and decide special land use permit requests as delineated in this article.
2.
Hear and decide appeals from the decision of the Planning and Zoning Director where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination.
3.
Grant variances from zoning regulations of this article in cases where strict application of such regulations would result in unnecessary hardship; but only in harmony with the spirit and intent of these regulations and is the minimum necessary to grant relief without injury to the public interest. All such variances must be based upon the evidence submitted before the Board of Zoning Appeals and upon its findings, supported by the testimony or by documentary testimony that such variance shall be required by 1 of the following causes:
a)
Because of the existence in good faith of a nonconforming use at a time prior to the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Marietta, or amendments thereto, requires the continuance of such nonconforming use,
b)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions creating a substantial hardship to the applicant which pertain to the particular piece of property or building in question because of its size, shape or topography.
B.
Every such judgment of the Board of Zoning Appeals granting a variance, appeal or Special Land Use Permit shall be accompanied by a finding of fact specifying the reasons thereof.
C.
In granting any variance under the provisions of this section, the Board of Zoning Appeals may designate such conditions in connection therewith as will, in its opinion, secure substantially the objectives of these regulations and may designate conditions to be performed or met by the user or property owner, out of regard for the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare of the community, including safeguards for, with respect to light, air, areas of occupancy, density of population and conformity to any master or through traffic plan, the future development of the City.
D.
Approved variances must be implemented within a period of 12 months. After 12 months, board approval must be obtained again. A building permit must be obtained and the development underway within the 12-month time period.
E.
The Board may in conformity with this article reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and to that end shall have all the duty of the Planning and Zoning Director to carry out the decisions of the Board.
F.
Variances may not be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals conditioned upon the approval by City Council of an application to amend this article or to amend the Official Zoning Map.
G.
Variances granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals or City Council shall only remain in effect as long as the property to which it applies remains in the same zoning classification such property was in at the time the variance was granted.
H.
No variances may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals that would allow any part of a structure to be constructed over a sanitary sewer line, water line or stormwater line; or over any required easement for such lines.
(Ord. No. 7964, 6/14/2017, § 1)
720.04 - Procedures.
A.
An appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person, firm, or corporation aggrieved or by any governmental officer, department, board or agency affected by any decision of the Planning and Zoning Director with respect to this article. Such appeal shall be made within 10 days following notification of the decision appealed from, by filing with the Planning and Zoning Director a notice of appeal and specifying the grounds thereof. The Planning and Zoning Director shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action was taken.
B.
A copy of the paid in full tax bill or a letter from the City of Marietta Tax Department stating that all taxes have been paid must accompany the application for a variance before it will be processed.
C.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying any variances granted.
D.
Time limit on resubmission. An application for a variance affecting the same property shall not be submitted more than once every 12 months; however, an applicant may petition the Board of Zoning Appeal to waive the 12 month waiting period by demonstrating that the situations or amount of variance requested which led to denial have materially changed or if the request is materially different.
