(Ord. No. 8227 , 7/14/2021, § 1)
4-4-24-010 - Purpose.
A.
It is the policy of the city/BLW to establish and maintain a fair and equitable pay and classification system for all employees covered by these personnel rules and regulations. The pay and classification plan is designed to attempt to reflect:
1.
Relative difficulty and responsibility between jobs.
2.
Ranges of pay for other classifications within the city/BLW and competitive rates of pay for similar types of work in public and private employment in the labor market where the city/BLW recruits for employees.
3.
Economic conditions of the job market area, including the availability of qualified candidates.
4.
The city/BLW's economic circumstances.
5.
Financial policies of the city/BLW.
6.
Cost of living factors.
7.
Other business, economic, and operational considerations.
The pay and classification plan is the official and approved system of grouping positions into appropriate pay grades and provides guidelines for administration.
B.
The pay and classification plan is a core component of the city/BLW's personnel policies and practices and should be used as follows:
1.
A guide in recruiting and evaluating candidates for employment.
2.
To determine lines of promotions and developing employee training programs.
3.
To determine the salary range for each position.
4.
To provide uniform pay information which is understood by city officials, employees, and the general public.
5.
To assist in maintaining and revising organizational structure, clarifying lines of authority and affixing responsibility.
(Ord. No. 8227 , 7/14/2021, § 1)
4-4-24-020 - Content.
A "position" is a set of assigned tasks, duties, and responsibilities requiring full-or part-time employment of one person. A position may be occupied or vacant. Each position will be assigned a classification and an appropriate pay range. Classifications and pay ranges shall be listed in the city/BLW's pay and classification plan.
Position descriptions are descriptive statements about every position in the organization. The position description contains a position/classification title, specific duties and responsibilities of that position (including those constituting "essential functions"), training and experience requirements, and other descriptive information defining the position.
A classification title is the official designation or name given to each written position description and shall be used on all official and personnel records.
The pay and classification plan shall establish a salary range for every classification in the city/BLW. Such salary ranges shall be determined with due regard to the factors identified in Section 4-4-24-010(A).
(Ord. No. 8227 , 7/14/2021, § 1)
4-4-24-030 - Plan administration and maintenance.
A.
Responsibility for Administration and Maintenance of the Pay and Classification Plan. The HR director shall be responsible for administering the pay and classification plan and for interpreting (and, in appropriate cases, making recommendations to the city manager regarding) the application of the plan to any compensation concerns not specifically covered by these guidelines.
The HR director shall also review and make recommendations regarding any necessary or appropriate updates or revisions to the pay and classification plan during the annual budget process or, with the approval of the city manager, as needed during the budget year.
The HR director may make or cause to have made such comparative studies as he/she deems necessary or appropriate of one or more of the factors identified in Section 4-4-24-010(A) affecting the level of salary ranges prior to the preparation of the annual budget, as well as at other times as needed. The HR director may request other officials and/or employees to assist in this process. Upon the recommendation of the HR director, the city manager may also authorize a review of the pay and classification plan, or any component thereof, by an independent consultant.
On the basis of the HR director's recommendation and the information derived from any such studies and/or reviews, the city manager shall recommend to the city council such changes in salary ranges or other aspects of the pay and classification plan as he/she deems necessary to fulfill the purpose of this article.
B.
Position Descriptions and Classifications. Each department head shall be responsible for developing and maintaining accurate position descriptions, for updating and revising existing position descriptions as provided herein, and for abolishing position descriptions that are no longer needed. The HR director will assist the department heads as needed in fulfilling their responsibilities under this article.
Should the duties and responsibilities of a position change, the department head must ensure that the official position description is updated and revised accordingly. All such updated/revised position descriptions must be submitted to the HR director for approval, who will also evaluate whether a change in classification is warranted. The HR director's evaluation of the proposed updated/revised position description may result in one of the following actions:
1.
A determination that no change to the position description is necessary.
2.
A determination that the position description should be updated and revised as proposed (subject to any adjustments the HR director deems appropriate), but that the position is properly classified.
3.
A determination that the position description should be updated and revised as proposed (subject to any adjustments the HR director deems appropriate) and that the updates/revisions may warrant reclassification to a currently established higher or lower-level classification as well as a change in the assigned pay grade and/or job title.
4.
A determination that the position warrants reclassification to a new classification that requires the official establishment of a new position description.
Whenever a position description is updated/revised, the HR director should initiate an inquiry into whether similar updates/revisions for the descriptions of positions in closely related classifications are warranted.
Whenever a position description is updated/revised or a position is reclassified, the HR director should determine the effect, if any, on the position's status as exempt or non-exempt under the FLSA.
Whenever a position is reclassified, the HR director should determine whether the reclassification requires the abolition of the classification and the subsequent removal of the position from the pay and classification plan.
C.
Position Review.
1.
Vacancies. Each time a vacancy occurs, the position shall be reviewed by the department head to determine whether the position has changed since the last time the position description was updated/revised. If so, then the department head will prepare and submit to the HR director a proposed updated/revised position description, identifying the altered functions and other changes to the position, to facilitate the evaluation described above, including a recommendation whether reclassification of the position is warranted. If the HR director determines that the proposed updates/revisions do not impact the classification of the position, the position description will be updated/revised prior to posting and advertising of the vacant position. If the HR director determines that the proposed updates/revisions require reclassification of the vacant position, the department head must submit a reclassification request as provided below during the annual budget process or service proposal process, unless the city manager specifically authorizes a reclassification review within the fiscal year.
2.
Non-Vacancies. Department heads must otherwise initiate requests for position reclassification during the annual budget or service proposal process whenever a significant change in the duties of a particular position has occurred. Such requests should be submitted via a memorandum of justification to the HR director, identifying the altered functions and other changes to the position, along with a copy of the proposed updated/revised position description. The HR director will review all reclassification requests and complete necessary job audits to determine the appropriate classification. The HR director may then recommend a suitable course of action to the city manager as provided in Subsection B above.
D.
Position Control. All positions in the city/BLW are established and maintained through a personnel budget each fiscal year in accordance with established budgeting and accounting procedures. The establishment of new or additional positions or upward reclassification of approved positions will require approval by the city council. Downward reclassification and lateral changes of approved positions will require the approval of the city manager.
E.
Change in Exemption Status. Any change in exemption status will require approval of the city manager and city council; provided, however, that the city manager shall have the discretion to implement temporary changes pending council approval if deemed appropriate.
(Ord. No. 8227 , 7/14/2021, § 1)
4-4-24-040 - Employee requests for review of classification.
A.
An employee shall have the right to seek review of his/her position classification, or any changes made thereto. Any such request must be submitted in writing to the employee's immediate supervisor/manager and include a memorandum and position description outlining any relevant changes in duties and responsibilities to the position or explaining any other reasons believed to support the requested reclassification.
B.
The supervisor/manager shall review the request and supporting materials provided by the employee, prepare a memorandum indicating agreement or disagreement with the reclassification request and explaining the basis for such agreement or disagreement, and forward the request, supporting materials, and memorandum to his department head. The department head shall review the information provided by the employee and supervisor/manager, prepare a memorandum indicating agreement or disagreement with the supervisor/manager's determination and explaining the basis for such agreement or disagreement, and forward all documentation to the HR director.
C.
The HR director or his/her designee will meet with the employee, the department head and such other persons as may be necessary to clarify the required duties and responsibilities of the position(s). In his/her discretion, the HR director may conduct or may cause to be conducted a job audit of the position based on observation of tasks performed at the job site(s).
D.
After the information is collected on the position, the HR director or his/her designee shall review the assignment of the job classification and assess the evaluation. The HR director shall make a recommendation to the city manager for final action on the review of classification request.
E.
At each stage, the employee shall be kept advised of the status of the request, which shall be processed as expeditiously as is practicable.
F.
No review of classification request may be resubmitted unless there have been changes in the duties and responsibilities of the position since the previous review was completed.
Under no circumstances will any request for review be accepted at any level on the basis of pay. This is a management decision based on assessment of the employee's actual position, duties, and responsibilities.
G.
The effective date of any action that impacts the employee's pay shall be the date of the final decision. Any additional funding or position upgrade that would result from any reclassification is subject to the approval of the city manager and city council.
(Ord. No. 8227 , 7/14/2021, § 1)
4-4-24-050 - Pay schedules and setting individual employee pay.
A.
Formal pay schedules will be developed and shall include position classification titles, pay grades/ranges, FLSA exemption status, EEOC job category, and position numbers for payroll purposes, and other information as deemed necessary and appropriate by the city manager in consultation with the HR director.
Except as otherwise provided herein, all modifications to established pay schedules must be approved by the city council. Established pay schedules, including any council-approved modified schedules, shall be used by management in setting individual employee pay in accordance with this article. Requests for copies of pay schedules must be presented to the employee's department head.
B.
When considering placement in the pay range for both new hires and promoted employees, department heads shall take into consideration relevant skill, required education, related ability, years of related experience, and any/all other qualifications required to perform the essential functions of the job, as well as the pay of other employees in the same department and pay grade, with strict adherence to the city/BLW's EEO policy (as stated in Article 4-4-4, Equal Employment Opportunity).
C.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, when considering placement in the pay range for both new hires and promoted employees, department heads shall also make every reasonable effort to avoid pay compression, defined for purposes of this article as most often resulting when:
1.
New hires or promoted employees are paid at or above the pay of existing employees with more experience or more responsibilities in the same position.
2.
New hires or promoted employees are paid at or above the pay of their supervisors/managers (when the new hires or promoted employees' routinely earned overtime compensation is included in the calculation).
If a department head is unable to effectuate the new hire or promotion without creating or contributing to existing pay compression, prior to effectuating the new hire or promotion, he/she must promptly notify the HR director who will consult with the city manager to discuss potential options and solutions.
(Ord. No. 8227 , 7/14/2021, § 1)
4-4-24-060 - Original appointments.
A.
Pay offered to newly hired employees shall be at an initial pay range that falls within the first quartile of the pay grade designated for his/her position, or is consistent with an approved schedule or program, with some exceptions as noted below.
B.
When the city/BLW is unable to recruit qualified applicants or when an applicant possesses exceptional qualifications warranting employment above the first quartile, the department head may request authorization from the HR director to hire up to the mid-point for technical and professional positions only. These positions are designated in the pay and classification plan as having an EEOC category of 01, 02, or 03.
C.
Requests to hire up to the mid-point of the pay grade for other positions requires the recommendation of the HR director and the authorization of the city manager and will be granted only in exceptional circumstances.
D.
Newly appointed personnel in a department head, managerial, or supervisory position may be compensated at any rate within the approved pay grade for the position as approved by the city manager so long as the salary does not exceed the maximum of the assigned pay grade.
E.
Appointments of candidates into a formal apprenticeship program or into a specific career development program, such as apprentice electrical line worker or line worker position, will be compensated according to pay and classification plan provisions specific to those programs as adopted by the city council.
F.
The HR director may authorize the hire of temporary employees at a rate of pay less than the minimum of the classification. Temporary employees on the city/BLW payroll shall be paid only for actual hours worked, inclusive of overtime, if any.
(Ord. No. 8227 , 7/14/2021, § 1)
4-4-24-070 - Trainee status.
Positions designated as trainee positions may be filled on a temporary basis, at a rate below the minimum salary of the pay grade. Pay rates shall be determined by the length of the training program so that, upon acquisition of required training and experience, the incumbent may be placed at the minimum salary in the pay grade.
(Ord. No. 8227 , 7/14/2021, § 1)
4-4-24-080 - Promotions.
A.
The movement of a current employee from a position in one pay grade to a position in a higher pay grade shall be considered a promotion. All promotions shall be made upon the recommendation of the department head and the HR director, subject to the approval of the city manager. Promotions will typically be made at an increase that falls within the higher pay grade's range and:
1.
Justification can clearly be demonstrated based on the employee's experience, education, skills, and abilities;
2.
With written consent of the HR director; and
3.
With approval of the city manager.
Employees in approved career development programs, progression ladders, step programs, or other specialized pay structures will be promoted and have salary set based on those approved guidelines.
B.
Current employees promoted or moved to supervisory positions shall be paid as provided in paragraph A of this section. For purposes of this article, "supervisory position" shall be defined as an employee who has supervisory authority and responsibility over one or more employees on a regular basis.
C.
As provided in Section 4-4-6-080, promoted employees shall serve a working test period, the duration of which is determined by the position occupied. The working test period in the promoted position may be extended by the department head, with the approval of the HR director, a maximum of an additional three-month period. Upon successful completion of the working test period, the promoted employee will be granted regular status in the new position. There is no salary increase at the end of the working test period for promoted employees.
(Ord. No. 8227 , 7/14/2021, § 1)
4-4-24-090 - Demotions.
Demotion is defined as the assignment of an employee from a position in one classification to a position in another classification assigned a lower pay grade. Demotion may be disciplinary or otherwise involuntary or it may be voluntary.
When an employee requests and receives approval of a voluntary demotion, he/she will be placed in the newly assigned pay grade for the lower position at a minimum of five percent less than his/her current rate of pay and within the approved range for the lower pay grade. However, if it can be demonstrated to be in the best interest of the city/BLW, and with the prior recommendation of the HR director and approval by the city manager, the employee may be paid at a rate that is within the approved range for the lower-level position that does not exceed the employee's pay in his/her previous position, or the employee's current pay rate may be frozen until the pay rate falls within the specified range of the lower assigned pay grade. Employees whose pay is frozen are ineligible for increases until their pay falls within the stated range.
If an employee is involuntarily demoted per Section 4-4-20-030, the department head, in consultation with the HR director, may recommend an appropriate rate of pay in the pay grade to which the employee has been assigned. However, the newly assigned rate of pay will be at least five percent lower than his/her previous rate.
(Ord. No. 8227 , 7/14/2021, § 1)
4-4-24-100 - Lateral transfers.
An employee who is transferred to a different position in the same pay grade as his/her current position may continue at his/her current pay rate if it can be demonstrated by the department head that the salary offered is appropriate based on the employee's skills, education, and experience as required by the job description.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the department head is unable to effectuate the transfer without creating or contributing to existing pay compression, prior to effectuating the transfer, he/she must promptly notify the HR director who will consult with the city manager to discuss potential options and solutions.
(Ord. No. 8227 , 7/14/2021, § 1)
4-4-24-110 - Reclassifications.
When an employee's position is reclassified to a lower grade and the employee's salary is above the maximum of the lower grade, the employee shall be permitted to continue at the rate of pay at the time of reclassification during the period of incumbency but shall not be entitled to any salary increases until the schedule is adjusted to include the employee's salary.
When an employee's position is approved by council to be reclassified to a higher pay grade, the incumbent will be placed in the newly assigned pay grade.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, when setting the pay for an employee whose position has been reclassified to a higher pay grade, the department head should make every effort to avoid creating or contributing to existing pay compression and, if unable to do so, must promptly notify the HR director who will consult with the city manager to discuss potential options and solutions.
(Ord. No. 8227 , 7/14/2021, § 1)
4-4-24-120 - Compensation policies and procedures.
A.
Overtime. The city/BLW will comply with the requirements as outlined in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), as amended, and the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) regulations pertaining thereto.
1.
Non-exempt employees, other than fire protection and law enforcement personnel, earn overtime compensation at 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a work week. The city/BLW will utilize a partial exemption from the overtime pay requirements of Section 7(k) of the FLSA for otherwise non-exempt fire protection and law enforcement personnel as defined in the FLSA and DOL regulations. Police officers have a work cycle of seven days and earn overtime compensation at 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of 43 hours in the seven-day work cycle. Firefighters have a work cycle of 21 days and earn overtime compensation at 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of 159 hours in the 21-day work cycle.
In the event any non-exempt firefighter remains on duty after the expiration of his/her regularly scheduled shift due to a bona fide emergency situation, as determined by the fire chief, such firefighter shall be compensated for such post-shift work at the overtime rate, regardless of whether such post-shift work places the firefighter in an overtime situation based on the defined work period as described above; provided, however, that in determining whether the firefighter is entitled to overtime pay for the work period, only the actual post-shift hours worked shall be counted.
2.
The list of exempt and non-exempt positions will be a part of the pay and classification plan established for each budget year. In accordance with the FLSA, employees who are classified as exempt are paid a fixed salary for each payroll period, except as otherwise permitted under the FLSA. Therefore, exempt employees who work in excess of the FLSA's threshold number of hours for overtime during a payroll period are not entitled to overtime compensation. In addition, exempt employees who work less than the number of hours contemplated by their schedules will not have their salary reduced except as otherwise permitted by the FLSA.
3.
The chief of police may allocate canine handlers pay to all police officers who are assigned as canine handlers and who are responsible for the at-home care of a bona fide departmental police dog. Canine handlers are paid for one additional hour per day at the officer's regular rate for reasons of care, boarding, and handling of the canines (including bathing, brushing, exercising, feeding, grooming, cleaning of the canine's kennel or transport vehicle, administering drugs or medicine to the canine for illness, and/or transporting the canine to or from an animal hospital or veterinarian as needed). Because the precise number of hours spent on these tasks is difficult or impossible to determine, this payment reflects a reasonable agreement between the canine handlers and the city, based on consideration of all pertinent facts, regarding the approximate number of hours the tasks are expected is take. The payment for one additional hour per day will be made seven days per week, regardless of whether the canine handler is on-duty or off-duty, on sick leave, or on vacation.
4.
The completion of time cards by exempt employees, including the accrual and usage of leave under city/BLW authorized leave programs, provides important records documenting and justifying the city/BLW's expenditures of public funds, and is necessary for the effective administration of city/BLW authorized leave programs. Therefore, the completion of time cards by non-exempt employees, including to note the accrual and use of leave under city/BLW authorized leave programs, or other indicators of the use of exempt employees' time, does not controvert an employee's exempt or salaried status.
5.
Department heads may require non-exempt employees to receive compensatory time instead of overtime pay.
6.
General non-exempt employees may accumulate a maximum of 240 hours of compensatory time. Non-exempt police and firefighting personnel may accumulate a maximum of 480 hours of compensatory time. Non-exempt employees who have attained the maximum compensatory time shall be paid overtime pay for all overtime hours worked until their compensatory time balances are reduced below the maximum.
To reduce compensatory time balances, department heads or their designees may require employees to schedule time off. Such employees may also be required to utilize their accrued compensatory time prior to other paid leave programs, unless such requirement would result in an employee forfeiting an equivalent accrual balance in those leave programs within the ensuing three months.
7.
All non-exempt employees shall be paid all accumulated balances of compensatory time upon termination of employment at a rate of compensation not less than:
a.
The average regular rate received by such employee during the last three years of the employee's employment; or
b.
The final regular rate received by such employee, whichever is higher.
8.
Exempt employees who are required or authorized to work more hours than the standard work period established for their position may accumulate non-FLSA compensatory time at the rate of one times the number of hours worked in excess of their standard workweek. There will be a maximum accumulation of 120 hours at any time during a calendar year. All such non-FLSA compensatory time earned by an exempt employee in any calendar year must either be utilized by March 31 of the following calendar year or be forfeited. No non-FLSA compensatory time will be paid to exempt employees at any time, including, but not limited to, at termination of employment or upon forfeiture.
9.
Deductions from Pay/Safe Harbor. The FLSA limits the types of deductions that may be made from the salary of an exempt employee. For instance, during the week an exempt employee begins work for the city or during his/her last week of employment, the employee will only be paid for actual hours worked. In addition, an exempt employee may be paid only for hours worked during a period when he/she is using unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Other deductions that are permitted include but are not limited to:
a.
Deductions that are required by law (e.g., income taxes);
b.
Deductions for employee benefits when authorized by the employee;
c.
Deductions due to absences from work for one or more full days for personal reasons other than sickness or disability;
d.
Deductions due to absences from work for one or more full days due to sickness or disability if the deduction is made in accordance with a bona fide plan, policy, or practice of providing compensation for salary lost due to illness;
e.
Unpaid disciplinary suspensions of one of more full days for violations infractions of safety rules of major significance; or
f.
Unpaid disciplinary suspensions of one or more full days for significant violations of major workplace conduct rules.
The city/BLW complies with the FLSA's salary basis requirements and does not make improper deductions from the salaries of exempt employees. Any exempt employee who has reason to believe that an improper deduction has been taken from his/her salary should promptly report the deduction utilizing the procedure set forth in Subsection (A)(10) below.
10.
Exempt employees may seek review of salary deductions through the following procedure.
Step 1: Division Level. An exempt employee who has reason to believe that an improper deduction has been taken from his/her salary should promptly report the matter to his/her division manager with a copy to the HR director. In submitting the report questioning a deduction(s), the employee should identify the specific deduction(s) in question and include a statement explaining why he/she believes that the deduction(s) was improper. The division manager will promptly investigate the report and issue a decision, in writing, to the employee, the department head, and the HR director within seven calendar days of receipt of the report.
Step 2: Department Level. If the matter is not resolved at Step 1, the exempt employee may request that his/her department head review the decision of the division manager by submitting a written request for review to the department head with a copy to the HR director. The department head will promptly review the division manager's decision and the underlying report and issue a decision, in writing, to the employee and the HR director within seven calendar days of receipt of the request for review.
Step 3: Director of Human Resources and Risk Management Level. If the matter is not resolved at Step 2, the exempt employee may request that the HR director review the decision of the department head by submitting a written request for review to the HR director. The HR director will promptly review the department head's decision and the underlying report and issue a decision, in writing, to the employee within seven calendar days of receipt of the request for review; provided, however, that if the HR director elects to consult with the city/BLW's labor counsel for a legal opinion on the matter, he/she may take such additional time as may be required for this purpose. This step is the final level of review, and the decision of the HR director shall not be grievable or appealable under Section 4-4-22 of the city/BLW's personnel rules and regulations.
If it is found that an improper deduction(s) has been made, the city/BLW will reimburse the employee for the improper deduction(s), and the HR director will take steps to ensure no recurrence of the improper deduction(s). Retaliation against any employee reporting a possible improper deduction is strictly prohibited.
11.
Employees may seek review of their classifications as exempt or non-exempt through the same procedure set forth in Section 4-4-24-120A(10) above. Such review shall be initiated through the submission of a written report, in which the employee should provide as much information as possible supporting his/her belief that he/she has been misclassified. The third step of the review process is the final level of review, and the decision of the HR director shall not be grievable or appealable under Section 4-4-22 of the city/BLW's personnel rules and regulations.
If it is found that the employee was misclassified as exempt, the classification will be corrected immediately and the HR director will make a recommendation to the city manager regarding any other action to be taken, including but not limited to, payment for any earned but unpaid overtime. Additionally, the change must be approved by the city council in accordance with Section 4-4-24-030(E). Retaliation against any employee reporting a possible exemption misclassification is strictly prohibited.
B.
Emergency Call-Out Pay for Non-Exempt Employees.
1.
If a non-exempt employee is officially ordered to and does report for duty of an unscheduled nature, he/she shall be compensated for a minimum of two and one-half hours at his/her overtime rate. Half an hour of the two- and one-half-hour minimum callback compensation is for travel time for an employee who is called back on the job and who does not have a city/BLW vehicle at home in which to respond to the call. If the employee does have a city/BLW vehicle at home in which to respond to the call, then such employee shall only be entitled to a minimum of two hours' call-back compensation at his/her overtime rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining whether the employee is entitled to overtime pay for the affected pay period, only the actual unscheduled time worked shall be counted.
To qualify for emergency call-out pay, the employee must be determined by his/her manager/supervisor to have reported promptly to the job site. In making this determination, the manager/supervisor shall take all relevant factors into consideration, including the time the employee began traveling to the job site and the distance traveled.
2.
For the purpose of calculating emergency call-out pay, a non-exempt employee shall be credited with hours worked from the time the employee is notified of the order to report for duty until the work is completed and the employee is no longer restricted from using his/her time for his/her own pursuits.
The employee's regularly defined workday, as established by individual departments, shall be used to define a 24-hour work period in determining callback pay. Before returning home from an emergency call-out, the employee is required to check with his/her manager/supervisor or, if applicable, with the dispatcher for other calls and if none, notify the manager/supervisor or, if applicable, dispatcher that he/she is going off duty or other appropriate status.
3.
Non-Emergency Call-Out Pay. If a non-exempt employee is required to and does report back to work at a pre-designated time, the employee will receive a minimum of one hour credited to his/her work period.
C.
Measuring Employee Performance.
1.
The city/BLW encourages the use of annual performance evaluations, which serves as a valuable tool for identifying and recognizing highly performing employees, for providing redirection, training, or other remedial measures to employees who are not achieving performance goals and objectives or otherwise meeting expectations in one or more areas, for establishing a record of performance to assist in making future personnel decisions, among other useful purposes. Department heads who choose not to use annual performance evaluations are required to implement and consistently utilize a reasonable performance management process within their departments, whether formal or informal, designed to serve the above-described functions (including creating a record of performance).
2.
Employees in an apprenticeship/career development program will be reviewed in accordance with their respective programs and may be granted increases in compensation as provided by those programs, if funded by the city council.
3.
Merit increases, if authorized and approved, are based upon the employee's performance as determined by his/her supervisor and department head on the employee's performance evaluation or other performance management process utilized in the employee's department. Employees may attach a response to their performance evaluations or other relevant records of performance to be included in their personnel files, but performance evaluations and other records of performance may not be grieved past Step 2 of the city/BLW grievance procedure contained in Section 4-4-22-030.
D.
Longevity Pay.
1.
Employees who have completed at least five years of continuous service with the city/BLW are eligible for longevity pay.
2.
The amount of longevity pay will be apportioned by five-year increments up to a maximum of 25 years. The dollar amount allocated for each five-year increment of service by the employee will be determined as part of the budget approved annually by the city council.
3.
All longevity pay will be distributed in a block amount on the scheduled pay period immediately following the employee's employment anniversary date.
E.
Working Out of Classification.
1.
An employee who is designated by their department head as working out of classification will be compensated at five percent above his/her regular rate of pay for each day so designated unless limited by the maximum pay in the higher pay grade. An employee must work out of classification at least two full consecutive days or a 24-hour period for firefighters to be eligible for out of classification pay. Eligible employees will be compensated for each day worked out of their normal classification. No out of classification pay will be paid to employees required to act in an equal or lower classification as determined by pay grade.
2.
Employees who work out of classification for 30 days or more are to be compensated at the minimum rate of the assigned higher class or five percent above their regular rate of pay, whichever is greater, unless limited by the maximum pay in the higher pay grade. In special circumstances, the department head can recommend adding an additional five percent to the figure through the HR director with approval of the city manager.
F.
Required Court Appearance. Employees required to testify or give a deposition on behalf of the city/BLW or because of conduct arising out of and in the course of employment with the city/BLW in connection with a judicial or administrative proceeding shall be paid for all hours required for such testimony or deposition, but non-exempt employees will receive a minimum of two hours credited to their regular work periods if any required appearances occur during their off duty hours, unless the required appearance is immediately before or immediately after the regular workday, in which case such time will be added to their actual hours worked for the pay period.
Any witness fees or other fees that the employee receives for this appearance shall be endorsed and promptly transmitted by the employee to his/her department head for forwarding to the finance department.
G.
Police Shift Differential Pay.
1.
Police officers and full-time civilian transport officers who work the hours of 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., will earn an additional $0.50 per hour for increased risks and hazards in their occupation.
2.
Police officers and full-time civilian transport officers who work the hours of 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. will earn an additional $1.00 per hour for increased risks and hazards of their occupation.
3.
A maximum of eight hours' shift differential pay may be earned in a 24-hour period.
4.
Assignment to a shift shall not vest a police officer or full-time civilian transport officer with a vested right to work a particular shift or to receive shift differential pay if reassigned to a different shift.
H.
Standby Pay.
1.
Employees placed on standby status are those directed to be available by telephone, pager, beeper, police radio or other means of communication so that they are available for and capable of reporting for work within a reasonable period of time. Department heads shall designate the positions and eligible employees for standby status as needed and in writing to the department of human resources and risk management and the finance department.
2.
Non-exempt employees who are placed on standby status are entitled to standby pay. Employees who are on standby and fail to respond to a call for duty shall forfeit all standby pay for the assigned period and may be subject to disciplinary action.
3.
Compensation for an employee serving standby duty will be at a rate of eight hours of pay at their regular rate for one week of standby duty served. Such hours shall be paid at the normal rate of pay (straight time) but shall not be included in the calculation of hours worked by the employee during the relevant pay period. Exempt employees will accrue eight hours' non-FLSA compensatory leave for one week of standby duty served. Standby time of less than seven days shall be credited on a proportionate basis.
4.
In the event a non-exempt employee is called back to duty while on standby status, the employee shall receive compensation for actual hours worked at one and one-half times his/her normal rate of pay. If exempt employees are called back to duty while on standby status, they shall accrue non-FLSA compensatory time as provided in this section.
5.
Compensation for police department personnel regarding court attendance will be in accordance with the FLSA. The department will develop and update procedures as necessary to carry out this purpose.
