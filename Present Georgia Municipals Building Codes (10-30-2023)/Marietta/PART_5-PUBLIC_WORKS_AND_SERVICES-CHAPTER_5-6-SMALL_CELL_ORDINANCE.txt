5-6-060 - Requirements for small wireless facilities in the right-of-way.
A.
All small wireless facilities shall require an attachment agreement or other authorization for placement on the pole or wireless support structure and shall be subject to the following requirements, except that any small wireless facility proposed to be located in a protected area, as identified on the map described in Subsection B., shall comply with the requirements of that section to the extent they differ from the requirement below:
1.
Installations in/on utility poles not located within protected areas shall be limited to in-line tangent poles without transformers and those classified as secondary service poles.
2.
To the greatest extent practical, antennas shall not be perceptible by an average person from 250 feet away; if a dispute arises as to this paragraph, the public works director will make the final determination as to compliance with this paragraph. All location decisions shall be addressed in a nondiscriminatory manner and consistent with applicable law.
3.
Small wireless facility installations on all poles shall utilize a concealed design, with all cabling being inside a hollow pole or otherwise hidden from view without banding or external conduit or panduit.
4.
All radios, network equipment and batteries will be enclosed inside the pole or on the pole inside a concealment device approved by the city public works department.
5.
All SWF shall be designed in a manner that does not endanger public safety or impede traffic flow on roads and sidewalks.
6.
Any new poles installed shall not leach any volatile organic compounds or toxic materials.
7.
Any new poles installed should be constructed in a manner to avoid unsightly rust and corrosion. The finish on the pole should conform to city standards, including selection of color, finish method, such as "baked on" or color that is tightly integrated into the material composition of the pole to prevent color fading or erosion or peeling of paint from the exterior of the pole.
8.
Any SWF placed on a city-owned pole shall not interfere with or block any banners or other attachments owned by the city. The small wireless facility shall be aesthetically compatible with the surrounding area through application of camouflage and concealment design techniques.
9.
Any new, modified, or replacement pole or wireless support structure installed in the rights-of-way located outside of a protected area shall not exceed five feet above the tallest pre-existing poles or wireless support structures within 200 feet of the proposed new wireless facility, located on the same side of the street and within the same right-of-way, except that no pole shall exceed 65 feet above ground level (AGL).
10.
Any poles located in protected areas or streetscaped corridors, shall be consistent in height with the other decorative poles located therein. The city shall not allow new poles in any protected area without a variance from city council, which may only be granted upon a showing by the WIP that service to the area would be effectively prohibited without the installation of a new pole, and any replacement poles must match the height of the existing pole it replaces.
11.
Applicant shall comply with all requirements set forth in the city's underground utility ordinance. The provisions of the city's underground utility ordinance shall be applied in a manner consistent with its application other utility providers that use the city's rights-of-way and in such a way that does not effectively prohibit service within the area of the proposed facility.
12.
Any small wireless facilities proposed to be located within 250 feet of another small wireless facility shall be collocated with other small wireless facilities or neutrally hosted, unless applicant provides sufficient evidence that coverage and capacity needs cannot be met using collocated or neutrally hosted wireless attachments; any small wireless facilities shall be designed and constructed in a manner that allows other competing wireless infrastructure providers and carriers to be collocated on/in the same pole or placed on/in nearby poles. All location decisions shall be addressed in a nondiscriminatory manner and consistent with applicable law. It is the express intent of this chapter that in areas where one WIP has installed SWF, all providers and carriers be shall permitted to install SWF in the same area consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including 47 U.S. Code § 224, and other applicable provisions. To the extent such collocation or nearby placement is not feasible in certain rights-of-way, all wireless infrastructure providers shall be prohibited from installing SWF in that area of the right-of-way, and the public works department has authority to deny or revoke any permits for SWF in that area if it is shown that WIP are being blocked by competing WIP from locating there. As SWF technology continues to develop and smaller and more concealed designs are available, the city may review permits and require that WIP upgrade older SWF so that more WIP may collocate and/or decrease the footprint of SWF in the rights-of-way.
B.
Protected Areas.
1.
The city has invested significant capital and regulatory efforts over many years to promote economic and community development, support the preservation of historic and natural resources, and remedy potential blight through redevelopment initiatives. In keeping with this effort to protect these significant investments in sensitive areas, the city council may designate certain areas of the city in which in which streetscaping, historic preservation, redevelopment efforts, or other zoning and land use considerations require the design and construction of small wireless facilities in a manner that conforms to the existing aesthetic and structural schemes. The regulations adopted to protect these areas will be applied in a manner consistent with the city's regulation of other utility providers that use the city's rights-of-way and in such a way that does not effectively prohibit service within these areas.
2.
The protected areas are identified on the protected area maps included with this chapter and adopted concurrently herewith. The city council may update the protected area maps as additional areas within the city are designated as protected areas. The public works department shall maintain a corresponding list of city-approved pole(s) for each protected area identified on the map.
3.
Small wireless facilities located in protected areas with existing decorative poles shall use poles that conform to the height and aesthetics of the existing decorative poles. The public works department shall maintain a list of city-approved poles for each protected area and a list of design specifications for SWF placed in each protected area, including height limits, equipment placement, and concealment requirements.
4.
Any poles located in protected areas or streetscaped corridors shall be consistent in height with the other decorative poles located therein. The city shall not allow new poles in any protected area without a variance from city council which may only be granted upon a showing by the WIP that service to the area would be effectively prohibited without the installation of a new pole, and any replacement poles must match the height of the existing pole it replaces.
5.
Pole-mounted cabinets approved by the city in protected areas shall conform to the design and placement specifications determined by the public works department for each protected area and cabinets on the ground are prohibited altogether in protected areas.
6.
Where the city has or hereafter decides to relocate utility facilities underground or replace poles with decorative poles, the city shall designate such area as a protected area and shall work with the wireless infrastructure provider to accommodate placement of SWF on city-approved poles within that area provided the SWF conform to poles used in the area. In order to place to place any SWF on a pole that has not been approved by the city for use in the protected area, WIP must seek a variance from the city council, which shall only be granted upon a showing that service to the area would be effectively prohibited without the use of the non-approved pole.

5-6-070 - Effect of permit and construction requirements.
A.
Authority Granted: No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A permit from the city authorizes an applicant to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this chapter and does not create a property right or grant any authority whatsoever to the applicant to impinge upon the rights of others who may already have an interest in the rights-of-way.
B.
Duration. Unless construction has actually begun and is diligently pursued to completion at that point, no permit for construction issued under this chapter shall be valid for a period longer than 12 months unless both city and applicant agree to a reasonable extension and all required fees are paid for the term regardless of construction.
C.
Public Safety and Traffic. Construction and maintenance of SWF shall be performed in a manner that does not endanger public safety and that minimizes interference with traffic flow. Where permittee must disrupt traffic flow, appropriate safety and traffic flow measures shall be employed to safeguard against accidents and keep traffic moving in an efficient manner.
D.
Condition of Right-of-Way. Upon completion of any construction or maintenance of its small wireless facilities, the wireless infrastructure provider must return the surface of the city's right-of-way to its prior condition, including any sidewalks, curbing, paving, landscaping or other improvements in place prior to the construction. WIP shall not leave sidewalks in an uneven condition and shall use similar materials and construction in its repair of the right-of-way such that the appearance of the improvements is substantially identical to its prior condition. If the right-of-way is not returned to a substantially identical condition after construction or maintenance activities, the city may, in its sole discretion, request the WIP to make the appropriate repairs within five days of receiving notice from the city. If the repairs are not made by the WIP within said time, the city may perform the repairs on its own and require reimbursement of any expenses associated therewith. When such repairs are made by the city, written notice shall be sent requesting reimbursement upon completion of the repairs, and WIP shall have 30 days to reimburse such expenses from the sending of the notice.
E.
Construction and Maintenance Exclusions. The city retains the authority to exclude certain days, holidays and special events periods during which the wireless infrastructure provider may not perform construction or maintenance activities on its small wireless facilities and must be out of the rights-of-way. The public works department may also require that WIP and their agents not perform construction or maintenance work during certain times of the day in order to lessen the impact on traffic or otherwise address safety concerns. Such times shall be as approved by the city council or the public works director. Prior to commencing construction or maintenance, permittee or its agent must verify that its planned work does not fall into an excluded time period.
F.
Compliance with ADA. Any small wireless facilities or associated construction and maintenance activities must comply with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) (29 U.S.C. § 794) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131—12164). The city shall not be liable for any small wireless facilities or any actions of the WIP which violate the ADA. If at any time the city determines the right-of-way is not in compliance due to the actions or facilities of WIP, the city may, in its sole discretion, request the WIP to make the appropriate repairs within five days of sending of the notice from the city. If the repairs are not made by the WIP, the city may perform the repairs on its own and require reimbursement of any expenses associated therewith. When such repairs are made by the city, written notice shall be sent requesting reimbursement upon completion of the repairs, and WIP shall have 30 days to reimburse such expenses from the sending of the notice.

5-6-090 - Removal, relocation or modification of a small wireless facility in the ROW.
A.
General Relocation Policy.
1.
In the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, consistent with the city's ordinances and master plans, and in the reasonable exercise of its police powers, the city may make or cause to be made improvements, repairs, or replacements of the public facilities located on public rights-of-way. Such construction activity may require adjustment or relocation of installations of public utilities, and small wireless facilities owned and maintained by wireless service providers. The city deems the right of public utilities to use public rights-of-way to be permissive and subordinate to the reasonable exercise of the city's police power. Thus, the cost of relocating a small wireless facility installation when the city reasonably exercises its police power shall be borne by the wireless infrastructure provider. In such instances, the city shall work in good faith with the wireless providers to identify and provide suitable alternative locations for the placement of the removed wireless facilities if available and consistent with this chapter. The city's relocation policy will be applied in a manner consistent with the city's relocation of other utility providers that use the city's rights-of-way and in such a way that does not effectively prohibit service within these area of the project requiring relocation.
2.
Whenever the city determines that relocation of a SWF is necessary under this provision, the city shall give WIP 60 days' notice within which to relocate or otherwise remove the SWF. Should the wireless infrastructure provider not relocate as directed by the city, the city may disconnect and remove the wireless attachment, ancillary equipment or the entire small wireless facility at the wireless infrastructure provider's expense. When such removal is performed by the city, written notice shall be sent requesting reimbursement after completion of the removal, and WIP shall have 30 days to reimburse such expenses after the sending of the notice. Failure to timely reimburse shall terminate right to be in city ROW.
B.
Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The city retains the right to cut or move or disconnect any small wireless facility located within its rights-of-way as the city, in its sole discretion, may determine to be necessary, appropriate, or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the city shall notify the wireless infrastructure provider and provide it an opportunity to move its own small wireless facility, prior to the city cutting or removing such facility and the city shall notify the wireless infrastructure provider after cutting or removing the small wireless facility. The city shall not be liable for any damages to small wireless facilities or other infrastructure that is cut or removed during such emergencies. When such removal is performed by the city, written notice shall be sent requesting reimbursement after completion of the removal, and WIP shall have 30 days to reimburse such expenses after the sending of the notice.
(Ord. No. 8001, 1/10/2018, § 1; Ord. No. 8124 , 12/11/2019, § 1)
5-6-100 - Change of law.
A permit for the placement of small wireless facilities within the city rights-of-way may include a provision reasonably addressing the obligations of the parties if there is a substantial change of law at the federal, state, or local level.
(Ord. No. 8001, 1/10/2018, § 1; Ord. No. 8124 , 12/11/2019, § 1)
5-6-110 - Periodic review.
The city may, in its sole discretion, review the terms and conditions of any permit issued pursuant to this chapter after five years to determine if the terms and conditions for the use of city rights-of-way are still in the best interests of the city pursuant to the laws and regulations in effect at the time. If it is determined by the city that the terms and conditions of the permit are no longer in the best interest of the city under the terms of this chapter, it may revoke the permit or may make changes to the permit as necessary to meet the best interests of the city.
(Ord. No. 8001, 1/10/2018, § 1; Ord. No. 8124 , 12/11/2019, § 1)
5-6-120 - Fees and rentals.
The following fee schedule establishes the fees and an annual payment or lease of city rights-of-way for small wireless facilities as follows:
1.
Application Fees. Except as otherwise provided by Subsection 2., all applications for permits pursuant to this chapter shall be accompanied by a fee for actual, direct, and reasonable costs incurred by the city related to processing the application, but shall not exceed $250.00 each for up to five identical or similar small wireless facilities on existing pole locations addressed in the application and $100.00 for each additional application for similar small wireless facilities. If an application requests a new pole then the application shall be $1,000.00.
2.
Use of Right-of-Way City Property Rental Rates. A wireless provider authorized to place small wireless facilities in the rights-of-way shall pay to the city compensation for use of the rights-of-way in the amount of $270.00 annually per small wireless facility.
3.
Annual Rate for City. The annual rate to attach or collocate a small wireless facility on a city-owned pole shall be negotiated through a wireless attachment agreement with the city and will not exceed $50.00 per small wireless facility per year. The rights-of-way fee specified in this chapter shall be the sole compensation that the wireless infrastructure provider shall be required to pay the city or utility; provided, if the wireless infrastructure provider is also installing its own fiber optic technology to a particular location, the wireless infrastructure provider shall also provide the city with an opportunity to lay conduit and/or fiber for city use, at the city's expense, to the aforementioned location utilizing any open trenching or boring construction by the wireless infrastructure provider during the wireless infrastructure provider's installation, including stubbing up the conduit within the city-approved pole.
4.
Right of Wireless Provider to Cease Payment. A wireless infrastructure provider is authorized to remove its wireless attachments and ancillary equipment at any time from the pole in the rights-of-way or other wireless support structure and may cease paying the city compensation for use of the rights-of-way as of the next due date for payment following the removal if all equipment is removed.
