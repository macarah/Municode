2) Towers or antennas shall be set back from any property line a distance equal to the height of the tower or antenna.
3) Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
4) At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
5) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely compatible with the color or the supporting structure to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
6) Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
7) Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than 6 feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device.
8) Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that provides a solid visual screen from adjacent residential property. The standards buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least 5 feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound.
9) In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirements may be reduced or waived
10) Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer.
