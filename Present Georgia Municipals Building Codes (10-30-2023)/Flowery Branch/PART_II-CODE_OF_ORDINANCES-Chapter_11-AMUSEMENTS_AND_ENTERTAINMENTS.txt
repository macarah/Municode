(Ord. No. 106, § 3, 11-7-1994)
Sec. 11-3. - Regulation of the operation of amusement machines.
Every person operating amusement machines within the corporate limits of the city, including music amusement machines, billiards, video poker amusement machines, and amusement rides, but not including exempt machines, shall only operate said machines in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The regulation as set out in this chapter is necessitated by the potential abuse of minors due to their fascination with said machines and also by the easy use of said machines as gambling devices. Therefore, said machines shall only be operated within the corporate limits of the city in accordance with this chapter. In assessing the need for proper regulations, the city council has determined that these proper public concerns, except as for billiards and video poker amusement machines, do not require as much regulatory oversight when only one amusement machine or one music amusement machine is in operation on a premises. The city council finds that the operation of more than one amusement machine on one premises or the operation of a gameroom, or both, holds a special attraction for minors who are not as capable of exercising good judgment as adults and, therefore, necessitate regulation by the city. Further, the city council finds that billiards and video poker amusement machines are extremely susceptible to being used as gambling devices and also require regulation by the city.
(Ord. No. 106, § 4, 11-7-1994)
Sec. 11-4. - License required.
Every person operating an amusement machine, a music amusement machine, a billiard room, a video poker amusement machine, or an amusement ride, or any combination thereof, shall be required to obtain a regulatory license from the city for the operation of said machine (including, but not limited to, a billiard table) within the corporate limits of the city. Application for such regulatory license shall be made to the city council upon a form to be supplied by the city clerk for that purpose.
(Ord. No. 106, § 5, 11-7-1994)
Sec. 11-5. - Qualifications for regulatory license.
(a)
Initial application. Every person that applies for said regulatory license as required by section 11-4 shall be at least 21 years of age and shall make application on forms furnished by the city clerk or other properly designated agent of the city council, and in connection therewith shall, under oath, answer all questions, supply all information, and furnish all certificates, affidavits, bonds, and other supporting data as required thereby. In all cases where the person operating the amusement machines, music amusement machines, billiard room, video poker amusement machines, or amusement rides, or any combination thereof, is a resident individual, the application shall be made in the resident's name. Where the operator of said machines (including, but not limited to, a billiard table) is a corporation, partnership, association, or nonresident, the application shall be made in the name of an officer, partner, or associate who owns a substantial interest in the business or in the name of the principal managing officer or agent and the application shall show that the license is for the use of the person operating said machines, and the person shall be named. The written application for the license shall be a permanent record which the licensee must maintain current as required by subsection (a)(1) of this section. Failure to maintain a current license application as required by this section shall be grounds for revocation of same. The following provisions shall apply:
(1)
No person shall have, own, or enjoy any ownership or interest in, or share in the profits from, or otherwise participate in the operation of amusement machines, billiard rooms, music amusement machines, video poker amusement machines, or amusement rides, or any combination thereof, within the corporate limits unless a full description of such interest shall have been furnished to the city council at the time such interest arose. It shall be the duty of the licensee to report to the city council within five days any change in any interest in such licensee's business including, but not limited to:
a.
Any division of the profits;
b.
Any division of net or gross sales for any purpose whatsoever;
c.
Any change in the payment of rents or leases;
d.
Any change in the ownership of any lease or building or land used in such business;
e.
Any change in the ownership of any corporation that has any interest in such business or the change of management of such corporation.
(2)
After receipt of such notice, the city council shall notify such person within a reasonable time of any objection to the ownership or interest set forth therein, and it shall then be incumbent upon such person to dispose of such interest within 30 days after the mailing of notice to do so by the city council to such person at his address as shown on such notice of interest. In the event such interest is not disposed of within 30 days after the mailing of notice by the city council, or in the event no objections are filed within said 30-day period, or in the event such person fails to notify the city council of the transfer of any such interest within 20 days after the acquisition thereof, the license as provided for herein may be revoked by the city council until disposition of the interest has been made or notice given to the city council of the transfer.
(3)
The report required by subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be in the form required by the city council and shall be an amendment to the licensee's permanent license application on file with the city council and, as such, shall be under oath and verified as otherwise required of license applications.
(b)
Renewal application. The city regulatory license issued shall be valid only for the calendar year indicated thereon. A licensee that desires to continue in business during the next or subsequent calendar year must make a renewal application for such year on or before November 15 of the preceding year. All applications for the renewal of licenses shall be treated as applications for new licenses, except that they need not be advertised (where required). Payment of license fees for renewal of licenses may be made at the time of application or by December 31 and, upon approval of renewal by the city council and payment of the regulatory fee, the license will be issued or resurveyed. The following conditions shall apply:
(1)
No city regulatory license may be transferred from one person to another or from one location to another without permission and approval of the city council upon written application made. Approval as to any change shall be at the discretion of the city council.
(2)
Each application for transfer of a license shall have attached thereto a completed copy of any notice of change of interest required by the state revenue commissioner. After receipt of such application, the city council shall notify such applicant within 20 days of any objection to the transfer as set forth in the application. Said license shall remain in effect pending approval of the transfer. Upon proper application, the city council may permit the license to be transferred upon payment of the regulatory license fees required under section 11-8. Upon the death of any license holder, his personal representatives or his heirs may continue to operate under said license for the balance of the year without the payment of any fee, if otherwise qualified as license holders, or the license may be transferred to a qualified transferee within 30 days after condition of the estate of the deceased licensee will permit, upon payment of the transfer fee.
(3)
Any licensee desiring to discontinue business at one location and commence business at some other location must make a complete new application for such location.
(c)
Denial of application. When contrary to the public interest and welfare, no license to operate amusement machines, music amusement machines, amusement rides, billiard rooms, billiards tables, or video poker amusement machines, or any combination thereof, shall be issued by the city council to or for:
(1)
Any person, as determined by the city council by reason of such person's business experience, financial standing, trade associations, personal associations, record of arrest, or reputation in any community in which he has resided, who is not likely to maintain the operation for which he is seeking a license in conformity with federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations;
(2)
Any person who has been convicted under any federal, state, or local law of any felony involving moral turpitude;

Any person convicted under any federal, state, or local law of a misdemeanor, particularly, but not limited to, those involving misuse of amusement machines, misuse of video poker amusement machines, misuse of billiard tables, gambling devices, alcoholic beverages, gambling, or tax law violations, if such conviction tends to indicate that the applicant will not maintain the operation for which he is seeking a license in conformity with federal, state, or local laws, rules and regulations;
(5)
A location at which the operation of the proposed business would be in violation of the zoning ordinances of the city;
(6)
A location at which a previous regulatory license has been revoked or suspended and where, in the judgment of the city council, the problems which have arisen from the operation of a license at such location indicate that it is not in the interest of public health, safety, welfare, or morals that said machines or billiards, or any combination thereof, be operated at such location;
(7)
Which the granting of such license would constitute a violation of state law or regulations.
(d)
Written notice of denial. Before the city council shall deny any application for a license or for the transfer of any license, or shall revoke any existing license, the applicant or licensee, as the case may be, shall be given notice in writing from the city clerk to show cause before the city council at a time and place specified not less than three days nor more than ten days from the date of service of the notice why said application for license or for transfer of license should not be denied or why said license should not be revoked, as the case may be, stating the grounds therefor, and at the appointed time and place the applicant or licensee shall have an opportunity to show cause, if any exists, why said application should not be denied or said license revoked, after which the city council shall take such action as it, in its judgment and discretion, shall deem warranted under the facts. The hearing herein provided for need not be at a regular meeting of the city council but may be at such time and place as shall be fixed in said notice. All decisions denying, approving, suspending, or revoking any regulatory license or application shall be in writing with the reasons therefor stated and mailed or delivered to the applicant or licensee, as the case may be. In addition, at any hearing as provided herein, the party afforded the hearing shall have the opportunity to present evidence and cross examine opposing witnesses.

(Ord. No. 106, § 7, 11-7-1994)
Sec. 11-7. - Short-form applications; contents and terms.
(a)
In the event the applicant is seeking a regulatory license for only one amusement machine, music amusement machine, or amusement ride, the application shall be made in person by the applicant to the city clerk or other properly designated agent of the city council, in writing on forms furnished by the city, signed by the applicant and contain, but not be restricted to, the following statements and information:
(1)
Said applicant shall provide the same information as required by section 11-6(a)(1) through (7). It is the intent of the city council that where only one amusement machine, one music amusement machine, or one amusement ride is to be operated by the applicant, the applicant need not provide a financial statement to the city council, nor submit detailed plans of the building or structure (although the building must still meet the city building code), nor submit to any fingerprinting as a part of the application.
(2)
Further, an applicant who may properly submit a short-form application also shall not be required to run any notice of said application in the newspaper, as set out in section 11-6(b). The short-form application shall contain all of the other information and statements as required by section 11-6 and shall be subject to all of the other terms and conditions as set out by section 11-6.
(b)
An applicant for the operation of only one billiard table or one video poker amusement machine shall be required to submit a regulatory license application pursuant to section 11-6 and have said license contain all of the contents required of such applications under section 11-6 and meet all of the terms and conditions of section 11-6 and all other requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 106, § 8, 11-7-1994)
Sec. 11-8. - Regulatory fees.
(a)
As a part of its exercise of its police power and as a part of or as an aid to regulation of said amusement machines, music amusement machines, billiard rooms, video poker amusement machines, or amusement rides, or any combination thereof, every applicant shall pay an annual regulatory license fee before being granted a regulatory license, in accordance with the schedule set out herein, for the privilege of operating said machines (including billiard tables) within the corporate limits of the city. The amount of said regulatory fees approximates the reasonable cost of the actual regulatory activity performed by the city which includes, but is not limited to, the review of the operations of the applicant to be sure that said applicant complies with this chapter and that the applicant is not using or permitting the use of said machines as gambling devices or for gambling purposes, or both. The regulatory license fees which shall be paid by the applicant shall be as established by the city council from time to time.
(b)
The city council finds that the regulatory license fees assessed for each video poker amusement machine and each billiard table are necessary due to the intensive regulatory activity necessitated by said machines due to the easy use of said machines as gambling devices. Further, due to the nature of billiards and video poker amusement machines, besides being extremely susceptible to being used as gambling devices, said machines are also extremely susceptible to being repeatedly played as gambling devices to the detriment of the user. For these reasons, the regulatory fee is higher in an attempt to offset the regulatory expense incurred by the city in ensuring that the machines are being properly used for amusement and not as gambling devices.
(Ord. No. 106, § 9, 11-7-1994)
Sec. 11-9. - Gambling devices not permitted.
Amusement machines, music amusement machines, amusement rides, billiard tables, or video poker amusement machines, or any combination thereof, shall not be used, or allowed to be used, by the operator as gambling devices or for gambling purposes, or both. This chapter shall not be construed in any fashion to authorize, license, or permit gambling or any gambling devices, or both, within the corporate limits of the city (except as authorized by state law). Any amusement machine, music amusement machine, amusement ride, billiard table, or video poker amusement machine, or any combination thereof, that is used, or permitted to be used, by the operator for gambling purposes or as a gambling device, or both, shall be subject to confiscation by any proper law enforcement officer and agency and shall be grounds for the immediate termination of the regulatory license to operate said machine (including billiard table).
(Ord. No. 106, § 10, 11-7-1994)
Sec. 11-10. - Regulatory license a privilege.
The operation of amusement machines, music amusement machines, amusement rides, billiard rooms, or video poker amusement machines, or any combination thereof, in the city is a privilege, and not a right, and the issuance of a regulatory license hereunder shall not create any property or right in the licensee except to conduct the licensed business during the period the license is in effect.
(Ord. No. 106, § 11, 11-7-1994)
Sec. 11-11. - Regulations.
(a)
No holder of a regulatory license authorizing the operation of amusement machines, music amusement machines, amusement rides, billiard rooms, or video poker amusement machines, or any combination thereof, within the corporate limits of the city, nor any agent or employee of the licensee, shall do any of the following upon the licensed premises:
(1)
When otherwise authorized under chapter 8, Alcoholic Beverages, as to the sale of alcoholic beverages, knowingly sell, serve, or permit the use of alcoholic beverages by the drink for consumption on the premises unless the licensee derives at least 75 percent of its revenue from the sale of products or services other than alcoholic beverages. This subsection shall control over any provision of chapter 8. This provision shall not apply where the licensee operates three or fewer amusement machines or music amusement machines, or any combination thereof, on the premises, but the licensee must meet the revenue requirements under chapter 8 for sale by the drink for consumption on the premises in the city. All other terms and conditions of chapter 8 shall apply as to any premises which sells alcoholic beverages.
(2)

Knowingly permit or cause to be permitted by any person in the licensee's employ a minor to be upon the premises during days and hours of operation of any public school system within the city.

(10)
Permit any person to operate said machines on the premises without proper clothing (being proper dress of shirt, blouse, pants, shorts, skirt, and shoes, as applicable).
(11)
No person shall allow or require a person in his employment under 18 years of age to sell or dispense coins, bills, other money, tokens, plates, discs, slugs, tickets, or other similar objects to operate said machines or to perform employment duties as to or concerning said machines. No holder of a regulatory license shall employ a person under 18 years of age. If the licensee sells alcoholic beverages by the drink for consumption on the premises, any person in the employment of said licensee on the premises must be at least 21 years of age.
(b)
The following shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation, or both, of said regulatory license. Whether or not said grounds exist shall be determined by the city council in its sole discretion:
(1)
The violation by the license holder or his employee of any state or federal law or any ordinance of the city, other than traffic violations. The determination of whether any such violation has occurred shall be made by the city council, and an actual conviction in a court for such offense shall not be necessary in order to suspend or revoke the license.
(2)
The failure of the license holder or his employee to report promptly to the proper law enforcement authorities any violation of law or municipal ordinance, breach of the peace, disturbance or altercation resulting in violence occurring on the premises.
(3)
Any conduct on the part of the license holder or his employee contrary to the public welfare, safety, health or morals.

Sec. 11-13. - General provisions.
(a)
Where applicable, when the holder of the regulatory license sells, serves, or permits the use of alcoholic beverages by the drink for consumption on the premises, and the 75 percent revenue requirement as provided by section 11-11(a)(1) is required, the 75 percent revenue requirement shall be determined on a calendar basis by a monthly report submitted by each licensee permitting such sales of alcoholic beverages. In the event that the 75 percent revenue requirement required by section 11-11(a)(1) falls below 75 percent of the business volume of alcoholic beverage sales for any quarter, the license holder shall be placed on probation for the next succeeding quarter. At the end of the next succeeding quarter, if the license holder's revenue from the sale of products or services, other than alcoholic beverages, has not obtained the 75 percent requirement, the mayor shall suspend said license in accordance with section 11-12(a). At the hearing before the city council in accordance with section 11-5(d), the city council, in its discretion, may revoke the regulatory license for noncompliance with the 75 percent revenue requirement of section 11-11(a)(1). Nothing herein provided shall prohibit the city council or the mayor from suspending or revoking said license for any other violations of this chapter. Authorized officials or agents, or both, of the city may examine the records of the licensee at any reasonable time to ascertain that the requirements of this and other provisions of this chapter are met.
(b)
All of said machines shall be operated only on the premises for which the regulatory license is issued.
(c)
The holder of every regulatory license hereunder shall have available in his place of business at all times a copy of this chapter and shall be responsible for compliance herewith by persons on the premises.
(d)
Premises operated under the provisions of this chapter shall be open to inspection by authorized personnel of the city at all times.
(e)
Upon receipt by the city clerk or any other properly designated agent of the city council of any application for a regulatory license (except as to those licenses as to which an applicant may submit a short-form application) or for the transfer of any license (except as to those licenses as to which an applicant may submit a short-form application), the clerk or proper agent of the city council shall forward the same to any proper law enforcement authority for investigation, who, following such investigation, shall attach thereto the entire police record of every person named in said application. The city clerk or other proper agent of the city council shall then submit the application with said report attached to the city council.
