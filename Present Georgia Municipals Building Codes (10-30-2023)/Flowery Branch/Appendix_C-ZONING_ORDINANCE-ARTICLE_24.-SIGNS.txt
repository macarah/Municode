--- (9) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 348-18 , § 1 (Exh. A), adopted Sept. 6, 2018, repealed former Art. 24, §§ 24.1—24.33, and enacted a new Art. 24 as set out herein. Former Art. 24 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 348-12, § 1, 5-19-2011.

Sec. 24.1. - Objectives.
The objectives of this Article include but are not limited to the following:
(a)
Provide a reasonable balance between the right of an individual to identify his or her business or express their thoughts and the right of the public to be protected against the visual discord resulting from the unrestricted proliferation of signs and advertising devices.
(b)
Guard against an excess of large, aesthetically unappealing, and/or intense signs which cause visual blight on the appearance of the community. Visual blight adversely affects the aesthetic quality of life and traffic safety in the community for residents, businesses, pedestrians, and persons in vehicles.
(c)
Protect the public health, safety and general welfare while protecting the rights of sign owners to expression and identification.
(d)
Provide regulations that vary the sign area based on the zoning district.
(e)
Provide regulations that are content neutral. It is not the intent to regulate the content of messages in any way. To accomplish this, these regulations do not distinguish between on-site or off-site sign content, nor do they distinguish between commercial and non-commercial content. Any sign permitted pursuant to this Article may contain commercial or non-commercial content. Sign allowances in this Article take into account the needs for off-premise signs and signs carrying messages of a non-commercial character.
(f)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs.
(g)
Insure that signs are compatible with adjacent land uses and with the total visual environment of the community.
(h)
Eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays.
(i)
Preserve and improve the appearance of the community as a place in which to live and to work and as an attraction to nonresidents who come to visit or trade.

Sec. 24.2. - Authority and Scope.
Findings Regarding Changeable Multiple Message Signs, Electronic. Changeable electronic multi message signs, which allow operators to change content from remote locations in a matter of seconds, have been shown to create possible threats to public safety. Such signs are erected for the purpose of trying to hold the attention of motorists by changing messages and pictures for short durations using a series of bright, colorful images produced mainly via LED (light emitting diode) technologies. Brightly lit signs that change messages every few seconds compel motorists to notice them, and they lure the attention of motorists away from what is happening on the road and onto the sign. Such signs pose public safety threats because if they attract a motorist's attention, the motorist will look at the sign and not at the road. Changeable electronic multiple message signs are also a threat to public safety because of their brightness, making them visible from great distances. Due to their nature of brightness and changing displays, changeable electronic multiple message signs are more distracting than signs which do not vary the message. Some such signs could, if unregulated, have the appearance of large, plasma-screen televisions. An electronic LED display contains brightly-lit text and graphics which can be seen from hundreds of feet away, drawing the attention of everyone within view. Unless otherwise regulated, such displays can be extremely bright since they are designed to be visible in bright sunlight and at night. Furthermore, the human eye is drawn to them far more strongly than to traditional illuminated signs. Such electronic LED displays can be seen from as far away as six-tenths of a mile, making them a distraction.. It takes a minimum of six seconds to comprehend the message on an electronic sign, which is three times the safe period for driver distraction. For these reasons, it is the intent of the City Council to allow changeable electronic multiple message signs subject to acceptable criteria. The City Council relies on the following studies and findings, among others, as empirical and professional justification for imposing these regulations:

A Wisconsin Department of Transportation study examined crash rates on I-94 East and West adjacent to the Milwaukee County stadium, after a variable message sign that showed sports scores and ads had been installed and concluded that "it is obvious that the variable message sign has had an effect on traffic, most notably in the increase of the side swipe crash rate." An analysis of the 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study, conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, released in 2006, showed that taking one's eyes off the road for more than two seconds for any reason not directly related to driving (such as checking the rearview mirror) "significantly increased individual nearcrash/crash risk." A 1998 FHWA memo noted that digital signs raise "significant highway safety questions because of the potential to be extremely bright, rapidly changing, and distracting to motorists." A 2001 FHWA review of billboard safety studies found that "the safety consequences of distraction from the driving task can be profound."

This Article is adopted to serve substantial governmental interests of correcting and avoiding multiple problems that would occur without the regulation of signs. The regulations contained herein are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests identified in this Article. It is not the intent of this Article to regulate the content of signs, but only their composition, type, location, distance from right-of-way, height, size, illumination, and in some cases the duration they may be displayed, or other non-content-based restrictions implied in this Article. It is not the intent of this Article to foreclose important and distinct mediums of expression for political, religious, or personal messages, on any sign permitted to be erected by this Article. These regulations shall not be construed as limiting the message content of any sign.

Sec. 24.17. - Removal of Certain Signs.
(a)
Unlawful signs. If any sign is installed, erected, or constructed in violation of this Article, the owner or person or firm maintaining the sign shall, upon notice either written or verbal notification from the City shall remove prohibited signs immediately. If the sign will require additional time to remove, because of its structure or size, then a reasonable time frame will be given by the City in which the signage is to be removed. Any such sign not removed or properly altered within the time period allotted from the notice, may then be removed by the City and all costs charged to the owner, agent, or person having beneficial interest of the building or premises upon which such sign was located, or in the sign itself.
(b)
Derelict signs. Should any sign become insecure or in danger of falling or otherwise unsafe in the opinion of the City, the owner or person or firm maintaining the sign shall, upon written notice from said enforcement officer, forthwith in the case of immediate danger and in any case within ten (10) days, remove such sign or secure it in a manner approved by the City.

Sec. 24.32. - Changeable Electronic Multiple Message Signs.
(a)
Definition. For purposes of this Section, "electronic multiple message sign" shall mean any sign, as defined in Sec. 24.2 of this Article other than a public variable message sign, which is erected by a city, county, or state government for traffic communications purposes which results in the illuminated display of messages or information by the use of a matrix of electric lamps (e.g., digital, LED (light emitting diode) or similar or refined display technology), movable discs, movable panels, light apertures, or other methods, which allows the message change to be actuated by a control mechanism rather than manually changing the message; and which changes the message more often than twice daily. It is characteristic of such signs that the sequence of messages and the rate of change can be electronically programmed and can be modified by electronic processes.
(b)
Purposes. This Section establishes requirements associated with the changeable electronic multiple message signs, including but not limited to the duration of message, transition time, light intensity, malfunction, and permitting, to ensure reasonable and safe standards are met to protect the motoring public.
(c)
Zoning Districts Permitted. Such signs shall only be permitted in HB (Highway Business), M-1 (Light Manufacturing and Industrial), and M-2 (Heavy) Manufacturing and Industrial) zoning districts.
(d)
Area and Height. No such sign shall exceed the area or height specified for the type of sign for which it is defined and permitted under the terms of this Article.
(e)
Separation. For Highway Signs and any other sign regulated by the Georgia Department of Transportation, no such sign shall be located within 5,000 feet of another changeable electronic multiple message sign on the same side of the highway and no such sign shall be within a 2,600 foot radius of another changeable electronic multiple message sign. For all other signs, no such sign shall be located within a 1,000 foot radius of another changeable electronic multiple message sign.
(f)
Nature of the Display. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to permit or authorize the flashing or variation of light intensity of an individual message; such flashing or variation constitutes an "animated sign" as defined in Sec. 24.2 and prohibited by Sec. 24.8 of this Article.
(g)
Duration of Message. Each multiple message shall remain fixed for at least 10 seconds.
(h)
Transition Time. When a message is changed, it shall be accomplished in less than one-tenth (1/10) of a second and shall not use fading, swiping, or other animated transition methods.
(i)
Illumination and Brightness. No electronic multiple message signs may be of such intensity or brilliance as to impair the vision of a motor vehicle driver with average eyesight or to otherwise interfere with the driver's operation of a motor vehicle. No sign may be of such intensity or brilliance that it interferes with the effectiveness of an official traffic sign, device or signal. The maximum illumination, intensity, or brightness of electronic signs shall not exceed 5,000 nits (candelas per square meter) during daylight hours, or 500 nits (candelas per square meter) between dusk to dawn. The sign must have an automatic phased proportional dimmer control, photocell or other light sensing device, or a scheduled dimming timer, or another approved device, which produces a distinct illumination change that reduces nighttime brightness levels (compared to daytime brightness levels). The applicant shall provide written certification from the sign manufacturer that the light intensity has been factory pre-set or can be programmed not to exceed the levels specified in this subsection; end-user manipulation of pre-set levels or to exceed those specifications herein shall not be permitted. Unless another industry standard is accepted, the measurement for purposes of this paragraph shall be at any point ten (10) feet from the surface of the electronic multiple message sign.
(j)
Freeze of Display When Malfunction Occurs. Such signs shall include a default designed to freeze a display in one still position if a malfunction occurs.
(k)
Sequencing of Messages Prohibited. Using two or more successive screens to convey a message that will fit on one (1) screen shall be prohibited.
(l)
Permit Requirements. In addition to those permit requirements established in Section 24.12 of this Article relative to permits for signs generally, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to impose additional permit requirements specific to changeable electronic multiple message signs and applications therefor, including but not limited to the following:
1.
Description or graphic depiction of the type of internal illumination technology; and
2.
A drawing or schematic prepared by an illumination engineer showing the amount of light designed to emanate from the proposed sign at the highway or public road to which the sign is directed, and at any highway or public road to which the proposed sign is visible. Said drawing or schematic shall show either is of foot-candles, (i.e., connecting points of equal light illumination levels, similar to a topographic contour), nits or a photometric grid with individual spot readings; and
3.
A statement certified by an engineer, acceptable to the Building Inspector, demonstrating that the weight of the sign upon installation has sufficient footing and other characteristics sufficient to ensure the sign will be safely secured and able to withstand wind resistance as may be customary for similar structures according to the applicable Building Code; and
4.
Other information as may be reasonably required by the Zoning Administrator to ensure compliance with the purpose and regulations of this Section, Article 24 of this Zoning Ordinance, and the purposes and intentions of this Zoning Ordinance generally.
These permit requirements shall be submitted on application forms prepared by the Zoning Administrator. These permit requirements are applicable to both the construction of a new changeable electronic multiple message sign and the re-facing of an existing sign with a changeable electronic multiple message sign.
