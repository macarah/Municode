It is the express intent of this regulation that if a package sales store is operated adjacent to an establishment which sells beer or wine for consumption on the premises as provided in section 1. of this regulation, with an inside connecting service door, such package sales store shall remain a distinct and separate business entity, and the package sales store is hereby declared to be a separate premise from the establishment which sells beer or wine for consumption on the premises.
3.
An establishment pouring licensed to sell beer or wine for consumption on the premises in accordance with section 1. of this regulation may sell items commonly associated with such establishments including potato chips, prepared food, snacks, soft drinks, cigarettes, cigars, lighters and accessories, and similar items but shall not sell items not commonly associated with such establishments.

(38)
Adult entertainment. Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, the city council notes the conditions and occurrences generally associated with adult entertainment establishments. It is the finding of the city council that adult entertainment establishments, particularly those where alcoholic beverages are served, result in an increase in criminal behavior and create undesirable community conditions. An increase in instances of disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, prostitution, drug trafficking and loitering of individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other counties and municipalities that permit adult entertainment establishments, particularly those in which alcoholic beverages are served. The city council also find that the increase in criminal behavior which accompanies adult entertainment establishments causes undesirable community conditions. Conditions experienced in other counties and municipalities are depression of property values in neighborhoods surrounding the adult entertainment establishment, community blight, an increased burden on and expenditure for law enforcement and an increase in the criminal case load in the judicial system due to a greater number of arrests because of the above mentioned crime problems.
In addition to the prohibitions under state law at O.C.G.A. § 3-3-41, no alcoholic beverages may be sold in any restaurant which features performances by topless dancers, go-go dancers, strippers or similar entertainers whose performances involve erotic dancing including without limitation the simulation of sexual activities and/or erotic or lewd touching. No such adult entertainment may be located within 1,000 feet of any restaurant selling alcoholic beverages. For the purpose of this subsection, distance shall be by direct measurement between property lines, using the closest property lines of the parcels of land involved.
(39)
Prostitution. It shall be unlawful for any pouring licensee to knowingly allow any person to frequent the pouring licensee's premises for the purpose of soliciting prostitution.
(40)
"Brown bag" and "bring your own bottle" practices prohibited. It shall be unlawful for a person to bring alcoholic beverages into any restaurant or similar eating facility within the city limits or for any person to permit such.

Adult entertainment. Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, the city council notes the conditions and occurrences generally associated with adult entertainment establishments. It is the finding of the city council that adult entertainment establishments, particularly those where alcoholic beverages are served, result in an increase in criminal behavior and create undesirable community conditions. An increase in instances of disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, prostitution, drug trafficking and loitering of individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other counties and municipalities that permit adult entertainment establishments, particularly those in which alcoholic beverages are served. The city council also find that the increase in criminal behavior which accompanies adult entertainment establishments causes undesirable community conditions. Conditions experienced in other counties and municipalities are depression of property values in neighborhoods surrounding the adult entertainment establishment, community blight, an increased burden on and expenditure for law enforcement, and an increase in the criminal case load in the judicial system due to a greater number of arrests because of the above mentioned crime problems.
In addition to the prohibitions under state law at O.C.G.A. § 3-3-41, no alcoholic beverages may be sold in any restaurant which features performances by topless dancers, go-go dancers, strippers or similar entertainers whose performances involve erotic dancing including without limitation the simulation of sexual activities and/or erotic or lewd touching. No such adult entertainment may be located within 1,000 feet of any restaurant selling alcoholic beverages. For the purpose of this subsection, distance shall be by direct measurement between property lines, using the closest property lines of the parcels of land involved.
