(l)
The Mayor and City Council may, in its discretion, consider any extenuating circumstances that may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, application or the proposed location of the business.

Sec. 4-65. - Types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited.
(a)
Preamble and purpose.
(1)
Based upon the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences the Mayor and City Council believe are relevant to the problems faced by the City and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, as well as the testimony of citizens and experts received by this commission, the Mayor and City Council takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country.
(2)
Moreover, it is the finding of the Mayor and City Council that public nudity and semi-nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "erotic entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or semi-nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or semi-nudity.
(b)

(1)

The phrase "places provided or set apart for nudity" means as follows: places provided or set apart for traditional family-oriented naturism including nudist parks, clubs, and resorts chartered by the American Association for Nude Recreation or affiliated with the Naturists Society or by traditional family-oriented naturists groups.
