Title 43, Ch. 15 (O.C.G.A. § 43-15-1 et seq.) and who is not an employee of or otherwise affiliated with or financially interested in such person, firm, or corporation, to provide the required inspection.
(b)
Any inspection conducted by a registered professional engineer shall be no less extensive than an inspection conducted by a County or municipal inspector.

The registered professional engineer shall be empowered to perform any inspection required by the Governing Authority of any county or municipality, including, but not limited to, inspections for footings, foundations, concrete slabs, framing, electrical, plumbing, heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), or any and all other inspections necessary or required for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the Mayor and Council of any county or municipality, provided that the inspection is within the scope of such engineer's branch of engineering expertise.
(e)
The registered professional engineer shall submit a copy of said engineer's inspection report to the County or municipality.
(f)
Upon submission by the registered professional engineer of a copy of said engineer's inspection report to the Mayor and Council, the Mayor and Council shall be required to accept the inspection of the registered professional engineer without the necessity of further inspection or approval by the inspectors or other personnel employed by the Mayor and Council unless the Mayor and Council has notified the registered professional engineer, within two business days after the submission of the inspection report, that it finds the report incomplete or the inspection inadequate and has provided the registered professional engineer with a written description of the deficiencies and specific code requirements that have not been adequately addressed.
(g)
The Mayor and Council may provide for the prequalification of registered professional engineers who may perform inspections pursuant to this section.
