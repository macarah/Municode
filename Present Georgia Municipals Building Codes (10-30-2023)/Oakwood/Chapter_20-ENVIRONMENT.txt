Chapter 20 - ENVIRONMENT
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 20-1—20-18. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - WATERSHED PROTECTION

Sec. 20-19. - District boundaries.
It is designated and established that the shaded area on exhibit A attached to the ordinance from which this article is derived and adopted by reference composes a watershed protection district. This area includes all lands north of the Hall/Gwinnett County line draining to Big Creek, Flowery Branch and Mud Creek in Hall County. Municipalities located within the district include the cities of Flowery Branch and Oakwood.
(Ord. No. 325, § 1.02, 2-14-2000)
Sec. 20-20. - Intent and scope.
Pursuant to Rule 391-3-6, Lake Sidney Lanier and its tributaries are exempt from the state department of community affairs and state department of natural resources large water supply watershed protection rules since the reservoir is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. To provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and the region, it is essential that the quality of public water supplies be ensured. The ability of natural systems to attenuate the negative effects of stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the aquatic integrity and storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces can introduce toxicants, nutrients and sedimentation into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable.
(Ord. No. 325, § 1.03, 2-14-2000)
Sec. 20-21. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to provide for the protection of the Big Creek, Flowery Branch and Mud Creek watersheds in the county. This protection is necessary for the enhancement of public health, safety and welfare as well as to ensure that surface waters are of high quality to meet state and federal standards.

Intermittent system means a stream that flows in a well-defined channel during wet seasons of the year but not for the entire year. They generally exhibit signs of water velocity sufficient to move soil material, litter and fine debris. They are usually identified as blue lines separated by three dots on United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps and as black lines separated by two or more dots on Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil maps. Large aquatic organisms such as some fish often are difficult to find or not present at all in these storms.
Issuing authority refers to the city council.
Land disturbing activity means a land change or construction activity for residential, commercial, silvicultural, industrial and institutional land use that can result in soil erosion from water or wind or movement of sediments or pollutants into state waters or onto lands of the state or in accelerated stormwater runoff. These activities include but are not limited to clearing, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land.

Reservoir boundary means the edge of a water supply reservoir defined by its normal pool level.
Riparian zones or riparian environments means the areas that border streams, rivers, lakes and wetlands. Riparian zones can be floodplains, streamside forests or just plain steam banks. They are usually different from surrounding lands because they have unique soil and vegetation characteristics and are strongly influenced by water. Riparian zones are basically the interface between the water and the land and they serve many functions which make them valuable to people.
Sediment means soils or other superficial materials transported and/or deposited by the action of wind, water or gravity as a product of erosion.
Sedimentation means the action or process of forming or depositing sediment.

(Ord. No. 325, § 1.05, 2-14-2000)
Sec. 20-23. - Sedimentation and erosion control.
Section IV of General Permit No. GAR10000, authorization to discharge under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction Activity, July 19, 1999, requires those persons conducting a construction activity of five acres on sites greater than five acres or part of a common development greater than five acres to prepare and implement an erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan (the plan) and a comprehensive monitoring program (the program). The plan will describe those best management practices (BMPs) which will be used at the site to control the discharge of sediment and other pollutants. BMPs will be designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all rainfall events up to and including a 25-year 24-hour rainfall event. The program will describe how the receiving waters will be monitored for turbidity. A summary report of monitoring and weekly inspections is required to be submitted to the state environmental protection division each month. The installation of these BMP devices may be subject to section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Persons conducting construction activities are also responsible for meeting water quality and wetland-related requirements found in sections 404 and 401 of the Clean Water Act. General Permit No. GAR10000 provides that a discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed and maintained shall constitute a separate violation for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 NTU for waters supporting warm-water fisheries. In addition to the specifications outlined in General Permit No. GAR10000, developments within the district will comply with the following items:
(1)
Sedimentation and erosion control fencing. Sedimentation and erosion practices will be required on all construction sites ranging from one-half to five acres in size. Requirements for larger sites are covered under the general permit discussed in this section. The following requirements are based on the Manual for Sediment and Erosion Control in Georgia:
a.
Type A silt fencing will be required on projects where the life of the project is greater than six months or the slope gradient is steeper than 2:1.
b.
Type B fencing will be required on projects where the life of the project is less than six months and if the slope gradient is less than 2:1.
c.
Type C fencing is required for all land disturbing activities with a fill slope exceeding a vertical height of 20 feet.
d.
Agricultural practices (silviculture, row crops and livestock operations) and small family gardens are exempt.
(2)
Biweekly erosion control inspection/certification by professional engineer.
a.
Erosion control measures at construction sites must be inspected and certified by a registered engineer or licensed surveyor on a biweekly basis to ensure that activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion, sedimentation and runoff. Additionally, the certified engineer shall identify other measures that need to be implemented to address deficiencies observed. The monitoring results must be reported to the appropriate governing entity within 48 hours of the biweekly inspection.
b.
If, through inspection, it is determined that a person has failed to comply with permit conditions or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served to that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time at which such measures will be completed. The city may issue a stop work order directing that all work on the site, except that work necessary to achieve compliance with this article, cease until compliance is achieved. While a stop work order is in effect, no inspection shall be conducted on the property by the building inspection department.
c.
The city shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may deem reasonably necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this article and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting.
d.
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent who requests entry for purposes of inspection and who presents appropriate credentials nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.

Sec. 20-25. - Stormwater management.
(a)
Stormwater runoff within the district must be managed to control the velocity at the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the streams. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures and devices shall be so planned, designed and constructed as to provide for a range of design flows for flood control. These design flows should be demonstrated for two-year through 100-year storm events using the procedures as outlined in the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release 55 Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds or other acceptable calculation procedures. All disturbed land must drain to an approved BMP and stormwater runoff must be managed for the entire drainage area above the detention system or BMP.
(b)
Temporary and permanent detention systems.
(1)
During construction. During construction, all land disturbing activities (to include all land uses) must comply with sedimentation and erosion control procedures/program as defined by General Permit (No. GAR10000). These activities must capture runoff from the first inch of rainfall to be released over not less than 48 hours. Dry ponds may be used.
(2)
After construction. After construction, all land disturbing activities must maintain runoff from the first one inch of rainfall and maintain peak flows for a 25-year storm at the property boundaries equal to or less than the flow under undeveloped conditions.
(3)
Permitting process. All land disturbing activities must demonstrate compliance with the stormwater control plan to the city prior to approval of any building or subdivision permit request. After development runoff from the first one inch of rainfall must be captured and retained for not less than 48 hours before discharging to waters of the state. Alternative practices which meet this intent are acceptable if they are approved by the city.
(Ord. No. 325, § 2.03, 2-14-2000)

ARTICLE III. - WETLANDS PROTECTION

Sec. 20-58. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service national wetlands inventory maps for the city.
Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1344), as amended.
Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.
(Ord. No. 346, art. II, 1-29-2001)
Sec. 20-59. - Purpose.
(a)
The wetlands in the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state.
(b)
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
(c)
The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.

(b)
The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitted requirements.
(Ord. No. 346, art. III, 1-29-2001)
Sec. 20-61. - Requirement for local permit.
No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the city zoning administrator using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.

(a)
Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 50 feet measured horizontally on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. This buffer shall not be altered or reduced by any method set forth hereinafter.
(2)
An additional setback shall be maintained beyond the natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Stormwater management structures shall be allowed within this setback; however, all other grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized. The setback shall be either of the following dimensions:
a.
For a uniform distance of 25 feet, measured horizontally, from the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer boundary.
b.
For a variable distance, measured horizontally, from the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer boundary, provided that the total area encompassed by this impervious setback on the land development activity is equal to, or greater than, the total area that would be encompassed by the uniform distance of 25 feet.
(3)
On properties between ten acres and 49.9 acres, the impervious setback area may be reduced such that the sum of the undisturbed buffer area and the impervious setback area do not exceed 12 percent of the total property area of the development activity. However, in no case shall the 50-foot undisturbed buffer be reduced or altered to achieve this percentage.
(4)
On properties of 50 acres or larger, the impervious setback area may be reduced such that the sum of the undisturbed buffer area and the impervious setback area do not exceed eight percent of the total property area of the development activity. However, in no case shall the 50-foot undisturbed buffer be reduced or altered to achieve this percentage.
(5)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback except that existing septic systems constructed prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived may be maintained or replaced but not enlarged within the required buffer and setback area.
(b)
Variance procedures. Variances from the buffer and setback requirements in subsection (a) of this section may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article and the city finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the city may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
(2)
Except as provided in subsection (b)(1) of this section, the city shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the city council. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
(c)
Conditions for variances. Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
(1)
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
(2)
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship.
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
(d)
Variance request contents. At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
(1)
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features as determined by field survey;
(2)
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;

The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
(4)
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
(5)
At least one alternative plan which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
(6)
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
(7)
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and
(8)
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
(e)
Consideration factors. The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
(1)
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
(2)
The locations of all streams on the property including along property boundaries;

Streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout reproduction but are capable of supporting trout throughout the year. First order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs.
Vegetative erosion and sedimentation control measures means measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by covering the soil with:
(1)
Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing long-term vegetative cover;
(2)
Temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or
(3)
Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass.
Such measures can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia.
Watercourse means any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater.
Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.

DIVISION 2. - MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR EROSION, SEDIMENTATION AND POLLUTION CONTROL USING BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

Sec. 20-170. - General provisions.
Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of sections 20-171 and 20-172. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with the requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(Ord. No. 2010-CO-05-660, § 1, 6-14-2010)
Sec. 20-171. - Minimum requirements/BMP's.
(a)
Best management practices as set forth in this section and section 20-172 shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(b)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a LIA or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(c)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a LIA or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f)), for each day on which such failure occurs.
(d)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
(e)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in section 20-172(15). [See section 20-108.]
(Ord. No. 2010-CO-05-660, § 1, 6-14-2010)
Sec. 20-172. - Local regulations to be comparable with state regulations.
The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosion elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 20-171;
(15)
Except as provided in subsection (16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events, that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round, for which ground water is not a source of water and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.) shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.

Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 20-192. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in a manner that the provisions of sections 20-171 and 20-172 will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10.
(c)
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(d)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the LIA shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the LIA. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 20-172(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid and bonding, if required as per subsection (f) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the LIA and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the LIA to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The LIA with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the LIA with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
(e)
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the LIA may deny the permit application.
