(5)
The location and intensity of outdoor lighting is such that it does not cast light on adjacent, adjoining or neighboring properties.
(6)
Hours and manner of operation of the proposed use are not inconsistent with adjacent and nearby uses.
(7)

(Ord. No. 212, § 8, 6-14-1993)
Sec. 54-29. - Criteria to consider for variances.
(a)
The city council is hereby empowered to authorize upon application in specific cases such variance from the dimensional requirements of zoning regulations (any provisions requiring a number to be achieved, such as height in feet, setback, lot area, lot width, parking and loading requirements, etc.) as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings or structures in the same zoning district or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance. A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship, after appropriate application in accordance with section 54-25, upon specific findings that all of the following conditions exist. The absence of any one of the conditions shall be grounds for denial of the application for variance.
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same district;
(2)
A literal interpretation of the provisions of these zoning regulations would create an unnecessary hardship and would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners within the district in which the property is located;
(3)
Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located;
(4)
Relief, if granted, will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or general welfare in such a manner as will interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonable affect their value;
(5)
The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant;
(6)
The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building, or structure; and
(7)
The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, building or structures which are not permitted by right in the district involved.
(b)
A variance shall not be granted in cases where the requested relief to the property owner can be remedied by a change to a zoning district which otherwise would not require a variance.
(Ord. No. 212, § 9, 6-14-1993)
Sec. 54-30. - Procedures for appeals.
(a)
The city council is empowered to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the zoning administrator in the interpretation or enforcement of these zoning regulations.
(b)
The city council is empowered to hear an appeal made by any person, firm, or corporation, or by any officer, department, board, or bureau affected by any decisions of the planning commission or zoning administrator based on this chapter.
(c)
This section shall not be construed as permitting an appeal of the city council's denial of a rezoning request or conditional use, the appropriate remedy of which would be suit in county superior court.
(d)
The appeal shall be taken within 30 days, or as provided by the rules of the city council, by filing with the zoning administrator notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. All papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken shall forthwith be transmitted to the city council.
(e)
The city council shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the appeal and give at least 15 days of public notice thereof and due notice to the parties in interest and shall render a decision on the appeal within a reasonable time.
(Ord. No. 212, § 10, 6-14-1993)
Sec. 54-31. - Conditional approval permitted.
In exercising the powers to grant variances, zoning map amendments and conditional use approvals, the zoning administrator and planning commission may recommend, and the city council may attach any conditions to its approval which it finds necessary to render the proposed zoning district, conditional use or variance compatible with adjacent and nearby properties and land uses. Applications to alter or modify any such conditions shall be considered only after compliance with procedures and notice requirements as established in this chapter, for the particular type of application.
(Ord. No. 212, § 11, 6-14-1993)
Sec. 54-32. - Public notice and public hearing required.
(a)
This section shall apply only to adoption of a new zoning ordinance, applications for amendments to the text of the zoning regulations, and amendments to the official zoning map. Public notice and public hearing shall not be required for applications for variances and conditional use permits.
(b)
Upon receipt of a completed application, fees and other information required by this chapter, the zoning administrator shall cause notice of such application to be published at least one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the community at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the public hearing before the city council. Said published notice shall include, as a minimum, the purpose, location, date and time of the public hearing before the city council, the location of the property being considered, the present zoning classification of the property, and the proposed zoning district. The zoning administrator shall also cause to have posted in a conspicuous place on said property one or more signs, each of which shall contain the information specified for published notices. The public hearing before the city council shall not take place until said signs have been posted for a least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the public hearing before the city council. Posting of signs shall not be required for appeals, since an appeal only applies to interpretation of zoning regulations which apply to all similarly situated properties.
(c)
The planning commission shall not be required to hold a public hearing on any matter, although at its discretion it may hold a public hearing during the regular meeting at which said application is to be considered.
(d)
Public hearings may be delayed, rescheduled or continued at another time and date, provided announcement is given at the time and place of the initially scheduled and advertised public hearing, and provided such date, time and location of the public hearing to be delayed, rescheduled or continued is announced. In cases where the planning commission has exercised its option to table an application, the advertised public hearing before the city council shall nevertheless be held at the time and date the hearing was advertised.
(Ord. No. 212, § 12, 6-14-1993)
Sec. 54-33. - Written notice to adjoining property owners.
(a)
Upon receiving notice from the zoning administrator or designee of completed applications for amendment to the official zoning map, the applicant shall provide written notice of the application, including all information for published notices specified in Section 54-32, by certified mail at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of public hearing before the city council, to all property owners with land adjoining the subject property, including those across public rights-of-way. Said written notices shall be mailed to the address of the current property owner of adjoining land as indicated on the current tax rolls of the city and county. Said adjacent addresses of property owners shall be derived from a list generated by the city staff and provided to the applicant. Copies of said written notice and postage receipts in the official zoning application file shall be considered sufficient evidence that the applicant has satisfied this notification when copies of the notices and postage receipts are submitted to the city ten days prior public hearing. The failure to receive the written notice by a property owner shall not be considered a violation of due process notification requirements.
(b)
The zoning administrator may require the applicant, at his discretion, to provide written notices in accordance with subsection (a) above, to property owners adjoining property which is the subject of a variance application or conditional use, where in the zoning administrator's opinion adjoining property owners may be affected by the variance or conditional use requested. The written notices shall be by certified mail at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of hearing before the city council, to all property owners with land adjoining the subject property, including those across public rights-of-ways. Written notices to adjoining property owners in variance or conditional use applications shall not be considered a mandated due process requirement.

(b)
After completing its studies of the particular petition, the planning commission shall submit a recommended action in writing to the city council. The recommended action shall be in the form of "Recommend approval as submitted," "Recommend approval with conditions" or "Recommend denial of the application request." In no case shall the planning commission defer or table a completed application request duly placed on the agenda. If any application request does not receive a majority vote after three motions, the application will be automatically forwarded to the council with a "No Recommendation" from the planning commission. In the event the planning commission does not have a quorum of members in attendance at its regularly scheduled meeting, all items on the agenda will automatically be forwarded to the city council with a "No Recommendation" from the planning commission.
