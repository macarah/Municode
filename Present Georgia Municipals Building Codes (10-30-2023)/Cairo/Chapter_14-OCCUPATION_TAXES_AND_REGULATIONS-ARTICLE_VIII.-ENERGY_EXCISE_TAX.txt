This article is adopted to address the interest of public finance.

In order for the municipality to properly impose such excise tax, the municipality must follow all of the provisions of Article 6 of Chapter 13 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, one provision of which is the enactment of this article.
