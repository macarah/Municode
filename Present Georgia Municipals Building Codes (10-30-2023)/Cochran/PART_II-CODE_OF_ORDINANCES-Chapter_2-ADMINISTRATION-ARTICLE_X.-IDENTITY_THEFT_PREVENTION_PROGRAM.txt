Sec. 2-496. - Purpose; alternate designation article.
(a)
The purpose of this article is to comply with 16 CFR 681.2 in order to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft by identifying and detecting identity theft red flags and by responding to such red flags in a manner that will prevent identity theft. Pursuant to 16 CFR 681.1, the purpose of this article is also to establish a process by which the city will be able to form a reasonable belief that a consumer report relates to the consumer about whom it has requested a consumer credit report when the city has received a notice of address discrepancy.
(b)
This article may be referred to as the city's identity theft prevention program or ITPP.
(Code 2011, § 2-503)

Sec. 2-498. - Findings.

The processes of opening a new covered account, restoring an existing covered account, making payments on such accounts, and making payments for property taxes and other services have been identified as potential processes in which identity theft could occur.
(3)
The city limits access to personal identifying information to those employees responsible for or otherwise involved in opening or restoring covered accounts or accepting payment for the use of covered accounts.

b.
Use of a previous customer's personal identifying information by another person in an effort to have service restored in the previous customer's name;
c.
Use of another person's credit card, bank account, or other method of payment by a customer to pay such customer's covered account; and

The applicant shall also provide any other information necessary for the department providing the service for which the covered account is created. The information shall be entered directly into the city's records system and held in a secure storage area with access limited to those city personnel with the need to know.
(b)
For each customer account for which the city may now or hereafter provide individual customer access to the customer's account information, such account shall be assigned an account number and personal identification number (PIN) which shall be unique to that account.
