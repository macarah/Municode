(2)
The purchasing agent, if appropriate, may require that bid deposits be submitted with each bid. If bid deposits are required, they shall be in an amount equal to five percent of the amount of the bid and may be submitted in the form of a bid bond signed by a surety company authorized to do business in the state, cashier's check, certified check issued by a bank or trust company insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), or any other form of bid security deemed sufficient by the city attorney or his designee.

(5)
The purchasing agent may require the successful bidder to furnish a payment and/or performance bond to secure the faithful performance of all of the terms of the contract.

Sec. 2-442. - Competitive sealed proposals.
(a)
When use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered by use of the competitive sealed proposal. The purchasing agent shall supervise this process. Use of the proposal is dependent upon such factors as:
(1)
When the quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or services;
(2)
When the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the city's best interest;
(3)
If a fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous; or
(4)
Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternative proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award.

Proposals shall be sealed. All proposals shall be received in public and the purchasing agent shall make or oversee the making of a record of the proposals received.

(3)
Award of contract shall be made to the proposer that submits the proposal deemed in the best interest of the city considering the evaluation factors outlined in the proposal documents.

This team shall include the purchasing agent, the head of the user department and an additional representative of the user department selected by the respective department head.
(4)
The purchasing agent may require the successful proposer to furnish a performance bond to secure the faithful performance of all of the terms of the contract. The performance bond shall be in a form approved by the city attorney and the form of the bond shall be included in the specifications. The city council may reject the bond of any proposer if they find it to be unacceptable.
(5)
All contracts greater than $6,001.00 to which this section applies shall be in writing and shall be approved by the city council. The city council may reject any and all proposals.
(Ord. of 4-10-2018(2), § 2.456)
Sec. 2-443. - Multi-step competitive sealed procurement.
(a)
The multi-step competitive sealed procurement method may be used when the city desires to award a contract not necessarily based on price, and when specifications may not be readily available or when technical qualifications are essential for the decision-making process. The purchasing agent shall supervise this process. This type of procurement shall take the form of request for proposal (RFP) or request for information (RFI) and shall follow the following format. If time is of the essence, the two steps can be combined with the priced offer submitted in a separate sealed envelope at the time of submission of the technical offer. The pricing data is to remain unopened until evaluation of technical offers is complete.
(b)
The solicitation shall be advertised in a newspaper having general circulation in the city. The advertisement shall state the time and place where documents may be obtained and the time and place for deadline for receipt of documents. At least 14 full days must pass between the day the advertisement appears and the day of the deadline for receipt of documents. The advertisement shall state that the city reserves the right to reject any or all documents received.
(c)
The initial step shall consist of solicitation of technical offers with no costs or prices included. Unweighted evaluation criteria shall be included in the solicitation documents. A team consisting of no less than three persons shall evaluate the results of this solicitation. This team shall include the purchasing agent, the head of the user department and an additional representative of the user department selected by the respective department head. Evaluation shall follow the same criteria as under request for proposals.
(d)
In the second step, those who submitted technical offers deemed responsible and responsive in the initial step are then asked to submit price bids.
(e)
Bids shall be sealed. All bids shall be publicly opened and the purchasing agent shall make or oversee the making of a record of the bids received. The record and the bids received shall be subject to public inspection after the bid opening in the manner prescribed by law.
(f)
Award of bid shall be made to the bidder that submits the lowest responsible and responsive bid that meets the specifications contained in the bid documents and is in the best interest of the city. The city reserves the right to make award if a single bid is received.
(g)
The purchasing agent may require the successful bidder to furnish a payment and/or performance bond to secure the faithful performance of all of the terms of the contract. The payment and/or performance bond shall be in a form approved by the city attorney and the form of the bond shall be included in the specifications.
(h)
