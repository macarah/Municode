Sec. 66-391. - Purpose and policy.
(a)
Compliance with state and federal water pollution control laws. This article sets forth uniform requirements for persons who cause wastewater to be discharged into the wastewater collection and treatment system of the county and enables the county to comply with all applicable state and federal laws required by the Clean Water Act, as amended, and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403). The federally mandated objectives of this article are:
(1)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the county wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge;
(2)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the county wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
(3)
To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludges from the system; and
(4)
To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the county wastewater system.
This article provides for the regulation of persons who cause wastewater to be discharged into the county wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement activities, requires user reporting, assumes that existing customers' capacity will not be preempted, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems.
(b)
Applicability. This article shall apply to the residents of the county and to all users of the county water and wastewater systems including persons outside the county who are, by contract or agreement with the county, users of the county water and wastewater systems. Except as otherwise provided herein, the director of water and wastewater, also known as the utility director, and hereafter referred to as the director, or his designee shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of the ordinance.
(c)
Allocation. No allocation of sewer capacity shall be made that results in more than 50 percent of the capacity at all sewer treatment facilities being allocated to residential use.

All existing users shall complete such a plan within 90 days after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. Construction shall be completed within 180 days of approval of plans by the county. No significant industrial user who commences contribution to the county wastewater system after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures and facilities (if required) have been approved by the county. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article.
(b)
Notification required. Notification of accidental discharge shall be in accordance with section 66-427(f).
(c)
Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two years, the director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the director may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
(1)
Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges;
(2)
Description of stored chemicals;
(3)
Procedures for immediately notifying the director of any accidental or slug discharge; as required by section 66-427; and
(4)
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.

Sec. 66-433. - Hauled wastewater.
(a)
Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the director, and at such times as are established by the director. Such waste shall not violate any section of this article or any other requirements established by the county. The director may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits.
(b)
The director shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this article.
(c)
Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the director. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the director, the director may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The director may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
(d)
Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 23)
Sec. 66-434. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
(a)
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(b)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section.
(c)
(1)
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(2)
A user shall submit oral notice to the pretreatment coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(d)
A bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(1)
The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe, property damage;
(2)
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(3)
The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section.
(e)
The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d) of this section.
(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 24)
Sec. 66-435. - County's right of revision.
The county reserves the right to establish, by future amendment to this article or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW.
(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 25)
Sec. 66-436. - Dilution.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate
(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 26)
Sec. 66-437. - Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the county's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as "trade secrets" under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. To the extent allowed by law, when requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.
(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 27)
Sec. 66-438. - Miscellaneous provisions.

(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 28)
Sec. 66-439. - High strength wastewater surcharge.
(a)
Establishment of. Users discharging "high strength" wastewater into the county wastewater system may be assessed a monetary surcharge, in addition to the normally required sewer use charges, in an amount to be calculated as shown below. A "high strength" wastewater is defined as wastewater which contains the below shown parameters in excess of the below shown monthly average concentrations:
(1)
Five day, 20° C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ) of 300 milligrams per liter (mg/l), not to exceed a maximum of 500 mg/l.
(2)
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 500 milligrams per liter (mg/l), not to exceed a maximum of 1,000 mg/l
(3)
Total ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 +NH 4 ) of 30 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 45 mg/l.
(4)
Total inorganic phosphates of 12 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum 16 mg/l.
(5)
Floatable oil and grease of 100 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 150 mg/l.
The above parameters shall be determined by the utilization of the sampling and testing procedures as provided in section 66-424. The amount of the surcharge, which may be charged and assessed against all users discharging high strength wastewater into the county wastewater system, shall reflect the cost incurred by the county in handling the excess oxygen demand, ammonia, total inorganic phosphates, and floatable oil and grease. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of charges for maintenance and operation of the wastewater treatment facilities including depreciation and other incidental expenses.
(b)
Formula. When the concentrations of the surcharged parameters shown above exceed the values of the constituents as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the excess concentrations may be subject to a surcharge in the amount derived in accordance with the following formula:
Surcharge $/month P × G × 8.34 × C
Where:
"P" is the excess monthly average concentration in mg/l of the parameter (BOD 5 , etc.) being evaluated; i.e., the actual concentration less the allowable concentration listed in subsection (a) of this section would be the excess. The maximum concentration shown in subsection (a) of this section shall not be exceeded.
"G" is equal to the user's total monthly wastewater flow in millions of gallons.
"8.34" pounds per gallon conversion factor.
"C" is equal to the unit cost in dollars per pound ($/lb) for the treatment of the surcharged parameters. This value shall be established by the director based on actual wastewater treatment costs which shall be revised from time to time as necessary.
(c)
Quantitative measurement of surchargeable parameters. The measurement of the surcharge parameters (BOD 5 , COD, ammonia, total inorganic phosphates, or floatable oil and grease) shall be conducted as follows:
(1)
Monitoring to determine surcharge shall be conducted by the industrial user as specified in the user's permit except that frequency of testing for surchargeable parameters shall be a minimum of two tests per month. If the permit requires more frequent testing, then the average of all test results will be used to calculate the surcharge. If the permit requires less frequent testing for compliance purposes, then testing frequency will be increased to twice per month.
(2)
The county may sample the user as often as desired at the county's expense. The county will split the sample with the industrial user at the user's request.
(d)
Billing procedure. Wastewater surcharges as provided for in this section will be included on the user's regular water and sewer bill or on a separate wastewater surcharge bill.

DIVISION 3. - ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES

Sec. 66-461. - Enforcement.
(a)
General. The failure of any person to comply with any provision contained in this article shall be a violation which shall be enforced in accordance with the penalties and provisions as hereinafter set forth.
(b)
Inspections. The director shall have the right to direct and conduct such investigations as he may reasonably deem necessary to carry out his duties as described in this article. For this purpose, the director and his authorized employees and representatives, upon presentation of proper credentials, shall have the right to enter at reasonable times on any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the conditions relating to pollution and to inspect the operating records of any sewage system, waste treatment work, or other sewage disposal method. Upon refusal of the right of entry, the director may apply to the municipal court for an administrative search warrant, upon showing probable cause that a violation exists.
(c)
Significant noncompliance. The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean:
(1)
Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
(2)
Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
(3)
Any other discharge violation that the director believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
(4)
Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the director's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5)
Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
(6)
Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;

Sec. 66-462. - Notice of violation.
When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or consent order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director shall serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without a notice of violation first being issued.
(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 42)
Sec. 66-463. - Consent orders.
The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified in the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as binding contracts under state law and shall be judicially enforceable by petition for specific performance.
(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 43)
Sec. 66-464. - Injunctive relief.
When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition the county superior court, through the county attorney, for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains the further violation and/or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, consent order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 44)
Sec. 66-465. - Termination of discharge.
(a)
Any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1)
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2)
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
(3)
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4)
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
(5)
Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 66-423.
(b)
Such user shall be notified, in writing, of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered a reasonable opportunity to show cause before the director why the proposed action should not be taken. The decision of the director, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall be deemed a final action by the county. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. Aggrieved users may seek judicial review by petitioning the superior court of the county for writ of certiorari.
(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 45)
Sec. 66-466. - Emergency suspensions.
(a)
The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after oral notice to the user, whenever, in the director's sole discretion, such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
(1)
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 66-465 are initiated against the user.
(2)
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of a termination hearing under section 66-465.
(b)
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 46)
Sec. 66-467. - Civil liability.
(a)
A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or consent order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the county for a maximum penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation, but shall not exceed $25,000.00 cumulatively. The director shall cause a citation to be issued to the violator to appear before the municipal court of the county to show cause why such penalty should not be imposed.
(b)
In addition to any monetary fine imposed, the director may seek restitution of reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the county.
(c)
In determining the amount of penalty to be imposed, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions voluntarily undertaken by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
(d)
In lieu of the provisions of subsections (a) through (c) of this section, the director may, in his sole discretion, elect to file a complaint for civil liability in the state court, in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 12-5-51. In those cases where the violator has been cited to municipal court and refuses to waive the right to trial by jury, the municipal court may bind the case over to the state court under this section.
(e)
Conviction in the municipal court under this section shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 47)
Sec. 66-468. - Criminal prosecution.
(a)
A user who willfully or knowingly violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or consent order issued hereunder, or any orders of the municipal court issued under section 66-467, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The director shall apply for a state warrant for violation of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-53(a), returnable to the state court.
(b)
The director shall seek the issuance of state warrants for any person violating any of the provisions set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-5-53(b) through (d), returnable to the appropriate state courts of criminal jurisdiction.
(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 48)
Sec. 66-469. - Remedies nonexclusive.
The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the county's enforcement response plan. However, the director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 49)
Sec. 66-470. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
