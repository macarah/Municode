The proceeds of such bond or letter of credit shall be available to reimburse the county for any cost incurred to repair such damages or remove such debris in or around the county's rights of way. The proceeds of such bond or letter of credit shall also be available to reimburse the county for any costs incurred to maintain or repair county roads damaged by the ingress or egress of motor vehicles engaged in the harvest operations located within 500 feet of any point of ingress or egress of the timber harvesting operation.

(h)
When damage results from a person or firm's harvesting activities, the board, through the public works department shall make and provide a written claim to the person or firm causing the damage within 30 business days after becoming aware of the damage.

(2)
In the event of inclement weather or other factors preventing repair of the damage, request a 30-day extension to repair the damage from the public works department, provided that no extensions shall exceed 90 days from the date the claim was tendered.

(3)
Appeal the claim to the magistrate court of Oconee County. Any such appeal must name the issuer of the bond or letter of credit as a party, who shall be served with all pleadings in the action and shall have the right to appear. The magistrate court will hear evidence and arguments within 30 days of the written appeal and issue a ruling within ten days of such hearing. Any such appeal shall toll the thirty-day period, or any extension thereof, required by subsection (h) of this section. If the magistrate court rules in favor of the person or firm against whom the claim was made, the county shall have no right to recover any proceeds of the bond or letter of credit, and judgment shall be entered against the county. If the magistrate court rules in favor of the county, the court shall determine the amount of damages to which the county is entitled to recover and enter judgment accordingly; the county shall be authorized to call the bond or letter of credit and recover from the proceeds thereof an amount equal to the judgment entered by the court, up to the total amount of the bond or letter of credit. The portion of any judgment entered in favor of the county that exceeds the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be subject to collection by any additional remedies at law or equity.
(4)
In the event the person or firm against whom the claim has been submitted fails to take any of the actions allowed under subsections (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection within the time required therein, such person or firm shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights to contest the call of the bond or letter of credit.

In addition, if the person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit caused its revocation, the amount of the bond or letter of credit required shall be increased to $7,500.00 after the first revocation, and $10,000.00 after a second revocation caused by the person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit. The maximum amount of the bond or letter of credit shall not exceed $10,000.00.
(l)
Submission of the notice required by this section shall authorize the person or firm submitting same to undertake the timber harvesting operation described in the notice and shall remain in effect until such time as the person or firm gives notice that the harvesting operation is complete; provided, however, that any change in the facts required to be provided for purposes of such notice, including but not limited to a change in the scope or extent of the operation, must be reported to the public works department within three business days after such change.
