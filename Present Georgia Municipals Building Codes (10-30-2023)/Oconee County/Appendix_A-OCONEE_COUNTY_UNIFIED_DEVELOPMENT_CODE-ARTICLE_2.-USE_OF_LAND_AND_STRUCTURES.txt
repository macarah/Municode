Sec. 206.01. - S-P Scenic Preservation Overlay District.
a.
Purpose and intent of the S-P overlay district. The S-P Scenic Preservation Overlay District is comprised of land which in the best interest of the citizens of Oconee County should remain in a natural state as nearly as possible. The intent of the regulations within this Overlay District is to maintain and upgrade the character of historic, natural, archaeological and scenic areas of interest within the County. Such regulations are designed to provide for the preservation of the designated areas without unreasonably denying the right of private land use.
b.
Uses allowed in the S-P overlay district. Within the S-P Scenic Preservation Overlay District, only the following uses are allowed, regardless of other uses otherwise allowed by right or Special Use approval in the underlying zoning district:
(1)
Natural, historic, archaeological, scenic areas; buildings and associated structures and digs which are necessary to the improvement, restoration, maintenance and scholarly study of such areas, so long as such buildings and associated structures and digs do not conflict with the intent of this Development Code to preserve the special character of these areas.

Pasture lands and forests.
(3)
Passive recreation areas.
(4)
Public parks maintained by the County or the State of Georgia or the United States Government.

a.
Purpose and intent of the F-P overlay district. The intent of the regulations within this Overlay District is to limit the use of such flood plain lands to:
(1)
Prevent flood damage to persons and properties and to minimize expenditures for flood relief programs, flood control projects and flood damage repairs.
(2)
Preserve drainage courses that will be adequate to carry storm water runoff from existing and future land developments.
(3)
Prohibit landfills or other obstructions to the flow of flood waters, except those included in the permitted uses listed below.
(4)
Permit uses that are appropriate on flood plains and utilize effectively this valuable county resource.
b.
Uses allowed in the F-P overlay district. Within the F-P Flood Prone Overlay District, only the following uses are allowed, regardless of other uses otherwise allowed by right or Special Use approval in the underlying zoning district:
(1)
Agriculture, including forestry and livestock raising, requiring no structures within the flood plain, except structures for temporary shelter, and including agricultural and forestry access roads.
(2)
Dams provided they are constructed in accordance with the specifications of the USDA Soil Conservation Service or the U.S. Corps of Engineers.
(3)
Fences.
(4)
Parking areas.
(5)
Roads, provided that adequate portions of them are constructed on bridges or piers to permit the free flow of flood waters.
(6)
Public, semi-public, private and commercial recreation uses requiring no structures within the flood plain except structures for temporary shelter.
(7)
Public utility poles, towers, pipelines and sewage treatment outfalls.

c.
Procedure for correcting an error in F-P Flood Prone overlay district boundary line.
(1)
If a property owner can demonstrate to the Oconee County Board of Commissioners that an error has been made in establishing the Flood Prone District boundary line and that his property or a designated portion of it that lies in the Flood Prone Zoning District is actually not subject to flooding, the Board of Commissioners may correct the Flood Prone District boundary line accordingly.
(2)
Such correction shall comply with applicable state and federal regulations, and shall be filed as a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) upon approval. See the Flood Damage Prevention Section of the Erosion Control and Stormwater Management Article of this Development Code.
Sec. 206.03. - 78/316 Special Overlay District.
a.
The purpose of the 78/316 Special District Overlay is to recognize that the area generally bounded by Ga. Highway 316, U.S. Highway 78 and Atlanta Highway lying within Athens-Clarke County, Oconee County, and the City of Bogart is uniquely suitable for industrial, manufacturing, commercial and office development at a high density, regional scale, to encourage and promote such regional scale development in a manner that is coordinated by and among those jurisdictions with a uniform procedure for review and approval of projects. This Special District Overlay Zone (the "District") will ensure that development and structures are consistent with the vision, recommendations and goals of the Future Land-use plans and Future Development Plans of Athens-Clarke County, Oconee County and the City of Bogart. Further, this district is established to promote and protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Athens-Clarke County, Oconee County and the City of Bogart, respectively.
b.
Boundaries and Applicability.
(1)
The 78/316 Special District Overlay boundaries shall be as designated on the Official Zoning Map of Oconee County, Georgia, as shown on Appendix C hereto. The Official Zoning Map of Oconee County, Georgia is hereby amended by adding the 78/316 Special District Overlay as a zoning district to the legend to said map, as shown on Appendix C hereto.
(2)
In any case where the provisions of the 78/316 Special District Overlay conflict with those of the underlying zoning district or with other provisions of the unified development code, the standards and requirements of the 78/316 overlay district shall govern.
(3)
The conditions for approval of any rezoning, variance, or conditional use approved by the governing jurisdiction under any prior ordinance shall remain in full force and effect and enforceable under the procedures of this Special District Overlay.
(4)
If aspects of a development are not expressly regulated by the standards associated with the 78/316 Special District Overlay, the development standards associated with the underlying zoning designation and all other applicable development regulations administered by the jurisdiction in which the development is located shall apply.
c.
Special District Overlay Amendment and Boundary Alteration Procedure - General Provisions.
(1)
Changing needs and a dynamic economy of a growing community may from time to time require periodic updates of this Special District Overlay ordinance to maintain consistency between the provisions of the article and various community plans. In order to fulfill the above-stated purposes, the governing authorities of Athens-Clarke County, Oconee County, and the City of Bogart commit not only to the enforcement of this zoning ordinance but to its ongoing maintenance and updating as typical planning and review processes may dictate.
(2)
Special District Overlay Amendment or Boundary Alteration - Generally.
(a)
Scope—Every application to amend the Special District Overlay shall address the impact of the proposed change on the following:
1.
The comprehensive plan for the jurisdiction that is receiving the application;
2.
The future development map for the jurisdiction that is receiving the application;
3.
The balance of land uses within the jurisdiction that is receiving the application;
4.
Public facility elements of such jurisdiction's comprehensive plan and service delivery plan, and how the proposed change will affect the provision of services anticipated in such plan.
(b)
Amendments shall be further evaluated under the following factors to balance the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of the property in issue:
1.
The existing land use pattern surrounding the property in issue;
2.
The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts;
3.
The population density pattern and possible increase or over-taxing of the load on public facilities including, but not limited to, schools, utilities, and streets;
4.
The cost to each of the governmental entities in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public utilities, schools, streets and other public safety measures;
5.
The possible impact on the environment, including but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality and water quantity;
6.
Whether the proposed zoning amendment will be a deterrent to the value or improvement of development of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations;
7.
Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing zoning; provided, however, evidence that the economic value of the property, as currently zoned, is less than its economic value if rezoned as requested will not alone constitute a significant detriment;
8.
The aesthetic effect of existing and future use of the property as it relates to the surrounding area.
(c)

Sec. 207. - Uses allowed in each zoning district.
This Section identifies the uses that are allowed by right or by Special Use approval in each of the zoning districts (Sec. 205), and uses to which certain restrictions apply.
a.
In specific areas covered by an overlay district, the overlay district imposes restrictions on uses not noted on the following use tables. The specifics of each overlay district under Sec. 206 must be consulted as applicable to a particular property or area.
b.
In Master Planned Developments (MPDs) and Planned Unit Developments (PUDs), uses that are allowed are established through approval of the planned development. See the Subdivisions and Planned Developments Article of this Development Code for details.
Sec. 207.02. - Chart of uses.
This section lists by the following matrix chart the uses allowed by right and by Special Use approval in each zoning district. A listed allowed use is one which is allowed in the zone without any qualifications, except wherever such qualifications may be indicated in this Development Code. A listed special use is one which may be granted only when certain conditions are met. In the following chart an "A" means that the use is automatically allowed in the zoning district listed by the abbreviation at the top of the column. An "S" means that the use is allowed only by special use approval. A blank space indicates that the use is not allowed under any circumstances.
Sec. 207.03. - Allowed principal and accessory uses.
a.
A Principal Use is the specific, primary purpose for which land or a building is used.
b.
An Accessory Use is a use that is permitted on a property in conjunction with a principal use. An accessory use is incidental to the principal use and would not exist independent of the principal use.
c.
Principal uses that are allowed by right or allowed only by Special Use approval in each zoning district are shown on the following Table 2.1: Principal Uses Allowed by Zoning District. Accessory uses that are allowed in conjunction with a principal use are shown on Table 2.2: Accessory Uses Allowed by Zoning District.
Sec. 207.04. - Special uses.
Principal and accessory uses that are Special Uses may be granted subject to Special Use approval procedures as set forth in the Procedures and Permits Article of this Code.
Sec. 207.05. - Restrictions on particular uses.
Restrictions that apply to certain principal uses and to certain zoning districts are listed in the Restrictions on Particular Uses Article of this Code (Article 3). The restrictions also apply to Special Uses unless specifically waived or modified as a stipulation of Special Use approval. For those uses that have specific restrictions associated with them, a reference is given on the two tables to the pertinent Section in Article 3. The provisions of Division 1 of Article 3 that apply to development in general, and Division IV, Prohibited Uses, however, are not indicated in either of the two tables. [3]
Footnotes:
--- (3) ---
The following Sections of Article 3 apply generally and may not be otherwise noted on Table 2.1 or Table 2.2 in all cases:  §302, Separation distances between certain use;  §303, Environmentally hazardous uses;  §304, Standards for single-family and two-family dwellings;  §305, Standards for multi-family dwellings (including townhouses) ;  §306, Standards for nonresidential uses;  §307, Sexually oriented adult uses; Division IV, Prohibited uses.

Sec. 207.06. - Prohibited uses.
a.
Any principal use not shown on the following Table 2.1 as allowed in a zoning district, whether by right or with approval as a Special Use, is specifically prohibited.
b.
Any accessory use not shown on the following Table 2.2 as allowed in a zoning district, whether by right or with approval as a Special Use, is specifically prohibited.
c.
In addition, uses, products and manufacturing processes that are specifically prohibited in all zoning districts are listed in Division IV of Article 3.
Sec. 207.07. - Interpretation of uses.
Some degree of interpretation will occasionally be required. It is not possible to list each and every variation or name of a given use.
a.
In addition to other generally accepted references and resources, the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (current available edition), may be referred to in order to interpret the definition of uses listed on Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 to identify similar uses that may be allowed along with each listed use. The NAICS classification number is shown on the tables for each applicable use for reference and interpretation only; the NAICS is not adopted as part of this Code.
In all cases of uncertainty, the determination of whether or not a particular use is allowed in a particular zoning district shall reflect the purpose of the zoning district as stated in this Article, both the common and dictionary definitions of the use, and the array of listed uses that are allowed in the district as to their character and intensity, as determined by the Planning Director.
