Chapter 16 - MEDIA PRODUCTIONS

Sec. 16-1. - Title.
The rules and regulations contained herein shall be known as the City of Manchester Media Productions Ordinance.
(Ord. of 5-11-2015)
Sec. 16-2. - Purpose.
It is the public policy of the State of Georgia to market the state as a location for media productions, recognizing the economic impact this industry provides, as well as the tourism it generates for local jurisdictions, such as. City of Manchester is further fortunate to have a diverse number of unique locations to attract movies and television productions to the city.
Despite the many positive benefits a media production may offer, certain inconveniences may result if the production company and city cannot work in concert to assure minimum standards are met and to assure a thoroughly planned production schedule is followed. These concerns are best addressed through a regulatory permit.
