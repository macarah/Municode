DIVISION 4. - MOTIONS

Sec. 2-117. - Main motion.
The city council may discuss any item on the agenda without the requirement of a motion being made. In order for the city council to take any official action on any subject, a councilmember must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chairperson until another councilmember agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the councilmember seconding the motion to support the motion. A councilmember may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the city council has voted on that motion.
(Code 2002, § 2-83; Ord. No. 2021-1216-01 , § 1, 12-16-2021)
Sec. 2-118. - Debate.
(a)
After the main motion is recognized by the chair, the city council shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the mayor in a manner that is fair to all members of the city council. Councilmembers may participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the mayor.
(b)
During the course of debate, councilmembers may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the city council take a particular action on a motion. There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a certain time. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated.
(c)
Councilmembers may also introduce privileged motions. Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions.
(Code 2002, § 2-84)
Sec. 2-119. - Procedure for voting on debatable and undebatable motions.
Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following:
(1)
Debatable motions. For debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways:
a.
If debate has been completed and no other councilmember wishes to speak, the chairperson can call for the vote. If there are no objections, the chairperson can proceed with the vote.
b.
If the mayor calls for the vote and there is an objection, a city councilmember may move to vote immediately (move the previous question). If this motion is seconded and approved by a two-thirds vote, debate will stop. The mayor will then read the proposed motion to the city council and ask for the votes of the councilmembers.
(2)
Undebatable motions. For undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chair. The mayor shall read the proposed motion to the city council and then call for the vote.
(Code 2002, § 2-85)
Sec. 2-120. - Ranking of motions.
(a)
Each subsidiary and privileged motion of the city council is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the city council returns to consider the motion of lower precedence.
(b)
A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this subsection. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list:
(1)
Main motion (lowest rank).
(2)
Subsidiary motions (debatable):
a.
Postpone indefinitely.
b.
Amend.
c.
Refer to committee (commit).
d.
Postpone to a certain time (postpone definitely).
(3)
Subsidiary motions (undebatable):
a.

c.
Lay on the table (postpone temporarily).
(4)
Privileged motions (undebatable):
a.
Question of privilege.
b.
Recess.
c.

(Code 2002, § 2-86)
Sec. 2-121. - Subsidiary motions.
(a)
Generally. During the course of debate, councilmembers may introduce motions that propose that the city council take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow the city council to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions: amend, limit debate and vote immediately, also may apply to other subsidiary motions.
(b)
Postpone indefinitely. If a councilmember believes that the main motion should not be considered by the city council, that councilmember may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops, and the main motion is tabled. A motion to postpone indefinitely may be debated, but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(c)
Amend. If a councilmember believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, the councilmember can move to amend the motion.
(1)
Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend.
(2)
Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a certain time and the motion to recess can also be amended.
(3)
A motion cannot be amended more than two times.
(4)
Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable.
(5)
A majority vote is required for the city council to adopt an amendment.
(6)
If the amendment is adopted, the city council shall consider the amended version of the motion.
(d)
Refer to a committee (commit). If a councilmember believes that further information is needed before the city council can act on a main motion, the councilmember may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the city council. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(e)
Postpone to certain time (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a councilmember believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the mayor will bring the original motion back to the city council for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(f)
Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the councilmember who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and a two-thirds vote is required.
(g)
Vote immediately (previous question). If a councilmember believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the councilmember may move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable, and a vote of two-thirds of the city council is required for the motion to pass.
(h)
Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the city council during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(Code 2002, § 2-87; Ord. No. 2021-1216-01 , § 1, 12-16-2021)
Sec. 2-122. - Privileged motions.
(a)
Generally. Privileged motions facilitate the running of the city council meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions.
(b)
Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chairperson concerning the rights of a councilmember or of the city council as a whole is referred to as a "question of privilege." It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chairperson is required to make a ruling on the question.
(c)
Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion, but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(d)
Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a councilmember must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(Code 2002, § 2-88)
Sec. 2-123. - Incidental motions.
(a)
Generally. Incidental motions allow councilmembers to exert their rights as a city councilmember. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting.
(b)
Appeal. If a councilmember disagrees with a decision that is made by the chair, that councilmember may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the councilmembers. The chairperson has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The councilmembers may then debate the appeal. The councilmembers shall decide by majority vote if the chair's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table.
(c)
Parliamentary inquiry. If a councilmember has a question about the rules of order, that councilmember may ask the chairperson to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the councilmember. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable.
(d)
Point of order (question of order). If a councilmember believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, that councilmember can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairperson can make a ruling on the question or can allow the councilmembers to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table.
(e)
Point of information (request for information). If a councilmember has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, that councilmember may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chairperson and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required, and the motion is not debatable or amendable.
(Code 2002, § 2-89; Ord. No. 2021-1216-01 , § 1, 12-16-2021)
Sec. 2-124. - Supplementary main motions.
(a)
Generally. Three motions allow the councilmembers to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the councilmembers. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified.
(b)
Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the councilmembers to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the councilmembers to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any councilmember may make a motion to reconsider, and any councilmember may second the motion. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the councilmembers is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided, and the councilmembers will return to debate and revote the original motion.
(c)
Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the councilmembers overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any councilmember. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the councilmember seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-86. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, the councilmembers shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided.
(d)
Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the councilmembers to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
