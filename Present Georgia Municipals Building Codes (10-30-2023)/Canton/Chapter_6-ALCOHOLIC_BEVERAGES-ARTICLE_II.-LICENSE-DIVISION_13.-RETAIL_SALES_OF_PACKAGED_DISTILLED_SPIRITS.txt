If the number resulting from the division required by subsection (a) of this section is a number other than a whole number (for example 1.75) then said number will be adjusted downward to the next whole number where it will remain until the population increases to such an extent which would cause said number to equal or exceed the next higher whole number. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of licenses permitted by this section shall never be less than one.
(c)
The language contained in subsections (a) and (b) of this section can be expressed in the mathematical formula, as follows: Y รท 8,000 = X.
