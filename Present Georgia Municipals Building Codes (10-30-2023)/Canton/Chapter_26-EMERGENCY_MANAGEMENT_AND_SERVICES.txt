Sec. 26-12. - Price overcharging prohibited.
(a)
The health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city depend upon the availability and affordability of certain essential commodities and reasonable access to shelter. During certain periods of emergency, resulting from natural or manmade disasters, the public is at risk from dramatic and unjustified increases in the prices of certain essential goods, materials, services and housing. Such increases in prices may be excessive and unconscionable during an emergency and may delay recovery. Legislation is necessary to prohibit any person from raising prices for goods, materials, services and housing to excessive, unconscionable or unfair levels during an emergency or subsequent recovery period. Limitations on price overcharging an emergency are authorized pursuant to the police powers of the city and O.C.G.A. § 38-3-28, as amended.
(b)
In order to preserve, protect or sustain the life, health or safety of persons or their property, within the disaster area, it shall be unlawful, during the duration of the emergency or subsequent recovery period, for any person, firm, or corporation located or doing business in the city to overcharge for any goods, materials, services, motel rooms, temporary lodging or houses, sold or rented, within the city. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "overcharging" means charging prices for goods, materials, foods, equipment, supplies, services, labor or housing which are substantially in excess of the customary charges by 25 percent or, in applicable cases, substantially in excess of the suppliers' or providers' costs for such goods, materials, foods, equipment, supplies, services, labor or housing by 25 percent. The existence of overcharging shall be presumed from a 25 percent increase in the price at which the merchandise or cost/rental of housing was offered in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the emergency, but shall not include increases in cost to the supplier directly attributable to the higher cost of material, supplies, and labor costs resulting from the emergency.
(c)
Subsequent recovery period. The term "subsequent recovery period" is defined as that period during which the emergency continues to cause disruptions in the disaster area, but shall not exceed six months after the emergency declaration has been terminated.

(6)
When the city performs the removal of debris as contemplated herein on private roads and private rights-of-way, or clears private property as provided herein, when reasonably possible the city manager or his designee shall contact the private property owner and have the property owner agree to indemnify and hold harmless to the maximum extent provided by law, the federal, state and local government and all, contractors, employees, officers and agents of the city, connected with the rendering of such service.
(7)
Nothing herein shall preclude a first response by the city to clear debris from all roadways (both public and private) as necessary for the movement of emergency vehicles including police, fire and ambulance within the first 72 hours after a disaster declaration.
(8)
Nothing herein shall require the city to remove debris from private property other than private streets, roads and roadways as defined above except where the severity of the situation is of such magnitude or the debris is so widespread that it is determined by the city manager, after consulting with FEMA, to be a significant immediate serious threat to the health, safety and welfare of the city and in the overriding public interest of the city to remove debris from such areas.
(9)
Promulgation of rules and forms. The city manager shall promulgate any rules and forms necessary to detail determinations made pursuant to this section.
(b)
Determination of immediate threat to life, health or safety.

Elimination of serious and immediate threat. It is in the public interest to remove disaster debris where city action is necessary to eliminate an immediate threat to life and/or public health and/or public safety.

Determination. The city manager shall determine, based upon his or her assessment of the seriousness and immediacy of threats to life, health and/or safety posed by disaster debris, whether it is in the public interest to remove disaster debris anywhere in the city. The city manager shall consider the presence and/or imminent development of any of the following dangers or aggravating factors in assessing whether the removal of disaster debris from public property is in the public interest:
a.
Whether there is a significant likelihood that rescue vehicles will be significantly hindered from rendering emergency services to residential and commercial property should the debris be allowed to remain in place absent city removal;
b.
The type of debris is such that it may reasonably cause illness, sickness or disease which could injure or adversely affect the health, safety, or general welfare of those residing and working in the area if it is allowed to remain;
c.
The clearing is necessary to effectuate orderly and expeditious restoration of power, water, sewer, telephone, and other utilities;
d.
The debris is determined by the fire marshal to be dangerous or hazardous;
e.
The debris prevents garbage collection thereby creating a public health hazard;
f.
The debris contains contaminants which have a reasonable likelihood of leeching into the soil and/or ground water;
g.
The debris has a substantially negative impact in preventing or adversely affecting emergency repairs to buildings and/or property;
h.
The debris presents a reasonable danger of being transported by wind and/or water into surrounding waters and thereby increasing the cost of recovery and removal;
i.
The debris poses a significant likelihood that, if left over time, would produce mold which would be injurious to public health;
j.
The presence of the debris adversely impacts the city's recovery efforts;
k.
The debris significantly interferes with drainage or water runoff, so as to be a significant hazard in the event of significant rainfall;
l.
The sheer volume of the debris is such that it is impractical and unreasonable to remove in an orderly and efficient manner absent action by the city; and
m.
The type, extent and nature of the debris is such that it would cause much greater damage if the debris was not removed prior to another significant storm event.
(c)
Access for emergency response and disaster debris removal.

Household waste shall be bagged and placed in garbage receptacles/bins. Structural debris and vegetative debris shall not be bagged, except that loose vegetative debris shall be placed in standard metal or plastic refuse containers of capacity no greater than 32 gallons and weighing no more than 40 pounds or in brown biodegradable paper yard waste bags.
