Sec. 18-36. - Community redevelopment tax incentive program.

Purpose.

In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the City, this Mayor and Council in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations in O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 61, Urban Redevelopment, has designated those areas of the City where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread.
In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

(c)
Levy of increase ad valorem tax on blighted real property.

The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depending on the amount of cost expended by the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00) or portion thereof equaling one (1) year of tax reduction; provided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in city ad valorem taxes for more than two (2) successive years.
