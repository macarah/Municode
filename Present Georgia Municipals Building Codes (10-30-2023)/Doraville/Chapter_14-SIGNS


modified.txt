Sec. 14-0. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
The Mayor and Council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the City's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance.
(b)
Various and diverse businesses are located within the City of Doraville. The need to advertise products and services must be balanced by the City's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, and enhance public safety.
(c)
Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the City without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and to protect values therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the City in the event of police, fire or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies.
(d)
By enacting this chapter, the Mayor and Council intend to:
(1)
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs.
(2)
Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(3)
Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the City by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs.
(4)
Restrict signs and lights which increase traffic and pedestrian hazards.
(5)
Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings.
(6)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
(e)
As these or any regulations can only establish the mechanical limits of signs and not enforce a level of visual quality in sign design, any person planning a sign is strongly encouraged to consider:
(1)
The character of the proposed sign and the audience for which the sign is to be designed. The applicant is urged to think not only of the sign in and of itself bus also in terms of the effects such a sign will have upon the character of the surrounding area.
(2)
The character of the sign structure, that is, the physical means of supporting the sign, and whether that structure could be made an integral part of the sign rather than a separate and frequently distracting element.
(f)
Any person contemplating a sign is also encouraged to contact the City Inspector or a private firm or individual engaged in sign/graphic design for advice or assistance in the planning of such sign.
(g)
It is also the purpose of this chapter to insure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs.
