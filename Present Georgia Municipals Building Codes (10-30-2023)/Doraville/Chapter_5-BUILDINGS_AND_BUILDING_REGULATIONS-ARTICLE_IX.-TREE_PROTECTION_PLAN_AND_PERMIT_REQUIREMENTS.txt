Footnotes:
--- (6) ---
Editor's note— Section 1 of Ord. No. 2009-12, adopted May 26, 2009, set out provisions designated as a new art. VIII. Inasmuch as article so numbered already exists, said provision has been redesignated as art. IX.  Subsequently, section 3 of Ord. No. 2011-36, adopted Sept. 6, 2011, changed the title of Art. IX from "Tree Protection Plan" to "Tree Protection Plan and Permit Requirements."

Sec. 5-270. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose and intent. This article shall be known and may be cited as "The Tree Protection Plan" or the "Tree Protection Ordinance."
Trees are recognized for their importance because they provide shading and cooling, improve stormwater quality, reduce noise, wind, stormwater runoff and soil erosion, provide for wildlife refuge, produce oxygen, filter dust, absorb carbon dioxide, and enhance the aesthetics and economics of all real property. Their contribution to the general well being and quality of life for the citizens of Doraville, as well as the region of metropolitan Atlanta is recognized and valued. Therefore, the City deems it necessary and desirable in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare to enact an ordinance for the conservation, planting and replacement of trees and to prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees and reduction of canopy cover within the City.
The purposes of this article are to:
(1)
Provide standards for the preservation of trees as part of the land development process;
(2)
Protect trees during construction and land development whenever possible in order to enhance the quality of life within the City of Doraville;
(3)
Protect specimen trees, as defined by this article, while providing for a reasonable use of each lot and avoiding regulatory takings;
(4)
Promote a healthy urban forest; and
(5)
Comply with needed requirements to gain recognition for the Tree City USA program.
(b)
Definitions. For purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply. All other words or phrases as appropriate to the context of their uses shall be interpreted as defined in Section 402 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Doraville (hereinafter "zoning ordinance") even though this article shall not be construed to be a zoning ordinance.
Arborist shall mean the agent(s) of the City of Doraville primarily responsible for administering and enforcing the tree protection article under direction of the building inspector. Initially, the arborist shall be a contract professional rather than an employee of the City.
Basal area shall mean the cross-sectional area of a tree trunk at diameter breast height (dbh) expressed herein in terms of "units" per acre.
Bushes shall mean any plant with less than an eight-inch dbh.
Caliper shall mean a forest standard of tree trunk measurement for understory trees or replacement trees. Caliper of the trunk shall be taken at six (6) inches above the ground for trees up to and including four-inch caliper size, and twelve (12) inches above the ground for trees larger than a four-inch caliper.
Critical root zone (CRZ) shall mean the minimum area beneath a tree which must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass to give a tree a reasonable chance of survival. The CRZ will typically be represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree's trunk with a radius equal in feet to one and one-half (1.5) times the number of inches of the trunk diameter. EXAMPLE: The CRZ radius of a twenty-inch diameter is thirty (30) feet.
Density factor analysis shall mean a method of converting the size of any tree to tree density units for purposes of determining whether a given site meets the minimum tree density unit requirement prescribed by this article.
Development activity shall mean any alteration of the natural environment which requires the approval of a development or site plan and issuance of a land disturbance permit. Development activity shall also include the "thinning" or removal of trees from any undeveloped land, including that carried out in conjunction with a forest management program, and the removal of trees incidental to the development of land or to the marketing of land for development.
Diameter breast height (dbh) shall mean the standard of measure of tree size for those trees existing on a site that are at least four (4) inches in diameter at a height of four and one-half (4.5) feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below four and one-half (4.5) feet, then the trunk is measured at its most narrow point beneath the split. For understory tree and replacement tree measurement methods, the tree trunk shall be measured in accordance with the definition of caliper in this section.
Drip line shall mean an imaginary perpendicular surface from a tree's branch tips down to the ground; the circular area of land surrounding the tree from the trunk to the outermost branches. This area is distinguished from, and not to be confused with critical root zone.
Emergency shall mean any unplanned natural or manmade event resulting in damage to property which was in no way caused by the intentional or negligent acts of an owner or occupier of the property.
Georgia Highway 141 Tree Protection Zone shall mean all property within a horizontal distance of one hundred twenty (120) feet of right-of-way of Georgia Highway 141. At major intersections on Georgia Highway 141 having exit and/or entrance ramps, the protection zone shall be reduced to sixty (60) feet. The reduction shall apply for the length of each ramp. The Georgia Highway 141 Tree Protection Zone is a buffer area.
Hardwood tree shall mean any leaf-bearing (nonneedle-bearing) tree that is not coniferous (cone-bearing). This definition is based on the colloquialism, and does not necessary reflect any true qualities of the tree.
Land disturbance permit shall mean any official authorization for construction, grading, grubbing, paving or clearing by the City of Doraville.
Overstory tree shall mean a tree that composes the top layer or canopy of vegetation and will generally reach a mature height of greater than forty (40) feet.
Revegetation shall mean the replacement of trees and landscape materials into the minimum required landscape areas as determined by the zoning ordinance generally, conditions of zoning approval, or the provisions of this article.
Severe pruning shall mean the topping or pruning of any tree that removes more than one-third ⅓ of the canopy of the tree.
Softwood tree shall mean any coniferous (cone bearing) tree, such as pine, fir, hemlock, cedar, etc. This definition is based on the colloquialism and does not necessarily reflect any true qualities of the tree.
Specimen tree shall mean any tree, as defined by this article, in fair or better condition, which qualifies for special consideration for preservation due to size, species, or condition, and which meets the following:
24″ dbh—Large hardwoods such as oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, sweet gums, etc.
30″ dbh—Large softwoods such as pines, deodar cedars, etc.
4″ dbh—Shall trees such as dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.
Provided, however, that a lesser-size tree can be considered by the arborist to be a designated specimen tree if it is a rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical significance. Provided further that a lesser-size tree can be considered by the arborist to be a specimen tree if it is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a landscape project.
Specimen tree stand shall mean any collective group of specimen trees, as defined by this article, which has been determined to be of high value in the opinion of the arborist, and which meets one (1) or more of the following:
(1)
A relatively mature, even aged stand; or
(2)
A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature or ecological value; or
(3)
A stand of historical significance; or
(4)
A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality.
Tree shall mean any self-supporting wood, perennial plant usually having a single trunk, the cutting or pruning of which requires a permit when the plant has an eight-inch dbh.
Tree bank shall mean an account, maintained by the Clerk's Office, of funds contributed from developers as a form of alternative compliance to the requirements of this article. Funds from the tree bank are to be used for the planting of trees on public property, tree removal or pruning on the right-of-way or in public parks, or other tree related projects within the City of Doraville.
Tree board shall mean the Planning Commission appointed by the Mayor and Council to provide nonbinding advice and consultation on the City of Doraville's comprehensive tree management program and care of trees.
Tree density unit shall mean a unit of measure based on diameter breast height of trees which is used to prescribe a minimum number of trees on any given development site.
Tree in fair or better condition shall mean a tree with (a) a life expectancy of greater than fifteen (15) years; (b) a structurally sound trunk, not hollow and having no extensive decay, and less than twenty (20) percent radial trunk dieback; (c) for hardwoods only, no more than one (1) major and several minor dead limbs; and (d) no major insect or pathological problem.
Tree removal permit shall mean a formal letter or permit issued by the City allowing for the removal of said tree(s) from a property.
Tree save area shall mean an area designated for the purpose of meeting tree density requirements, saving natural trees, preserving the root system of natural trees and/or preserving natural buffers.
Tree species selection list shall mean the recommended species of trees in Appendix B of this article.
Understory tree shall mean any tree that grows beneath the overstory, and will generally reach a mature height of less than forty (40) feet.

(Ord. No. 2009-12, § 1, 5-26-09; Ord. No. 2010-29, §§ 1, 2, 10-18-10; Ord. No. 2011-36, § 2, 9-6-11)
Sec. 5-271. - Tree protection.
(a)
Tree survey required.
(1)
Survey required. Unless specifically exempted from this article, before the commencement of any alteration, defoliation or land disturbing activity which requires the issuance of a land disturbance permit, a tree survey shall be completed and submitted to the arborist in accordance with the requirements of this article. When an application for a preliminary plat is made, the applicant shall be required to submit a tree survey.
(2)
Survey requirements. The tree survey shall be in the form of a to-scale map or site plan prepared and sealed by a registered land surveyor, registered professional engineer, registered landscape architect, an arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture or a registered forester noting the location of all specimen trees plus all other trees which will be preserved and counted toward meeting site tree density unit requirements established by this article. Important natural features such as streams and wetlands shall also be shown on the tree survey.
(3)
Specimen trees. All specimen trees and their critical root zones and drip lines shall be labeled, even if the tree trunk is not on the subject property, and must be shown on the tree survey and inventoried by size and species. This includes those specimen trees that are to be preserved as well as those proposed for removal, if any, and the portion of critical root zones and drip lines of trees on abutting properties which are contained within the subject property, to the extent that such drip lines and critical root zones can be determined from the vantage point of the property to be developed. This provision shall not authorize the trespass on other private property abutting the site.
(4)
Other trees to be retained. All other trees that are to be counted toward meeting tree density unit requirements of this article must be shown on the survey and inventoried by size and species. Only trees with a caliper measurement of three (3) inches or greater are to be identified as eligible for tree density unit compliance purposes.
(5)
Trees to be removed. Trees other than specimen trees that are proposed to be removed and which thus cannot be counted toward tree density unit requirements are not required to be counted and shown individually on the tree survey. Such trees shall be estimated in number, size and species of such trees and quantified as part of the total site inventory of tree population.
(6)
Sampling. Sampling methods may be used to determine tree densities for forested areas over two (2) acres.
(7)
Tree save areas. All tree save areas must be delineated on the tree survey. All buffers with existing trees must be delineated on the tree survey as tree save areas. Land disturbance within any buffer is subject to approval by the arborist.
a.
List and tree density unit calculations. The tree survey shall provide an accurate list of those trees to be saved and a total value of tree density units for the entire property.
b.
Tree survey inspection. Within fourteen (14) working days following the receipt of a tree survey, the arborist shall schedule and conduct an inspection of the proposed development site. The applicant or his designee shall be advised as to the date and time of the inspection and given the opportunity to attend and observe the inspection. Following inspection, the arborist, consistent with the purposes of this article, shall advise the applicant in writing or on the survey of any recommended changes to the applicant's tree survey.
c.
Tree protection plan required. Unless specifically exempted from this article, before the commencement of any alteration, defoliation or land disturbing activity which requires the issuance of a land disturbance permit, a tree protection plan shall be completed and submitted to the arborist in accordance with the requirements of this article. The Georgia Highway 141 Tree Protection Zone shall be observed.
d.
Tree protection plan specifications. The tree protection plan shall be a detailed plan designed to protect and preserve trees before, during and for a period of two (2) years after construction. Required specifications for a tree protection plan include the following:
1.
Separate drawing. The tree protection plan shall be submitted as a separate drawing unless the arborist approves the combination of a tree protection plan with a tree replacement plan on a single drawing.
2.
Boundary survey. The tree protection plan shall be submitted on a current boundary survey of the proposed site, drawn to scale, and showing clearly all information required in this section.
3.
Trace identification. The plan shall identify the trace of land involved by acreage and location.
4.
Owner and contact. The name, address and phone number of the owner of the land and the name, address and phone number of any tenant of the property, and a twenty-four-hour emergency contact phone number.
5.
Trees to be protected. The type, location and size as measured at the diameter breast height of all tree(s) to be protected. Only trees designated on the approved tree protection plan will be counted toward meeting the minimum required tree density requirement.
6.
Specimen trees. Locations, species, size, critical root zones, and drip lines of those specimen trees proposed to be protected and, if any, proposed to be removed. The tree protection plan must include any portion of a critical root zone or drip line of any trees on abutting properties proposed to be protected. Removal of specimen trees is subject to approval by the arborist in accordance with this article.
7.
Tree save areas and clearing limits. All natural areas to be retained and buffers shall be included in the tree save area. There shall be no material storage in tree save areas. Limits of clearing and land disturbance such as grading, trenching, etc., where these disturbances may affect tree save areas shall also be shown, including an indication of staging areas for parking, material storage, concrete washout and other areas where tree protection may be affected.
8.
Tree protection methods. Methods of tree protection shall be indicated for all tree save areas, including tree fencing, erosion control, retaining walls, tunneling for utilities, aeration systems, transplanting, staking, signage, geoweb or similar materials, permeable paving, bollards, etc.
9.
Development characteristics. The locations of roads, existing and proposed structures, paving, driveways, cut and fill areas, drainage before and after construction including detention areas, etc.
10.
Utilities and easements. The locations of all existing and proposed utility lines or easements, including the location for any boring sites for underground utilities.
11.
Tree density units. Calculations showing the amount of existing trees to be retained for purposes of complying with the minimum required tree density units required by this article. Only existing trees with a dbh of two (2) inches or greater shall be counted toward meeting the minimum tree density unit requirements.
12.
Irrigation systems. The tree protection plan must also indicate any irrigation systems required by this article.
13.
Additional information. Additional information as required on a case-by-case basis by the arborist.
e.
Arborist authority and action on a tree protection plan. Prior to approval of the tree protection plan, the arborist may require relocation or replacement of trees as uniformly as possible throughout the site. The arborist may require the use of active tree protection fencing for any or all tree save areas. Passive tree protection fencing is to be used only for areas remote from construction activity.
f.
Standards for tree protection during construction.
1.
Materials prohibited in tree save areas. No structure(s) improvement(s), or any activity including solvents, material, construction machinery, portable toilets, construction trailers, or temporary soil deposits shall encroach or be placed within the drip line and within six (6) feet of the area immediately outside the drip line, of any specimen tree or any tree within a tree save area unless authorized by the arborist in writing.
2.
Tree protection devices. Before development, land clearing, filling, or any land alteration, the developer shall be required to erect suitable protective barriers as required by the arborist pursuant to an approved tree protection plan, including tree fences, tree protection signs, and erosion barriers. Inspection of tree protection barriers is required prior to the commencement of any land disturbance or development. Said tree protection measures shall remain in functioning condition until completion of site landscaping or completion of the project as authorized in writing by the arborist, or until the certificate of occupancy is issued.
3.
Active tree protection devices. Materials for active tree protection shall consist of chain link, orange laminated plastic, wooden post and rail fencing or other equivalent restraining material. In addition to fencing where active tree protection is required, each tree to be saved shall be marked at the base of the trunk with blue-colored water-based paint.
4.
Passive tree protection. Materials for passive tree protection shall consist of heavy mil. Plastic flagging, a minimum of four (4) inches wide with dark letters reading "Tree Protection Area—Do Not Enter" or equivalent signage on a continuous, durable restraint.
5.
Additional measures. The developer shall take measures to ensure the health of the protected trees during construction, including but not limited to, the following measures:
(i)
Water, fertilize and treat the trees for pests or disease as needed, in accordance with standards of the International Society of Arboriculture.
(ii)
If grading covers the trees with dust, hose them off.
(iii)
Do not randomly or incorrectly prune live branches so that equipment or structures can "fit" within the tree's protected zone.
(iv)
Do not strip the topsoil or remove the natural leaf mulch or material from beneath a protected tree.
(v)
Trees should be felled away from, rather than into, tree save areas.
(vi)
Provide adequate mulching and water for trees that will be retained.
g.
Tree damage. Any tree, designated on a tree protection plan to be saved, which is damaged during construction or as a result of construction, as determined by the arborist, shall be treated according to accepted standards of the National Arborists Association, or replaced with a tree or trees equal to the tree density unit value of the tree removed. However, any specimen tree damaged as described above shall be replaced with trees equal to two (2) times the unit value of the tree removed or damaged. If a damaged specimen tree must be removed, the area occupied by its drip line must remain in a pervious state. A replacement plan for such area must be approved by the arborist.
h.
Pruning.
1.
Pruning shall not cause long-term health or structural problems and must be done in accordance with International Society of Arboriculture Standards (ANSI A300).
2.
"Topping" or severe pruning is prohibited. Severe pruning seriously affects a tree's food supply, can scald the newly exposed outer bar, make trees vulnerable to insect invasion, stimulate the regrowth of dense, upright branches below the pruning cut, make the tree more vulnerable to wind damage, disfigure the tree aesthetically, and sometimes result in the death of the tree.
(Ord. No. 2009-12, § 1, 5-26-09)
Sec. 5-272. - Tree removal.
(a)
Removal of specimen trees. Unless specifically exempted from the requirements of this article, no specimen tree as defined by this article shall be removed except in accordance with this section.
(1)
Justification for removal. Any applicant proposing to remove a specimen tree(s) regulated by this article shall apply for a tree removal permit. In addition to the requirements for tree removal permits specified by this article, the applicant shall provide a written explanation as to why the specimen tree(s) cannot be retained on the site which shall include a description of all alternative site development plans considered by the applicant to avoid the removal of said specimen tree(s). Said written explanation shall at minimum include the following:
a.
Consideration of whether any buildings or structures, parking areas, stormwater facilities, utilities, driveways or other features of the proposed development can be relocated or designed to retain the specimen tree(s), and the additional costs of such relocations or designs, if any.
b.
Consideration of whether the land area consumed by the proposed development can be reduced via decked parking, reduction of the footprint of a building or structure by increasing the height or number of stories, placement of stormwater facilities underground, and other appropriate means, to retain the specimen tree(s) and the additional costs involved in such surface area consumption, if any.
c.
Consideration of whether the development proposal can be reduced in size, scale, or extent without jeopardizing the economic feasibility of the proposed development.
d.
The total estimated value of the development before approval and upon completion as proposed, if approved.
(2)
Building inspector approval. An application to remove a specimen tree shall require the approval of the building inspector, after review by and recommendation from the arborist. The building inspector may issue a permit to remove one (1) or more specimen trees after finding that one (1) or more of the following conditions are met:
a.
The written analysis provides convincing evidence that alternative site and building designs have been considered by the applicant but would not result in retention of the specimen tree(s).
b.
The additional costs associated with developing the site or constructing buildings as redesigned or reducing the site area consumed to retain the specimen tree(s) would be disproportional to the value of the specimen tree(s) retained, calculated at one hundred dollars ($100.00) per tree density unit.
c.
Retention of the specimen tree(s) would result in less viable economic use of the subject property.
d.
If more than one (1) specimen tree is proposed to be removed, the site design results in the minimum number of specimen trees removed that are necessary to accommodate the proposed development.
e.
A variance to the dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance may be an appropriate remedy to preserve a specimen tree. Where in the opinion of the building inspector one (1) or more variances would enable a site and building design to be accomplished while saving one (1) or more specimen trees, and where the objectives of tree protection would outweigh the purposes of the zoning regulations that would be varied, the building inspector may suggest an applicant apply for variances instead of proposing to remove one (1) or more specimen trees. In the event of a determination by the building inspector that one or more variances to the dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance would not be appropriate, the building inspector should apply the above standards to determine if there is reason to support a finding in favor of granting approval to remove one (1) or more specimen trees.
f.
The request to remove a specimen tree or trees is reasonable considering the remaining specimen trees on the site that will be retained.
g.
The building inspector may apply any or all decision criteria for the removal of trees as specified in this section.
The building inspector may approve or deny any application for a tree removal permit based on the above criteria. Although this article shall not be construed to be a zoning ordinance, the determination of the building inspector pursuant to this provision may be appealed in accordance with section 23-1401.
(3)
Tree bank contribution. When removal of a specimen tree(s) is approved by the arborist, as a condition precedent to issuing said tree removal permit, the project applicant shall contribute to the tree bank an amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each tree density unit of the specimen tree(s) removed, calculated on the basis of Table 1 of this article. In any case where a specimen tree was removed without or prior to a lawfully issued tree removal permit, the amount contributed to the tree bank shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per tree density unit of the specimen tree removed. The tree removal permit shall not be issued, nor shall the specimen tree(s) be removed, until funds are received for deposit in the tree bank. Said amount is in addition to any tree bank contribution which may be required under this section of this article.
(4)
Recompense. Contributions to the tree bank may be adjusted by recompense subject to the following criteria:
a.
Credit, based on the tree density units as specified in Table 2, may be given for new trees planted on the subject site, above and beyond the minimum site density requirements, if approved by the arborist.
b.
Such newly planted trees shall be of the caliper of four (4) inches or greater.
c.
In cases where the obligation is not fully reduced by recompensed trees, the remaining obligation shall be deposited to the tree bank and calculated based on five hundred dollars ($500.00) per density unit.
(b)
Criteria for removal of trees. This section is intended to guide the arborist in considering whether nonspecimen trees shall be permitted to be removed. At the discretion of the building inspector, the provisions of this section may be used along with other criteria specified in section 5-272 in determining whether specimen trees shall be permitted to be removed.
(1)
Tree removal shall be disallowed if soil erosion or runoff problems will result due to topography, soil type, or proximity to floodplain or river protection areas; or if the removal will substantially alter the existing soils adversely with regard to runoff and erosion. Information submitted by an environmental specialist may be used by the arborist in such an evaluation.
(2)
Removal of nonspecimen trees from a site may be allowed at the discretion of the arborist if:
a.
The tree is located in an area where a structure or improvement will be placed and the tree cannot be relocated on the site because of age.
b.
The tree is diseased or structurally unsound.
c.
The tree is injured and/or poses an imminent danger.
d.
The tree interferes with existing utility service.
e.
The tree creates an unsafe vision clearance for vehicular movement.
(c)
Tree removal and construction companies.
(1)
All provisions of this article shall apply to any person removing trees on behalf of any other person, including all tree removal companies, utility companies or persons in the business of removing trees or construction. It shall be unlawful for any person or company to remove or cause to be removed any tree, or undertake any work for which a land disturbance permit is required pursuant to this article, unless a valid permit thereof is in effect and is displayed in accordance with the provisions of this article. If any such work or removal is performed without the permit being displayed as required in this article, such removal or work shall constitute a violation of this article and shall subject the person or company violating this article to all penalties provided herein. However, utility companies may provide emergency work without formal approval; provided, however, that emergency actions are reported in writing to the arborist within three (3) working days after completion of all emergency services. Further, the permit taken by any person, company or utility may include defined areas of tree cutting and trimming under one (1) permit.
(2)
All tree removal companies, utility companies or persons in the business of removing trees or construction shall remove from the site any trees, stumps, limbs or debris caused by activities allowed by the issuance of a permit under this section.
(Ord. No. 2009-12, § 1, 5-26-09)
Sec. 5-273. - Tree replacement and planting.
(a)
Minimum tree density requirements.
(1)
Requirement. A basic requirement of this article is that all applicable sites, including all single-family and/or duplex residential lots one (1) acre or greater in size, shall maintain a minimum tree density of thirty (30) units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area, and is not synonymous with "tree." The density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development for the issuance of a land disturbance permit.
(2)
Methods of achievement. The minimum required tree unit density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards in this article, or by a combination of the two (2). Only existing trees of not less than three (3) inches caliper, to be left in good growing condition on the property, shall be counted toward the minimum required density units.
(3)
Calculation of tree density requirements. The minimum tree density required for any given lot subject to the requirements of this article shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in Appendix A to this article. The minimum required tree density units shall be calculated on the basis of total (gross) area of the site or lot in question, excluding existing easements that are required to be cleared of trees.
(b)
Alternative compliance to tree density requirements.
(1)
Intent. The intent of this article is to ensure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a site will not bear the required density of trees. To provide an alternative in such cases, at the discretion of the arborist, the applicant may contribute funds to the tree bank.
(2)
Standards. The following standards have been established for administering this alternative compliance method. The arborist must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall more than ninety (90) percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question. This provision may require planting less trees of a larger caliper than the minimum required caliper.
(3)
Permit. No land disturbance permit shall be issued until the arborist has approved the request and funds are received for deposit into the tree bank.
(4)
Tree bank. The City of Doraville will accept donations to the Doraville Tree Bank. These donations will be used for the sole purpose of planting trees for public benefit on public property or private property within a public easement within the City of Doraville. For calculating contributions to the tree bank, see Appendix C to this article.
(5)
Fund administration. The tree bank will be administered by the City Manager or designee's office with disbursements of the tree bank funds initiated by the arborist and approved by the City Manager or designee. A report shall be prepared by the Doraville Finance Department/City Manager or designee's office and submitted to the City Manager or designee showing amounts collected, amounts spent, and the type and location of trees planted. The annual audit prepared by an independent auditor shall suffice to meet this requirement.
(c)
Tree replacement plan. Trees must be relocated or replaced on site in accordance with the provisions of this section, unless alternative compliance is permitted pursuant to section 5-272.
(1)
Separate drawing. A separate tree replacement plan indicating the location of all proposed trees for revegetation is required. This plan shall be submitted as a separate drawing but may be subject to the arborist's approval to be included as a part of the Doraville Tree Protection Plan.
(2)
Planting schedules and species names. The tree replacement plan shall include planting schedules with proposed tree species names (botanical and common), quantity, size, spacing and any special planting notes.
(3)
Approved trees. Unless otherwise approved by the arborist, trees selected for replanting must be on the tree species selection list found in Appendix B to this article. Invasive trees shall not be allowed under any circumstances. Trees selected must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be in good vigor in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability. It is desirable that replanted trees be ecologically compatible with site and neighboring sites. Accordingly, the replanted trees shall be of the same or similar species as those removed when practical.
(4)
Flowering ornamental trees. The use of flowering ornamental trees or plants classified as large shrubs may be included in the tree replacement plan, but shall not be used for the purpose of meeting minimum tree density unit requirements for the site unless approved by the arborist.
(5)
Transplanting of trees. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established in the international Society of Arboriculture publication "Tree and Shrub Planting Manual."
(6)
Overstory/understory ratio. Replanting shall be at the ratio of not less than one (1) overstory tree for every three (3) understory trees. Density credit may be met by planting all overstory trees, but not by planting only understory trees. Refer to Appendix A for minimum size requirements for replacement trees.
(7)
Replacement tree size and height. All replanted overstory trees shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet tall and have a trunk of not less than three (3) caliper inches. All replaced understory trees shall be a minimum of six (6) feet tall and have a trunk of not less than two (2) inches. In order to provide sufficient growing area for planted trees, the minimum criteria must be observed unless otherwise approved by the arborist:
Overstory trees—Two hundred (200) square feet of pervious root zone.
Understory trees—Seventy-five (75) square feet of pervious root zone.
Impervious surface area may encroach into no more than thirty (30) percent of the pervious root zone of a tree to be protected or planted, with techniques approved by the arborist.
(8)
Diversity. No more than forty (40) percent of any one (1) genus may be included in any replanting plan. Exceptions to this requirement may be authorized by the arborist, where in his or her opinion, an exception is justified based on compliance with the purpose of this article.
(9)
Planting and staking details. Planting and staking details shall be provided on the plan as determined by the arborist using International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) standards.
(10)
Debris. All debris from trees cut or substantial damage shall be removed from the site or chipped in a timely fashion including the removal or chipping of any portion of the tree stump above the original natural grade or elevation of land unless exempted by the arborist for a specific reason such as, but not limited to, unusually large size or age.
(11)
Practices. The City of Doraville encourages environmentally sustainable design practices, such as drought-tolerant landscaping, keeping turf away from native trees, and planting trees strategically for energy conservation.
(12)
Maintenance. All replacement trees will be maintained properly to ensure their survivability.
(d)
Street trees. The requirements of this section shall be independent of and in addition to all other sections of this article.
(1)
Required. Street tree planting is required along all new local, collector, and arterial streets in the City of Doraville and private streets within commercial, industrial or residential subdivisions.
(2)
Responsibility. The subdivider, owner of land to be dedicated as a public street, or the developer of a private street, shall at the time of preliminary plat approval, submit a plan for the provision of street trees along all said roads. It is the intent of this section that the subdivider carefully position street trees on the plan while taking into account future driveway and sidewalk locations if not constructed simultaneously with the construction of the public or private street, suitable arrangements must be made for either the subdivider/developer or individual builders to install street trees according to a plan approved by the City Council as a part of preliminary plat approval, prior to dedication or opening of said street. It is the preference of the City that the subdivider shall install said street trees prior to the dedication or opening of the public or private street; however, the City Council may accept an agreement where the responsibility for street tree planting is shifted to the owners or individual builders of the lots to be subdivided. Any such responsibility shall be legally transferred in a form acceptable to the City Attorney.
(3)
Location. Trees must be planted within the public right-of-way or if right-of-way width is insufficient to accommodate said street trees, then they may be planted on private property abutting the public right-of-way within a street tree easement dedicated to the City. For local, arterial and collector streets with speeds less than or equal to forty-five (45) m.p.h.: on streets with curb and gutter, street trees should be a minimum of one and one-half (1.5) feet behind the curb and may be placed between the sidewalk, if present, and the back of the curb. On streets without curb and gutter, the trees should be at least seven (7) to twenty (20) feet from the edge of the traveled way. A bike path is not considered part of the traveled way. Adequate sight distance must be available from intersecting streets and driveways. Utility installations must be coordinated with tree locations. In many cases, the underground locations have the potential for conflict. Street trees shall have equal bearing when considering utility location.
(4)
Guidelines. The guidelines below are intended to avoid conflicts with infrastructure; they are recommendations only and are subject to the approval of the arborist and, in the case of preliminary plat review, the City Council.

Minimum landscaping requirements for surface parking lots. All new parking facilities for new multi-family and non-residential uses shall present a landscape plan to the Community Development Director for approval, indicating that the surface parking lot will meet the minimum barrier curb and landscaping requirements as follows:
(1)
Barrier curbs or landscape strips shall be installed around the perimeter of the parking lot and around landscaped areas that are required in this article, except where the perimeter abuts an adjacent building or structure, at points of ingress and egress into the facility, and at points of stormwater runoff so as to prevent encroachment of vehicles onto adjacent property, rights-of-way and landscaped areas.
(2)
Barrier curbs or wheel stops shall be a minimum of six (6) inches in height and a minimum of eight (8) inches in width and permanent in nature. Barrier curbs and wheel stops shall be constructed of concrete or other durable material. Such curbs shall be securely installed and maintained in good condition.
(3)
Where the end of a parking space abuts a landscaped area, barrier curbs or wheel stops shall be placed in the parking space at a minimum of two (2) feet from the end of the parking space adjacent to the landscaped area. This two-foot wide area may have the pavement removed and be developed as part of the required landscaped area.
(4)
Surface parking lots shall have a minimum landscaped area equal to at least ten (10) percent of the paved area of the lot.
(5)
A minimum of one (1) drought tolerant, overstory tree per eight (8) parking spaces shall be included in the required landscaped areas. For the purpose of satisfying this requirement, existing trees remaining that are two and one-half (2½) inches or more in DBH, and are located inside the proposed parking lot or adjacent to within twenty (20) feet of the parking lot, shall be considered to be equivalent to one (1) or more newly planted trees on the basis of one (1) tree for each two and one-half (2½) inches of caliper.
(6)
In addition to trees, ground cover shall also be provided to protect tree roots and to prevent erosion. Ground cover shall consist of plants, organic mulch and other similar landscaping materials. Such ground cover shall be maintained at a maximum height of two and one-half (2½) feet, except where such shrubs are screening the parking surface from an adjacent residential use. Plants shall not be planted within the structural rootplate of trees; plantings within the critical root zone shall be dug by hand.
(7)
Trees planted in the interior of a parking lot shall comply with the minimum pervious root zone requirements noted in this article.
(8)
Continuous landscaped buffer strips shall be constructed along sidewalks and public rights-of-way where surface parking lots are adjacent to such sidewalks or public rights-of-way except at points of ingress and egress into the facility. Such landscaped buffer strips shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width and shall contain, in addition to ground cover, trees planted a maximum of forty (40) feet on center along the entire length. Trees shall be planted at a minimum of thirty (30) inches from any barrier curb so as to prevent injury to trees from vehicle bumpers.
(9)
Where landscaped area is located adjacent to vehicle overhangs, the trees shall be planted in line with the side stripes between parking spaces in order to avoid injury to trees by vehicle bumpers.
(10)
All landscaped areas, including trees located in the public right-of-way that are counted in the fulfillment of this requirement, shall be properly maintained in accordance with approved landscape plans. If a tree or any plant material dies, it shall be replaced within six (6) months so as to meet all requirements of this section and to allow for planting in the appropriate planting season.
(11)
The Community Development Director may allow a reduction of parking spaces up to ten (10) percent of the minimum required spaces to comply with the parking lot landscape requirements of this section.
(12)
Upon written application by any person subject to the provisions of this section, the Community Development Director is hereby authorized to grant administrative variances to the requirements of this section only upon making all of the following findings:
a.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, topography, subsurface conditions, overhead structures or the existence of sufficient trees in the public right-of-way within ten (10) feet and adjacent to the parking lot.
b.
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
c.
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this article and of chapter 23 of this Code.

Sec. 5-274. - Application and permits.
(a)
Application requirements. When a person applies for a land disturbance permit, such person shall also file an application for a tree removal permit providing the following information:
(1)
A complete tree survey, as specified in section 5-271.
(2)
A complete tree protection plan, as specified in section 5-271.
(3)
A complete tree replacement plan, as specified in section 5-271.
The arborist shall be authorized to and may waive the application requirements of this article in cases where the proposed development will not involve the removal or replacement of trees, or in cases where the submission of a tree survey, tree protection plan, and/or tree replacement plan would be unduly burdensome given the nature of the development proposed; provided, however, that the arborist shall in all instances at least require a sketch showing proposed changes to ensure compliance with this article.
Each applicant requesting a permit under the provisions of this article, except those pertaining to property solely within a public right-of-way, shall deposit with the City of Doraville a fee as set forth by the Mayor and City Council, as amended from time to time. The fee shall be nonrefundable.
(b)
Permit procedures.
(1)
Approval by arborist. Prior to the issuance of a tree removal permit and a land disturbance permit, a tree survey, tree protection plan, and tree replacement plan must be submitted to and approved by the arborist as required by this article. Said arborist's approval must be achieved prior to submission of a final design plan application to the City Council, whichever has jurisdiction. All tree surveys, tree protection plans, and tree replacement plans and related documentation shall be reviewed by the arborist for conformance with the provisions of this article and either approved, returned for revision, or denied. If denied, the reasons for denial shall be annotated on the application and/or plans, as appropriate or otherwise stated in writing.
(2)
Relationship to other reviews. Approved tree surveys, tree protection plans, and tree replacement plans shall be accepted by the City Council, as a pre-approved element of the design plan or certificate of appropriateness, respectively.
(3)
Issuance. After the tree survey, tree protection plan, and tree replacement plan are approved, and after the remaining elements of the design plan are approved by the City Council, tree removal permits shall be issued and development plan approvals with regard to conformance with this article shall be granted.
(4)
Inspections. All tree protection measures shall be installed prior to any land disturbance, and the arborist shall be contacted for a pre-construction conference prior to land disturbance. As a condition of the issuance of a permit, the applicant shall agree in writing to entry onto the applicant's premises by representatives of the City as designated by the arborist to inspect the permit and activities at any time, and such entry shall be lawful. Failure to allow such entry shall be unlawful and shall constitute failure to display the permit as required under this section. Land disturbance may proceed only after a tree removal permit and land disturbance permit are obtained. The arborist shall make unscheduled inspections before and during development to ensure protection of trees, critical root zones, drip lines, and buffer zones. After completion of a development, but prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the arborist will conduct an on-site inspection of the site to ensure compliance with the approved tree protection plan and approved tree replacement plan. The building inspector will be charged with the responsibility of inspecting the site to ensure that trees are adequately protected during any grading of the property for infrastructure installation.
(5)
Display of permit. The applicant shall prominently display the tree removal permit on the site for which the permit is issued. Such permit shall be displayed continuously while trees are being removed or replaced or work done as authorized on the permit.
(Ord. No. 2009-12, § 1, 5-26-09)
Sec. 5-275. - Administration and enforcement.
(a)
Emergencies. In case of emergencies, such as hurricane, windstorm, flood, freeze or other disasters, the requirements of these regulations may be waived by the arborist or other designated official, upon a finding that such waiver is necessary so that the public or private work to restore order in the City will not be impeded.
(b)
Variances. Although this article shall not be construed to be a zoning ordinance, the Mayor and City Council may, upon appropriate application in accordance with section 23-1402 of the Zoning Code, grant a variance to the terms and provisions of this article.
(c)
Appeals. Although this article shall not be construed to be a zoning ordinance, any person adversely affected by a decision of the arborist or building inspector in the administration, enforcement or interpretation of any of the terms or provisions of this article may appeal such decision to the Mayor and City Council in accordance with the provisions of section 23-1401 of the zoning code.
(d)
Withholding of certificate of occupancy. The building inspector may withhold the issuance of the required certificate of occupancy, or permits and inspections, for any development until the provisions of this article have been fully met.
(e)
Enforcement and penalties.
(1)
Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation violating any provisions of this article shall upon conviction be punished as described in section 1-12 of the Municipal Code of the City of Doraville, which provides for fines up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), imprisonment up to ninety (90) days and/or community service up to ninety (90) days. In addition, the person, firm or corporation may be enjoined from continuing the violation. Each tree cut, damaged or poisoned shall constitute a separate offense.
(2)
Stop-work orders. Upon issuance of a stop-work order by the building inspector, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this article shall be immediately stopped, such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, the owner's authorized agent or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, no written notice shall be required. A stop-work order shall be considered a suspension of the land disturbance permit.
(3)

(a)
Appendix A—Density Factor Analysis. A basic condition of this article is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree density of thirty (30) units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area and is not synonymous with "tree."
The minimum tree density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two (2).
For density factor analysis, the following formula shall apply:
SDF = EDF + RDF
WHERE:
SDF (Site Density Factor) = The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (thirty (30) units per acre).
EDF (Existing Density Factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on a site.
RDF (Replacement Density Factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on a site.
PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATING THE REQUIRED TREE PLACEMENT:
EXPAND
Step 1:   Calculate the Site Density Factor (SDF):
The SDF is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by 30.
EXAMPLE: A 2.2 acre site has a SDF of 2.2 × 30 = 66
Step 2:   Calculate the Existing Density Factor (EDF):
The Existing Density Factor, EDF, is determined by converting the diameter breast height (dbh) of individual existing trees to density factor units as shown in the following Table 1. These units are totaled to determine the EDF for the site.
EXAMPLE: A total of eight (8) existing trees will remain on the 2.2 acre site in Step 1.
These existing trees include:
3—14″ pines
3—18″ oaks
1—20″ hickory
1—30″ oak
When converted to density factor units using Table 1 (on the following page) we arrive at the following values for existing trees on the site:
DBH UNITS × NUMBER OF TREES
14″ 4.8 × 3 = 14.4
18″ 5.7 × 3 = 17.1
20″ 6.0 × 1 = 6.0
36″ 8.4 × 1 = 8.4
TOTAL: 45.9 units
The total units, 45.9 are the EDF (Existing Density Factor). This is the density value of existing trees that will remain on the site.
Step 3: Calculate the Replacement Density Factor (RDF):
Replacement Density Factor (RDF) is determined by subtracting the EDF from the SDF.
EXAMPLE: 66 (SDF) - 45.9 (EDF) = 20.1
This means that 20.1 tree units are required as replacements for the total site to meet the requirement of thirty (30) units per acre.
The Density Factor credit for each caliper size of replacement (new) trees is shown in Table 2 on the following page.

  A seven-gallon container-grown pine tree is given replacement credit of 0.3 units. The minimum tree size for an understory tree is two (2) inches. The minimum size for an overstory tree is three (3) inches.
For tree relocation, replacement units will be granted to trees relocated on site. Tree relocation is subject to the arborist's approval.

Appendix B—Tree Species Selection List. See chapter 5, article XII for a list of permitted and prohibited tree species.
(c)
Appendix C—Formula for Determining Contributions to The Tree Bank The required contribution amount is five hundred dollars ($500.00) per tree density unit, based on cost of materials, labor and guarantee for trees planted in the Doraville area.
EXAMPLE: To determine the appropriate contribution, first calculate the Density Factor Deficient (DFD) or unit value which cannot be planted on the site.
Determine the Density Factor Deficient (DFD) using the formula:
DFD = SDF - EDF - Approved RDF
WHERE:
SDF (Site Density Factor) = The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (thirty (30) units per acre or whatever Doraville chooses).
EXAMPLE: A 2.2-acre site will have a required Site Density Factor of 66.0 units (2.2 × 30 = 66).
EDF (Existing Density Factor) = Density of existing trees to be preserved on a site. The site has existing trees totaling 45.9 units (Existing Density Factor).
Approved RDF (Replacement Density Factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on a site. Due to space limitations, the site can only bear 15.0 units as replacement trees.
EXAMPLE:
DFD = SDF - EDF - Approved RDF
DFD = 66 - 45.9 - 15
DFD = 5.1 (the number of tree density units that cannot be planted on site)
This means that the value of 5.1 tree density units must be contributed to the Doraville Tree Bank. Determine the acceptable contribution amount as follows:
5.1 tree density units × $500.00 per tree density unit = $2,550.00
$2,550 = Total Contribution to Tree Bank
