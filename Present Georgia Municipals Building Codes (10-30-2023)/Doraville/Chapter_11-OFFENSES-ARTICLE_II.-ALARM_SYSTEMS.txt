Alarm system means any single device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other activity requiring immediate attention and to which the police department is expected to respond, but does not include alarms installed in motor vehicles or fire alarms.
Alarm signal means a detectable signal, either audible or visual, generated by an alarm system, to which the police are expected to respond.
Alarm user means any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, proprietorship, governmental or educational entity or any other entity owning or leasing an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the protection of such premises.
Automatic dial protection device means an automatic dialing device or an automatic telephone dialing alarm system and shall include any system which upon being activated, automatically initiates to the Doraville Police Department, a recorded message or code signal indicating a need for police response.
Chief of police means the chief of police of the Doraville Police Department or his designee.
Improper alarm activation means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, the alarm users employees or agents, and signals to summon police individual unless law enforcement response was canceled by the alarm user or the alarm users agent before police individual arrive at the alarm location. Improper alarm activation shall also mean activation of such alarm due to power failure when such power failure is not caused by fire, forced entry or attempted forced entry. An improper alarm activation shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by unusually violent conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered an improper alarm activation if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the user's alarm company, or designee, to test the system. An alarm activation is improper within the meaning of this article when, upon inspection by the chief of police or his designee, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system.
