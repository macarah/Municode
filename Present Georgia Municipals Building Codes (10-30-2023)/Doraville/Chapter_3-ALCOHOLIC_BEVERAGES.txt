the City Council finds:
(1)
Nudity, partial nudity, conduct by bikini-clad persons, and/or sexual conduct coupled with alcohol in public places begets negative secondary effects, including sexual, lewd, lascivious, and salacious conduct among patrons and employees resulting in violation of laws and in dangers to the health, safety and welfare of the public;
(2)
Physical contact between employees of alcoholic beverage establishments, including "bed" dances, "couch" dances, and "lap" dances as they are commonly called, are associated with and can lead to illicit sexual activities, including masturbation, lewdness, and prostitution, as well as other negative effects, including sexual assault;
(3)
The City finds that the foregoing conduct, even when said employees are technically not nude or semi-nude as defined in other portions of Doraville City regulations, is substantially similar to and presents similar concerns as conduct by nude and semi-nude performers in sexually oriented businesses;
(4)
Each of the negative effects targeted by this section constitutes a harm which the City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing such negative effects, which is the City's rationale for this section, exists independent of any comparative analysis between the regulated establishments and other, non-regulated establishments. The City finds that the cases and secondary effects documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to the City's interest in preventing illicit sexual behavior.
The City hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to adverse secondary effects, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.
(c)
On-premises conduct. No licensee, as defined in this chapter, shall knowingly violate the following regulations or knowingly or recklessly allow an employee or any other person to violate the following regulations:
(1)
No person shall engage in masturbation, sexual intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, sodomy, bestiality, or flagellation on the licensed premises.
(2)
No employee shall knowingly touch, engage in physical contact with, caress, or fondle the breast, buttocks, lap, pubic region, or genitals of a patron, whether directly or through clothing or other covering, on the licensed premises.
(3)
No patron shall knowingly touch, engage in physical contact with, caress, or fondle the breast, buttocks, lap, pubic region, or genitals of an employee, whether directly or through clothing or other covering, on the licensed premises.
(4)
No employee shall expose his or her genitals, pubic hair, buttocks, natal cleft, perineum, anus, vulva, or the female breast below a horizontal line across the top of the areola and extending across the width of the breast at that point (except that the exposure of the cleavage of the female breasts exhibited by a bikini, dress, blouse, shirt, leotard, or similar wearing apparel is not prohibited) to a patron on the licensed premises. This subsection (4) does not apply to conduct in theaters, concert halls, art centers, museums, or similar establishments that are primarily devoted to the arts or theatrical performances, when the performances that are presented are expressing matters of serious literary, artistic, scientific, or political value. The exception in the previous sentence shall not be construed to apply to any sexually oriented business as defined in the Doraville Code of Ordinances.
(d)
[Employee.] Employee, for purposes of this section, means any person who regularly performs any service on the licensed premises on a full-time, part-time, or contract basis, regardless of whether the person is denominated an employee, independent contractor, lessee, or otherwise. Employee does not include a person exclusively on the premises for repair or maintenance of the premises or for the delivery of goods to the premises.
(e)
Severability. Notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative intent, it is hereby declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if any provision of this section, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid, then the remaining provisions and the application of such provisions to any person or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby, and it is hereby declared that the provisions would have been passed independently of such provision so known to be invalid. Should any procedural aspect of this chapter be invalidated, such invalidation shall not affect the enforceability of the substantive provisions of this section.

ARTICLE IV. - VIOLATIONS

(a)
Any license issued under this chapter may be revoked or suspended by the City Clerk for good cause. The notice of suspension or revocation shall be in writing to the license or permit holder and shall be served in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested, stating the action and the reason therefor and the notice of the right to appeal the decision pursuant to subsection 1-15(b) of this Code.
(b)
"Good cause" for the suspension or revocation of any license under this chapter shall mean as follows:
(1)
The violation of any provision of articles II, III, IV, V or VI as amended from time to time, by either the license holder or any person acting on his behalf, directly or indirectly, either as agent, servant, employee or otherwise; or
(2)
The violation of any law, statute or regulation made pursuant to authority granted for the licensing of such businesses by either the license holder or any person acting on his behalf, directly or indirectly, either as agent, servant, employee or otherwise, which occurs in or upon the premises for which the license is granted; or
(3)
The violation of any federal, state or local law or county or City ordinance (other than traffic ordinances) either by the license holder or any person acting on his behalf, directly or indirectly, either as agent, servant, employee or otherwise, which occurs in or upon the premises for which the license is granted; or
(4)

It is the intent and purpose of the City that the license holder be responsible for and be held accountable for any activity which constitutes good cause hereunder, and any such license may be suspended or revoked if such activity occurred, regardless of the license holder's presence or knowledge thereof.

Sales to minors.

Intent. Is it the purpose of this section to administratively act upon a license where sales to minors have occurred at a licensed establishment. The administrative penalties set forth in this subsection (d) shall not prevent suspension or revocation of a license where other offenses occur in addition to sales to minors.

Definition of event for administrative action. Where a violation of this section regarding minors originates from a single event that occurs in a 24-hour day, then such violation shall be deemed to be one (1) violation for administrative purposes. For example, if a server serves an alcoholic beverage to a minor and is allowed to do so by such server's manager, while two (2) criminal charges may be brought these events shall be deemed to be one (1) administrative violation so long as the offenses occurred within one, 24-hour day. If two (2) different servers serve two (2) different minors and the manager allows such service while four (4) criminal offenses may have occurred, the offenses shall be deemed one (1) offense for administrative purposes so long as the offenses occurred within one, 24-hour day. Regardless of the number of criminal offenses which occur in any 24-hour day, the same shall be deemed one (1) offense for administrative action.
(3)
Administrative violation actions. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if the license holder is solely in violation of the provisions of section 3-26, regulating sales to minors, the license shall be suspended or revoked as follows:
a.
First violation within a 24-hour day in a 12-month period starting upon the date of the accusation of the offense—The license shall be suspended for a period up to fifteen (15) consecutive days.
b.
Second violation in the same period as set out above in subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3)—Suspension for a period up to thirty (30) consecutive days.
c.
Third violation in the same period as set out above in subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3)—Revocation for a 12-month period beginning upon the date of the Mayor and Council finding.
(e)
Upon suspension of the license under subsection (d), the license holder shall place a sign on all entrances used by the public to access the premises and at each cash register stating the following:
"This establishment's license to sell alcoholic beverages has been suspended for the period ___________ to ___________." (insert dates and times).
