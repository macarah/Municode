ARTICLE XV. - CONDITIONAL USES

Sec. 23-1501. - Conditional use permits.
modified
(a)
Purposes. The purpose of a conditional use permit (CUP) is to allow the establishment of uses which may be suitable only in certain locations in a zoning district or only when subject to standards and conditions that assure compatibility with adjoining uses. Conditional uses are those uses which are generally compatible with the permitted land uses in a given zoning district, but which require individual review of their proposed location, design and configuration, and the imposition of conditions in order to ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location within a given zoning district. Only those uses enumerated as conditional uses in a particular zoning district shall be authorized as conditional uses. The CUP application must be accompanied by a site plan or building floor plan as deemed appropriate by the Community Development Director, drawn to scale depicting how the proposed conditional use will conform to all space limits, buffers, parking and loading provisions, and other provisions of the Code of Ordinances.
