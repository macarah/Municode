ARTICLE IV. - STORMWATER UTILITY

Sec. 65-195. - Findings.
The city council makes the following findings:
(1)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(2)
The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways as described in the professional engineering and financial analysis. The service and benefit rendered, or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities, may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure.
(3)
The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its program operational and capital improvement needs.
(4)
The professional engineering and financing analysis, known as the Stormwater Utility Implementation Report, prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer, properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy.
(5)
Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the city in concert with other water resource management programs.
(6)
The city council finds, concludes and determines that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in the city.
(7)
An equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of stormwater user fee charges upon properties that is related to the burden of stormwater quality and/or quantity control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city. Such a schedule of user fee charges can be supplemented by other funding sources/methods to address specific needs, including, but not limited to, allocations from the general fund. Based on the recommended funding strategy, it is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater management services continue to be funded from the city's general fund tax revenues, and therefore that the city council may allocate general fund tax revenues to support the stormwater management program in the future in the form of a combination of user fee charge payments for city-owned properties and supplemental allocation from the general fund. In addition, the city may utilize and allocate other supplemental funding sources/methods to address specific stormwater management program requirements, including but not limited to, development review and inspection fees, special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST), revenue bonds, loans, and any other supplemental funding sources that can be appropriately utilized to fund the city's comprehensive stormwater management program.
(8)
A credit to the stormwater user fee charge is an appropriate means of adjusting the user fee charge in recognition of the specific efforts, and associated costs, undertaken by qualified private properties and their stormwater management control systems that effectively reduce the burden of stormwater runoff quantity and/or quality impacts from private property that the city would have to otherwise manage at its own cost and expense. Mitigation of stormwater runoff impacts is accomplished by properly designing, constructing and maintaining stormwater controls that reduce the impact that land development activities and impervious surfaces have on the city's drainage system.

Sec. 65-196. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Attached residential dwelling property means developed land containing attached dwelling units such as duplexes, triplexes, quadruplexes, apartments, condominiums, townhouses, or other residential structures not listed herein where two or more family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. Developed land may be classified as an attached residential dwelling property despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports and small storage buildings. Developed land may be classified as an attached residential dwelling property despite the presence of a commercial use. The term "attached residential dwelling property" shall not include developed land containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, hotels, motels, retirement centers, nursing homes and assisted living home.
Credit means a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater use fee charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater management system, or facility, or the provision of a service or activity by a property owner, whereby the stormwater control system, facility, service or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities for that property. Credits for on-site stormwater systems shall be generally proportional to the effect that such systems have on mitigating the runoff characteristics from a property, in whole or in part, including peak discharge rate, runoff volume, runoff velocity and pollutant discharge.
Customers of the stormwater utility includes all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the stormwater utility. This benefit includes, but is not limited to, the stormwater utility's administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff of private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities, and activities.
Detached residential dwelling property means developed land containing one detached dwelling unit, including residential homes, manufactured homes and mobile homes on individual lots. Developed land may be classified as a detached residential dwelling property despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports and small storage buildings. Developed land may be classified as a residential dwelling property despite the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas, such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or additions to the building which are used as offices, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship or similar nonresidential uses. The term "detached residential dwelling property" shall not include developed land containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, hotels, motels, retirement centers, nursing homes and assisted living homes. Detached residential dwelling property is sometimes referred to as single-family residential (SFR) property within the city's stormwater utility literature and documents.
Developed land means all property altered from its natural undeveloped condition by the construction or installation of 1,000 or more square feet of impervious surface.
Dwelling unit shall mean a structure, which contains one or more bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen facility.
Equivalent runoff unit (ERU) means the median area of impervious surface established in residential dwelling properties in the city as determined by the city's consulting stormwater engineer, and shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater user fee charges to residential dwelling properties, and other developed properties. Three thousand three hundred square feet of impervious surface shall be one equivalent runoff unit (ERU).
Hydrologic response, when applied to a parcel of property, means the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from the property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater, the parcel's antecedent moisture and the parcel's geologic condition.
Impervious surface means the area that prevents or impedes the infiltration of rainfall or stormwater runoff into the soil as the water would have infiltrated under natural conditions prior to the parcel's development. Typical areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, swimming pools, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, awnings and other manmade surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of rainfall or stormwater runoff.
Occupant means the individual residing or conducting business on the property. In a family or household circumstance, the individual responsible for the obligation imposed by this article shall be the adult head of the household. In a commercial circumstance, the adult legally responsible for the management or condition of the property shall be responsible for the obligation imposed by this article.
Other developed properties includes all property not defined as residential dwelling property, including but not limited to, commercial and office buildings, shopping and retail centers, public buildings and structures, gasoline stations, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private educational facilities, hospitals, convalescent centers, hotels, motels, retirement centers, nursing homes, assisted living homes, commercial uses, industrial uses, institutional uses and agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces. Other developed properties is sometimes referred to as non-single-family residential (NSFR) property within the city's stormwater utility literature and documents.
Owner means the legal owner of record as shown on the tax records of the county except where there is a recorded land sale contract, the purchaser thereunder shall be deemed the owner.
Stormwater management services means all services provided by the city, which mean the following:
(1)
Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the city;
(2)
Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities;
(3)
Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs;
(4)
Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems and facilities; and
(5)
Education of the public as to the stormwater issues.
Stormwater management systems means systems which address the issues of drainage conveyance, flood control and water quality management (pollutant discharge and erosion and sedimentation control) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds and reservoirs. Stormwater management systems address these issues through improving, maintaining, regulating and funding the necessary instrumentalities used in the collection, conveyance, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater runoff or surface water drainage.
Stormwater user fee charges means the periodic rate, fee or charge applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the stormwater utility. Stormwater user fee charges are based on measurable parameters, which influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious surface on each parcel of developed land. The use of impervious surface as the user fee charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges, or rounding to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat rate charges for one or more classes, or similarly situated properties, whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater user fee charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, the inspection of development projects, the inspection of on-site stormwater control systems and enhanced levels of stormwater management services above those normally provided by the stormwater utility.
Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have minimal impervious surface, which impedes the infiltration of stormwater runoff or causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. For purposes of this article, the term "undeveloped land" includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of less than 1,000 square feet of impervious surface.
User means any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management. The occupant of any habitable property is deemed the user. If the property is not occupied, then the owner shall be deemed the user.

Sec. 65-197. - Establishment of a stormwater utility.
(a)
The city hereby establishes a stormwater utility within the city, which shall serve as the organizational and accounting entity for the city's stormwater management program. The stormwater utility shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater quantity and quality controls, systems and facilities. The stormwater utility shall be under the operational direction of the city administrator. The corporate limits of the city, as increased from time to time, shall constitute the boundaries of the stormwater utility's service district.
(b)
The city shall amend the existing Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund to include a stormwater utility function within the existing enterprise fund. The stormwater utility shall be established and defined within the city budget and accounting systems, separate and apart from the general fund and the water and sewer function of the resulting enterprise fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the Water, Sewer and Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund, with the stormwater utility fund revenues to be held and invested in trust for the purposes of the stormwater utility, including, but not limited to operational actions, capital project construction, regulatory compliance, and/or repayment of revenue bonds used to fund capital projects.
(Ord. No. 2005-10, ยง 1(25-76), 5-16-2005)
Sec. 65-198. - Scope of responsibility for the stormwater management system.
(a)
The city stormwater management system consists of all city streets, curbs and gutters, rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainageways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catchbasins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or manmade, within the political boundaries of the city which control and/or intentionally diverts stormwater runoff, or surface waters, from its public streets as well as public and private properties. The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of the city stormwater management system which are:
(1)
Located on public property or within public streets, rights-of-way and easements;
(2)
The segments which are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of stormwater management systems and facilities; or
(3)
Located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities.
Operation and maintenance of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the city and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, or its occupant, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the state and the United States of America.
(b)
It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with an individual person, or to any specified property, within or without the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any permit approval, inspection, or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity by, or upon property, not owned by the city, pursuant to any other regulatory ordinance, the issuance of such permit, plan approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the city, its officers, employees or agents.

Sec. 65-199. - Stormwater user fee chargesโDetermination and modification.
Stormwater user fee charges shall be determined and modified from time to time by action of the city council. In setting or modifying such user fee rates, it shall be the objective of the city council to establish rates, fees and charges that are fair, equitable and reflect the value of stormwater management services and facilities relative to the benefit derived by the properties. Stormwater user fee charges shall be sufficient to meet the cost of implementing the identified components and activities of the city's stormwater management program.

Sec. 65-200. - SameโApplicability of exemptions and credits; enforcement methods and inspections.
(a)
Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from the stormwater utility user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. A stormwater utility user fee charge Credit Technical Manual (hereafter referred to as the credit manual) has been prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer specifying the design and performance standards of on-site stormwater management controls, systems, facilities, activities, and services which qualify for application of a stormwater user fee charge credit, how such credits shall be calculated and how such credits can be maintained by the customer. This credit manual has been separately approved by the city council and, by reference, incorporated into this section. Any amendments to such credit manual in the future, which are approved by the city council, shall also be incorporated into this section by reference.
(1)
Undeveloped land shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(2)
Railroad rights-of-way (tracks) shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, and/or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(3)
Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way and road systems. However, maintenance buildings and/or other developed land used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(4)
A stormwater user fee charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements, standards and criteria contained in the credit manual. The amount of credit, or reduction of the stormwater user fee charge, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the credit manual.
(5)
Any credit allowed against the stormwater user fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the credit manual and/or upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The city may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the credit manual.
(b)
All property owners of developed real property within the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all city development regulations, ordinances and the laws of the state and the United States of America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the city in the municipal court. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From the date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the superior court of the county. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private property and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with applicable city development regulations and ordinances.

Sec. 65-201. - SameโInitial billing period; ERU standards; collection and liability of payment.
(a)
Stormwater user fee charges shall be billed starting with the first billing cycle in July 2005, except as specific exemptions and credits may apply.
(b)
The following ERU standards shall apply:
(1)
Stormwater user fee charges are based upon the number of ERUs, or increment thereof, associated with developed land. The user fee charge per ERU shall be determined and modified from time to time by resolution of the city council and as set forth in the city's established fee schedule.
(2)
Detached residential dwelling properties. Each detached residential dwelling property, as defined herein, shall be charged a stormwater user fee of one ERU per month.
(3)
Attached residential dwelling properties. All attached residential dwelling properties as defined herein shall be charged the rate applicable to one ERU times the number of dwelling units located on the property (ERU total ) times an adjustment factor (AF). The adjustment factor (AF) has been determined to be 0.45. For each monthly user fee charge billing, the ERU total figure will be multiplied by the adjustment factor (AF) which adjusts the ERU total to equal the median impervious surface of a statistical comparison of attached residential dwelling properties versus detached residential dwelling properties in the city. Therefore, each attached residential dwelling unit will be charged a stormwater user fee of 0.45 ERU per dwelling unit per month.
(4)
Other developed properties. All developed land not classified as a residential dwelling property shall be billed one ERU for every 3,300 square foot increment of impervious surface. In cases where a fractional ERU is calculated, the total ERU for the customer account will be rounded down to the next whole number for billing. Increments of impervious surface less than 3,300 square feet shall not be billable except in the case of minimum bills (i.e., 1,000 to 3,299 square feet of impervious surface), which shall be billed at the rate for one ERU. For customers located within a development with shared common parking or other impervious surface, the amount of shared common impervious surface associated with the developed land shall be apportioned to the individual customer by a percentage of the impervious surface attributable to the customer as determined by the total common shared impervious surface times the percentage of the customer's square feet of leased, or owned, interior or exterior space to the total square feet within the development of interior, or exterior, space available for occupancy.
(c)
The customer of the stormwater utility shall be billed for the stormwater user fee charges. The stormwater user fee charge may be billed on a common statement and collected along with other city public utility charges. The customer may be the occupant, owner or user who is billed by the city for public services (i.e., water, sewer, electricity, sanitation, and/or cable services). If the developed land does not receive any other city public utility services, or is not being charged for public utility services due to vacancy, or non-use, at the time of stormwater user fee billing, then the owner of the property shall be billed for stormwater management services by the city. Regardless of whether or not the developed land has an occupant or user, the owner is ultimately responsible for payment of the stormwater user fee charges.
(Ord. No. 2005-10, ยง 1(25-81), 5-16-2005)
Sec. 65-202. - SameโBilling, delinquencies, collections.
(a)
Failure to receive a stormwater user fee bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records of the county, shall be ultimately obligated to pay such stormwater user fee charge. If a customer or owner is under billed, or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may back bill the customer for a period of up to three years, subject to the penalties for such delinquency set forth in section 59-1. The stormwater user fee may be included in the bill for other city utilities as set forth in section 59-1.
(b)
Unpaid stormwater user fee charges shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account by using all methods allowed by state law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. In no instance shall the unpaid stormwater user fee charge constitute a direct lien against the property.
(Ord. No. 2005-10, ยง 1(25-82), 5-16-2005)
Sec. 65-203. - Appeals.
Any person who can show that the impervious surface allocated to such person's property is in error may appeal in the following manner:
(1)
An appeal shall be filed in writing with the city administrator using the process outlined in this section. The initial appeal can be undertaken by having the customer request that the city review the customer account data to confirm the accuracy of the customer's bill. If the customer account data does not indicate an error, the customer can present a detailed survey of the parcel, the associated impervious surface data and any other features or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events and stormwater runoff. The survey shall be prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer.
(2)
Using the information provided by the appellant, the city administrator may conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and respond to the appeal in writing within 60 days.
(3)
In response to an appeal, the city administrator may adjust the stormwater user fee charge applicable to the property in conformance with the general purpose and intent of this article.
(4)
There shall be no further administrative appeal beyond the city administrator.
