DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 65-56. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-construction stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-construction stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. Additionally, the city is required to comply with several state and federal laws, regulations and permits and the requirements of the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District's regional water plan related to managing the water quantity, velocity, and quality of post-construction stormwater runoff.

Footnotes:
--- (4) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2022-238 , § 8, adopted May 23, 2022, amended the title of div. 3 to read as herein set out. The former div. 3 title pertained to postdevelopment stormwater management performance criteria.

Sec. 65-111. - Applicability.
The performance criteria in this division shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article.
(Ord. No. 2003-20, § 4, 2-24-2003)
Sec. 65-112. - Water quality.
All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
(1)
It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual;
(2)
Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and
(3)
Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices.
(Ord. No. 2003-20, § 4.1, 2-24-2003)
Sec. 65-113. - Stream channel protection.
Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
(1)
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer.
(2)
Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event.
(3)
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.

Sec. 65-114. - Overbank flooding protection.
Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-construction peak discharge rate to the predevelopment rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under section 65-113 is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. This requirement shall not apply for sites where the post-construction downstream analysis, acceptable to the city, shows that uncontrolled post-construction conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-construction conditions.
(Ord. No. 2003-20, § 4.3, 2-24-2003; Ord. No. 2022-238 , § 9, 5-23-2022)
Sec. 65-115. - Extreme flooding protection.
Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. This requirement shall not apply for sites where the post-development downstream analysis, acceptable to the city, shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions.
(Ord. No. 2003-20, § 4.4, 2-24-2003)
Sec. 65-116. - Structural stormwater controls.
(a)
All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased non-point source pollution loads created on the site in question.
(b)
Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control.
(Ord. No. 2003-20, § 4.5, 2-24-2003)
Sec. 65-117. - Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures.
The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under section 65-112. The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements that identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.
