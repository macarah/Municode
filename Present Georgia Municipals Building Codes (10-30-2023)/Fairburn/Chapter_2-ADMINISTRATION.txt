The 60-day period provided for in this section shall begin to run from the time an action has been taken by the governing body's investigating committee to forward the complaint to the board of ethics or, in such cases where it is required, the date on which the governing authority has appointed special legal counsel for the board, whichever event occurs last.

(k)
Penalties and additional rights of parties.
(1)
Any city official who knowingly violates any provision of the code of ethics shall be subject to public reprimand, censure, or removal from office by the city governing authority; provided, however, that no member of the governing authority shall be removed from office except upon impeachment and trial pursuant to section 2-60 of this Code.
(2)
Before any evidentiary hearing held by the board of ethics, the city official who is the subject of inquiry shall have the right to written notice of the allegations at least ten business days before the hearing.
(3)
Whenever a city official has been charged in a complaint with a violation of this section while acting in their official capacity and the final determination of the board of ethics is that no such violation occurred, such city official may, in accordance with Georgia law, petition the governing authority for reimbursement of reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the city official in defense of the allegations.
(4)
In any case where, in addition to finding that no violation of this section occurred, the board, by an additional special finding, determines, after an evidentiary hearing, that the complaint was based on patently false assertions or was otherwise filed for malicious reasons, the governing authority may take such action against the complainant as within its authority to do so; including, public reprimand, censure, removal from office, or the referral of the matter to other authorities.
(l)
Appeals. Any city official adversely affected by the findings of the board of ethics and who is disciplined in accordance with this section by the city governing authority may obtain judicial review by filing an application for a writ of certiorari in the Superior Court of Fulton County within 30 days after the board's decision. The filing of such application shall act as supersedes.
