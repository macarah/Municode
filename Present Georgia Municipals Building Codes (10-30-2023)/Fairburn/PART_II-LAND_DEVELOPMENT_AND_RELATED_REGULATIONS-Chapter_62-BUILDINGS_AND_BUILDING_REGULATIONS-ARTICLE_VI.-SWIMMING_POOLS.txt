Sec. 62-214. - Regulations and specifications.
All private and public pools and pool areas within the city shall be constructed and maintained in conformance with the standard codes adopted by the city pursuant to section 62-1 and with any other applicable provisions of this Code and state or county law.
(Code 1966, § 12-1; Ord. of 8-11-1947, § 125; Ord. No. 92-02, § 5, 2-24-1992)
Sec. 62-215. - Permits for and maintenance of public swimming pools.
With regard to the operation of public pools only:
(1)
All swimming pools and bathing places operated and maintained for use by the public shall obtain an annual permit from the county health officer, which permit must be presented to the city clerk before a license to operate the same will be granted. The permit may at any time be revoked at the discretion of the county health officer, for good and sufficient reasons.
(2)
Where an insufficient amount of fresh water is added, satisfactory means of chemical treatment for the purification of the water must be provided and samples of the water tested at such intervals as the county health officer may deem necessary. If and when samples fail to meet the bacterial quality for swimming pool waters in section 62-216, the same shall constitute good and sufficient reasons for the revocation of the permit.
(Code 1966, § 12-1; Ord. of 8-11-1947, § 125; Ord. No. 92-02, § 5, 2-24-1992)
Sec. 62-216. - Bacterial quality for swimming pool waters.
(a)
Bacteria count. Not more than ten percent of samples covering any four consecutive sampling intervals shall contain more than 200 bacteria per cc.
(b)
Partial B. Coli confirmed test. Not more than two out of five samples collected on the same day or not more than three out of any ten consecutive samples collected on different dates shall show positive B. Coli tests in ten cc. of the water at times when the pool is in use.
(c)
Procedure of analysis. The collection of all samples and all chemical and bacterial analyses shall be made in accordance with the procedures recommended in the Standard Methods of Water Analysis of the American Public Health Association insofar as these methods are applicable to swimming pool waters.
(Code 1966, § 21-2; Ord. of 8-11-1947, § 126)
Sec. 62-217. - Bathing load limits.
(a)
Frequency of changing water. The total number of bathers using a swimming pool during any period of time shall not exceed 20 persons for each 1,000 gallons of clean water added to the pool during that period. The term "clean water" means:
(1)
New, clean water used to refill the pool;
(2)
New, clean water used to replace loss by splashing or during cleaning;
(3)
Water taken from the pool and returned after effective filtration and chlorination; or
(4)
Any combination of such waters.
Branch or creek water shall not be permitted to enter the pool unless the same has been effectively filtrated and disinfected.
(b)
Frequency of disinfection. At any pool where the addition of disinfectant is not continuous during the bathing period, the total number of persons permitted to use the pool between any two consecutive disinfections shall not exceed seven persons for each 1,000 gallons of water in the pool and each disinfection shall be sufficient to ensure that the bacterial quality of the water shall conform to the limits stated in section 62-216.
(Code 1966, § 21-3; Ord. of 8-11-1947, § 127)
Sec. 62-218. - Operation and control.
(a)
Supervision of bathers. A swimming instructor, bathing master or lifeguard shall be on duty at the poolside at all times when a pool is open to use by bathers. Any such attendants shall be capable swimmers, competent in life saving methods of artificial resuscitation. Such attendant shall have full charge of bathing and have authority to enforce all rules of safety and sanitation.
(b)
Personal regulations.
(1)
Showers shall be provided and all bathers shall be required to take a cleansing shower bath in the nude before entering the pool.
(2)
Any person having any skin disease, sore or inflamed eyes, cold, nasal or ear discharges, infectious sores, or any communicable disease shall be excluded from any public swimming pool.
(c)
Bathing suits, towels, etc. All bathing suits and towels issued for public use laundered in a public laundry shall be washed with soap and boiled and thoroughly dried each time they are used. Clean suits and towels must be kept strictly separated from those that have been used and unlaundered.
(d)
Record. Every pool operator shall obtain blank forms from the county health department and shall record every day:
(1)
The capacity of the pool in gallons;
(2)
The number of persons using the pool during the day;
(3)
The maximum number of persons using the pool at any one time;
(4)
The volume of new, clean water added;
(5)
Where and how new, clean water is obtained;

Amount and brand of disinfectant used;
(7)
If continuous or intermittent dosages;

Date and time of intermittent dosage;
(9)
The pH of the water and the available or excess chlorine content.
A copy of all daily records shall be mailed to the county health department each week the pool is in operation.

Excess chlorine. The excess chlorine in the water at any time the pool is in use shall not be less than 0.2 parts per million.
(Code 1966, § 21-4; Ord. of 8-11-1947, § 128)
Sec. 62-219. - Laboratory equipment.
Each pool where disinfectants are used shall have sufficient and proper equipment for the determination of the pH (acidity or alkalinity) and an orthotolidine test for excess chlorine. In lieu thereof, the pool operator may provide for daily tests by commercial chemists.

Sec. 62-220. - New pools.

(Code 1966, § 21-6; Ord. of 8-11-1947, § 130)
Sec. 62-221. - Violations; revocation of permit.
Whenever it shall come to the attention of the health department that a violation of any of the provisions of this article exists at any swimming pool, such violation shall be called to the attention of the operator and unless the same is corrected within a reasonable time, the permit for said pool shall be revoked. Pending the correction of said violation, the health officer, should he deem it necessary, may order operation of said pool suspended.
