Sec. 59-139. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
BOD5 (denoting biochemical oxygen demand) means the quantity of oxygen utilized in the biochemical oxidation of organic matter under standard laboratory procedure in five days at 20 degrees centigrade, expressed in milligrams per liter.
Building drain means that part of the lowest horizontal piping of a drainage system carrying sewage that receives discharge from soil, waste and other drainage pipes inside the walls of the building and conveys it to the building's sewer.
Building sewer (sometimes called house lateral) means the extension from the building drain to the public sewer or other place of disposal.
Chemical oxygen demand (COD): A measure of the oxygen reducing capabilities of wastewater due to chemical reactions. Wastewater with inorganic material (such as chemicals from household cleaners and detergents) can cause chemical reactions that absorb oxygen. If large quantities of these chemicals enter wastewater, chemical reactions occur which consume large amounts of oxygen. If the oxygen level in the water drops too much, fish and other aquatic life may not survive. POTWs can only treat small quantities of COD in wastewater. If COD levels become too high, the wastewater may pass through the POTW only partially treated thus endangering aquatic life in water.
Commercial-industrial wastes: Any and all other wastes not being domestic wastes but not limited to the wastes from commercial, laboratory and industrial processes, wastes from domestic operations or certain trade operations such as sand, grit, waste petroleum products from automotive service stations, and the like, animal wastes, straw and related items from dairy or other farming operations.

For purposes of this manual, a grease trap is a small, indoor device.
Industrial user: A source of discharge, which introduces pollutants into the publicly-owned treatment works from any non-domestic source.
Liquid waste hauler: Any person, firm, corporation or other entity that collects, pumps, transports and/or disposes of liquid wastes.
Local limit: A maximum pollutant level placed on wastewater discharged to the city sewer. These local limits are listed in the sewer use ordinance or a permit issued directly to the source that are required to meet all local limits. Cities and towns may impose special local limits on food providers for pollutants such as oil and grease, BOD, and TSS.
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES): The national system for the issuance of permits under Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972.

Public sewer means a sewer that is controlled by the city.
Residential use shall apply to any property that is zoned in the city or county for a residential use, unless the property is being put to a commercial use.
Sanitary sewer means a pipe or conduit that carries sewage and to which stormwaters, surface waters and groundwaters are not intentionally admitted.
Sanitary Sewer Overflow (SSO): Overflow of a city sewer often due to a blockage in a line. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that up to 80 percent of SSOs are caused by oil and grease blockages. Sanitary sewer overflows often result in the release of many thousands of gallons of untreated wastewater.

(j)
When required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the sewer, to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manholes, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
(k)
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with those test procedures for analysis of pollutants which are cited and described in 40 CFR 136 of the Federal Register, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.)
(l)
Persons wishing to discharge wastewaters to the city's sanitary sewerage system in amounts exceeding the volume of water purchased from the city, must receive written permission from the city before discharging the excess amounts. The city shall require the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish the volume of wastewater discharged. The corrected metered flow will be used for sewerage billing. All such additional facilities shall be provided by the owner of the premises concerned at no expense to the city.
(m)
Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the city that a portion greater than 50 percent of the water purchased as measured by the water meter or meters does not enter the sanitary sewerage system, the city may require or shall permit the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish that portion which does enter the sanitary sewerage system, and the corrected metered flow will be used for sewerage billing. All such additional facilities shall be provided by the owner of the premises concerned or other interested parties at no expense to the city.
(n)
No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial concern.
(o)
Where BOD and/or suspended solids in excess of normal concentration are found to be compatible with the sewerage system by the city, the persons discharging such wastes shall be charged and assessed a surcharge in addition to any sewer service charges. Normal concentrations for these constituents are defined as follows:
(1)
A five-day, 20-degree Centigrade biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 250 milligrams per liter as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with subsection (k) of this section.
(2)
A suspended solids content of 300 milligrams per liter as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with subsection (k) of this section.
The amount of such surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the city in handling the excess constituents to include but not be limited to operation and maintenance, administration, depreciation, amortization and other expenses attributable to the sewerage system.
(p)
All new and existing food service establishments as well as multi-residential complexes and other program participants are required to comply with the City of Fairburn Grease Management (FOG Control Program) Policies and Procedures Manual most recently adopted by the city council. The Grease Management (FOG Control Program) Policies and Procedures Manual may be amended by appropriate city departments from time to time. The purpose of the program is to reduce discharges of fats, oil and grease from program participants into the wastewater collection system in order to reduce and prevent sewer system overflows. All program participants will be periodically inspected by the city to ensure compliance with the program requirements. The city will establish a monthly fee which will be added to program participant's sewer bills to recover the cost of the program. The fee will be included in the city's fee schedule. No fee shall be charged to any FSE that prepares, on average, less than ten full meals per month. An annual commercial waste permit will be required for all pretreatment systems existing and new. The permit fee is based on the type of pretreatment system at the facility. All commercial waste permits shall be issued annually from January 1 thru March 31. An existing facility obtaining a permit after March 31 will be charged a 25 percent penalty fee. A new facility opening after the annual permit period will not pay a penalty unless it has been determined by the city that the facility has been opened for more than 30 days. There will be no prorated fee for a new facility applying for a commercial waste permit after the permitting period. The fee will be included in the city's fee schedule.

Malfunctioning system is an on-site sewage management system that permits sewage to discharge or flow from it into any storm, drain, stream, water body, gutter, street, roadway, or public place, or if sewage discharges from the system to the surface or subsurface of any property so as to create a nuisance or a condition detrimental to health. Substantial backflow from the leaching area (absorption lines) into the tank during a tank pump-out shall also be considered an indication of a malfunctioning system as determined by a registered and certified service person employed by a septic system service company registered with the county.
On-site sewage management system means a sewage management system other than a publicly owned and maintained sewage treatment system serving one or more buildings, mobile homes, recreational vehicles, residences, or other facilities designed or used for human occupancy or congregation. The term "on-site sewage management system" shall include, without limitation, conventional and chamber septic tank systems, privies, and experimental and alternative on-site management systems that are designed to be physically incapable of a surface discharge of effluent that may be approved by the state division of public health.
Septic tank means an approved watertight tank designed or used to receive sewage from a building sewer and to effect separation and organic decomposition of sewage solids, and discharging sewage effluent to an absorption field or other management system.

Septic tank and absorption field and line inspection, maintenance service, pump-out and repairs shall be conducted by a septic tank contractor and service personnel certified by the state and registered with the county health department.
(4)
Property owners who install, or inspect and service, their septic tanks shall record their service history on the city's septic tank guide and maintenance record file or suitable alternative. Any qualifying certified service will establish the beginning of the five-year interval.
(5)
Upon completion of the installation, required inspection, maintenance, and any necessary repair to the septic system, the contractor shall certify that the work was conducted and completed in accordance with the accepted professional standards and practices and that the system is in property working order.

(e)
Malfunctioning systems.
(1)
An on-site sewage management system shall be deemed to be a malfunctioning system if sewage is allowed to discharge or flow from it onto the property, into any storm drain, stream, water body, gutter, street, roadway or public place, or if sewage discharges from the system to the surface or subsurface of any property so as to create a nuisance or a condition detrimental to health. Substantial backflow from the leaching area (absorption lines or field lines) into the tank during a tank pump-out shall also be considered an indication of a malfunctioning system as determined by a registered and certified service person employed by a septic system service company registered with the county.
(2)
In addition, any and all parts of a septic system that are found by a registered and certified service person employed by a septic system service company registered with the county to be damaged, misaligned, or missing (such as, but not limited to, a cracked lid, missing "T," or misaligned outflow line) shall constitute a malfunctioning system.
(3)
Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, all property owners with septic systems or other approved on-site sewage management systems shall be responsible for correcting the malfunctioning of such systems within 30 days from receipt of written notification, which notice shall communicate the specifics of the malfunction. Reporting of repairs shall be consistent with subsection (b) of this section.
(f)
Basis for extensions. Extensions to modify the five-year reporting and servicing requirement as specified in subsection (b) of this section may be granted under the following conditions:
(1)
The owner of a septic system may required an administrative extension, demonstrating unusual hardship and unique circumstantial basis for approval. If the request indicates that the septic system can be serviced at an interval longer than five years, and the owner certifies the information submitted with the request is accurate, then the extension may be submitted for approval by the city administrator. Extensions are valid for a period of one year, subject to renewal upon requalification.
(2)

If the utility does not commence such replacement or repair after 20 working days following written notice from the city, the city or the owner of the affected structure or property may make such replacement or repair and the utility shall pay the reasonable and actual cost of the same.
(b)
Whenever it is necessary to replace or relocate a joint use pole:
(1)
The city shall give reasonable notice thereof in writing (except in the case of an emergency, when verbal notice will be given and subsequently confirmed in writing) to the utility, specifying in such notice the time of such proposed replacement or relocation, and the utility shall at the time so specified transfer its attachments to the new or relocated joint pole; or
(2)
In the alternative, the city shall give to the utility such reasonable notice as mutually agreed upon by the parties, specifying the time of such proposed replacement or relocation, and the utility shall at the time so specified transfer its attachments to the new or relocated joint pole. The electric notification system of pole transfer requests, provided by the National Joint Utilities Notification System (the "NJUNS"), may be used as the notification required by this article. As a prerequisite for use of this system, both parties shall have and utilize the necessary electronic equipment required by the NJUNS.
(c)
Utility attachments shall be promptly transferred from abandoned poles to new poles and as required by applicable permits and agreements. In the event that a utility does not within 30 days following proper notification, either in writing or through the NJUNS, remove its abandoned facilities or transfer its attachments to a new pole, the city will have the following rights, in addition to any other rights and remedies available under this article:
(1)
The city may perform the required work and the utility shall pay the costs of the same; or
(2)
Should the city elect not to perform the work on behalf of the utility, the utility shall be charged a fee of $10.00 per month per pole or other equipment, beginning on the 61st day after the utility has been properly notified, and shall also be charged the costs incurred to return to the job site to remove the old pole. The monthly fee shall continue to be charged until the city has been given proper notification, in writing or through the NJUNS, that such transfer has been made. In the event the utility notifies the city that the transfer has been completed, and the city returns to the job site and discovers that the transfer has not been made, the utility shall pay the city's costs of the trip to and from the job site. The intent of this paragraph is to ensure timely transfers and minimize situations of two or more poles needlessly remaining at the same location for extended periods of time.

When a third-party is to perform the inventory, the city shall have sole discretion in the contractor selected for this work. The cost of such inventory shall be shared equally among the city and the utilities attached to city-owned poles. If any difference in the number of jointly used poles is found between the actual physical inventory and the previous inventory adjusted by any attachments added or attachments removed since the last inventory, the differential will be prorated as if the subject attachments were placed in equal numbers over the years that have elapsed since the prior inventory and shall be billed and paid at the then appropriate rate in effect.
