The ordinance from which this article is derived is adopted in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and of the general public by regulating the location, design, operation and maintenance of festivals.

Sec. 14-95. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Festival means a specific outdoor public celebration or gathering for which a license or permit has been issued by the city which involves the use either of public parks or public streets and which includes entertainment, dancing, music, dramatic productions, art exhibition, parades, or the sale of merchandise, food or beverages, or any combination of the foregoing; and which of necessity requires for its successful execution the provision and coordination of municipal services to a degree significantly over and above that which the city routinely provides under ordinary everyday circumstances. The term "festival" does not include events that are solely parades, footraces or political demonstrations unless such parade, footrace or political demonstration is proposed as an integral part of a larger festival.
