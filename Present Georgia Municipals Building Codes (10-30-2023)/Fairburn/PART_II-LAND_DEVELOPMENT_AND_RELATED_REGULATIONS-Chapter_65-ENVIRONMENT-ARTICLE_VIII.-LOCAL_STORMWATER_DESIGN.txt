DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 65-325. - Purpose and intent.

DIVISION 2. - GENERAL LEVEL OF SERVICE STANDARDS

Sec. 65-354. - Detention requirements.
(a)
Discharge rates—From new development projects.
(1)
Development plans including site grading and drainage plans should be developed to minimize disruption of natural drainage patterns on properties. Additionally, no increases in stormwater runoff rates shall be allowed at any discharge point on the site. The baseline (predeveloped) conditions shall be a wooded undisturbed site regardless of whether any clearing has occurred in the past and shall model any depression storage and/or detention storage. The development shall be analyzed for the following storm events:
a.
2-year 24-hour design storm.
b.
5-year 24-hour design storm.
c.
10-year 24-hour design storm.
d.
25-year 24-hour design storm.
e.
50-year 24-hour design storm.
f.
100-year 24-hour design storm.
(2)
If the total area of the site (i.e., total property area) and the drainage area to each stormwater management facility is less than one acre, then a rainfall intensity based analysis (i.e., rational method) may be performed. If detention facilities are to be designed and constructed in series, the 24-hour storm criteria will apply regardless of the drainage area.
(b)
Same—From redevelopment projects.
(1)
Development plans including site grading and drainage plans should be developed to minimize disruption of natural drainage patterns on properties. Additionally, no increases in stormwater runoff rates shall be allowed at any discharge point on the site. The baseline conditions shall be based on an analysis of the stormwater discharge rates from the site in its existing condition and shall model any depression storage and/or detention storage. The development shall be analyzed for the following storm events:
a.
2-year 24-hour design storm.
b.
5-year 24-hour design storm.
c.
10-year 24-hour design storm.
d.
25-year 24-hour design storm.
e.
50-year 24-hour design storm.
f.
100-year 24-hour design storm.
(2)
If the total area of the site (i.e., total property area) and the drainage area to each stormwater management facility is less than one acre, then a rainfall intensity based analysis (i.e., rational method) may be performed. If detention facilities are to be designed and constructed in series, the 24-hour storm criteria will apply regardless of the drainage area.
