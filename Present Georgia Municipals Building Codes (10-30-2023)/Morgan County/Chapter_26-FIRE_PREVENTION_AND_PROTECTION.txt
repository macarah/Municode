To prepare and defend budget submissions to the board of commissioners for the volunteer companies/departments.

ARTICLE IV. - HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Sec. 26-50. - Purpose.
Due to the extraordinary costs associated with the mitigation of a hazardous materials incident, Morgan County shall hereby bill the responsible party for recovering costs associated with the emergency response of the fire and rescue department, as well as any third-party contractor hired by the county to respond to such hazardous materials incidents.
(Ord. No. 2016-001, § 1(exh. A), 8-16-2016)
Sec. 26-51. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Hazardous material incident means a release or spill of any material considered to be dangerous to the general public or the environment (as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency, Georgia Department of Natural Resources, and the Georgia State Fire Prevention Code).
Responsible party means any manufacturer, owner, shipper or otherwise possessor of hazardous materials, who is responsible for the safe transport, storage and/or use of hazardous materials.
(Ord. No. 2016-001, § 1(exh. A), 8-16-2016)
Sec. 26-52. - Policy.
Morgan County recognizes the need for emergency hazardous materials response within the jurisdictional limits of Morgan County. Therefore, no person, agency or entity requiring an emergency hazardous materials response shall be denied those services due to a lack of insurance coverage or the inability to pay for those services. Morgan County provides emergency hazardous materials response only, and does not act as a cleanup contractor, and does not provide cleanup or disposal services. However, if Morgan County hires a contractor to clean up a hazardous material incident, it has the right to charge the responsible party for the costs charged by the contractor. Any applicable services rendered to a person, agency or entity shall be billed to that person, agency or entity. The emergency management director, with approval of the county manager, may waive reimbursement in instances where only minimal response services were required. Other emergency response agencies assisting the fire department may submit their list of expenses to the emergency management director for inclusion in the bill submitted to the responsible party. Neither Morgan County, nor its fire department, shall accept any liability for payment of such costs incurred by other emergency response agencies.
(Ord. No. 2016-001, § 1(exh. A), 8-16-2016)
Sec. 26-53. - Procedure.
(a)
A detailed listing of hazardous materials response services provided to persons, entities, and/or agencies will be compiled by the emergency management director. This information will be forwarded to the Morgan County Finance Department, which shall be responsible for the billing.
(b)
The responsible party shall reimburse Morgan County for its costs for subsistence supplies and for its costs to replace or repair all equipment, vehicles, instruments, clothing, supplies and other items damaged or lost in the mitigation of a hazardous materials incident.
(c)
The responsible party shall be required to reimburse Morgan County for the actual cost of personnel needed in the response.
(d)
The responsible party shall be required to reimburse Morgan County for the use of apparatus needed in the response based on the Federal Emergency Management Agency Schedule of Equipment for like or similar equipment.
(e)
If Morgan County hired a third-party contractor to perform any hazardous material incident cleanup or remediation, the responsible party shall reimburse the county for the third-party contractor's charges.
(f)
If a responsible party fails to fully reimburse Morgan County for any amounts owed pursuant to this section within 30 days of a demand for payment, the county may institute an action to recover such costs, in which instance, the responsible party shall be responsible for Morgan County's reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation.
