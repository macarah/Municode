Whenever the board of commissioners shall reasonably determine that any pipe, main, conduit, cable, wire, pole, tower, or other signal or equipment, facilities or appliances of any utility in, on, along, over or under the public roads of the county should be removed or relocated, because it has become an obstruction or interference with the use and/or safe operation of a county road, or will become an obstruction or interference with the use and/or safe operation of a proposed county road, a written notice shall be directed to the utility company, giving at least 60 days' notice to the utility to make such change as is necessary for removal or relocations as may be necessary in the county's reasonable discretion. If the utility does not thereafter begin removal within a reasonable time sufficient to allow for engineering and other procedures reasonably necessary for the removal and relocation of the utility facility, the board of commissioners may give the utility a final notice directing that such removal shall commence not later than ten days from receipt of such final notice. If such removal has not begun within that ten days or if such removal has begun and the relocation has not been completed within 45 days thereof, the board of commissioners may remove or relocate the same with its own employees, or by contracted labor, tools, equipment, supervision, or other necessary services and materials and whatever else is necessary to accomplish the removal or relocation, and the expense thereof shall be charged to the utility.
