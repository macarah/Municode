When a need for a towing vehicle arises, and the owner/operator of the stranded vehicle has no preference as to which licensee is used, the towing service next on the 911 center's towing list will generally be used.
(b)
A request for a specified licensee by the owner/operator of a stranded vehicle must be made on an individual incident basis. Advance blanket requests are not practical for safety and efficiency, and therefore will not be honored.
(c)
If the use of the requested licensee would result in an excessive delay to the officer in the execution of his or her duties, the officer may exercise the option of using another licensee on the 911 center's towing list.
(d)
In a towing emergency situation involving significant threat to life or property, the officer may utilize the closest equipment or services necessary to stabilize the situation.
(e)
It will be the responsibility of the towing driver to ensure that all safety equipment, such as chains or cables, are used in accordance with state and federal laws, rules and regulations, as well as the manufacturer's requirements, and as designed for the safe and legal operation of recovery vehicles.
(f)
No towing service is allowed to utilize a nonconsensual service call to solicit business.
(g)
If the licensee is unable to promptly respond to the initial call, the 911 center will generally contact the next licensee on the list.
(h)
The 911 center may survey its territories and attempt to locate towing services that can provide resources beyond normal services proved by licensee, i.e., larger wreckers and specialized equipment. If more than one service wishes to participate in providing the same type services, the 911 center may establish a list of those requests to be maintained.

ARTICLE IV. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS[1]

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. of June 5, 2007, § 1, amended Article IV in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Article IV pertained to similar subject matter. See also the Code Comparative Table.
State Law reference— County governing authority has power to enact legislation to restrict operation of adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, and adult movie houses to areas zoned for commercial or industrial purposes, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3.

Sec. 18-105. - Findings; public purposes.
(a)
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, and on the experiences of the county, which experiences we believe are relevant to the problem faced by the county, we take note of the conditions and occurrences generally associated with adult entertainment establishments. It is the finding of the board of commissioners that adult entertainment establishments, particularly those where alcoholic beverages are served, result in an increase in criminal behavior and create undesirable community conditions. An increase in instances of disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, prostitution, drug trafficking and loitering of individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other counties and municipalities which permit adult entertainment establishments, particularly those in which alcoholic beverages are served.
(b)
The board of commissioners and sheriff have carefully reviewed relevant portions of voluminous documentation, including without limitation information from the December, 1994 St. Cloud Adult Use Regulation Report, a detailed 18 page report from Dr. Richard McCleary in the 2005 case involving Starship Enterprise of Atlanta Inc. v. Fulton County and others, a 26 page report from Dr. Richard McCleary in the 2005 case of Reliable Consultants Inc. v. City of Kennedale, Texas, a detailed April, 1997 report from appraiser Peter Malin to the City of Dallas city attorney, and certain documentation from a 2002 criminal case involving the State of Tennessee and various individuals regarding an adult entertainment business in Chattanooga, Tennessee. All this documentation reviewed by the board of commissioners and sheriff is being attached to the minutes of the meeting approving this ordinance, and is officially made a part of the record. The board of commissioners also recognizes that courts have made findings in these issues, and the board relies on its collective wisdom and common sense. The board further relies on the evidentiary foundation set forth in City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 120 S.Ct. 1382, 146 L.Ed.2d 265, (2000), and in Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 106 S.Ct. 925 to the effect that secondary effects are caused by the presence of even one adult entertainment establishment in a given neighborhood.
(c)
An increase in instances of disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, public indecency, public solicitation, violent crime, prostitution, exploitation of young women, drug use, drug trafficking and loitering of individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other counties and municipalities that permit adult entertainment establishments, particularly where there are two or more such businesses in close proximity, and particularly in such businesses that serve alcohol. The board of commissioners has a substantial interest in guarding against these undesirable secondary effects, to protect the public health, safety and welfare and to preserve and protect the quality of life in the county. The board of commissioners also wishes to guard against public indecency which is a crime per O.C.G.A. § 16-6-8, and to guard against certain sexual contact provided for money, which is a crime per O.C.G.A. § 16-6-16.
(d)
The board of commissioners also finds that the increase in criminal behavior which accompanies adult entertainment establishments causes undesirable community conditions, particularly where there are two or more such businesses in close proximity, and particularly in such businesses that serve alcohol. Conditions experienced in other counties and municipalities are: depression of property values in neighborhoods surrounding the adult entertainment establishment, neighborhood blight, an increased burden on and expenditure for law enforcement, and an increase in the criminal case load in the judicial system due to a greater number of arrests because of the above mentioned crime problems. The board of commissioners notes a substantial governmental interest in regulating this and any atmosphere conducive to violence, sexual harassment, public intoxication, prostitution, spread of sexually transmitted diseases and other negative effects. The board of commissioners wishes to protect against neighborhood blight and downgrade of surrounding neighborhoods due to the problems and undesirable behavior associated with adult entertainment establishments.
(e)
The board of commissioners finds that the above-stated undesirable secondary effects will harm the county unless these regulations are imposed to limit such adverse affects. These regulations are to minimize the adverse effects in order to preserve quality of life and to protect the public health, safety, welfare and morals and to maintain the integrity of this community, especially in residential areas, and areas which have a church, school, daycare center, governmental building, library, civic center, public park or playground. These regulations are to promote these legitimate public and governmental interests in a way that will not infringe upon the constitutional right of freedom of expression. The board of commissioners is not attempting to preclude adult entertainment; rather, the board seeks to regulate adult entertainment establishments to protect the public from the above-described, negative secondary effects. The board of commissioners has narrowly tailored these regulations to combat the negative secondary effects and protect the public health, safety and welfare, while allowing reasonable avenues of protected first amendment communication. The board of commissioners has found no less-restrictive alternative to these regulations that would adequately protect the public health, safety and welfare. The restrictions posed by these regulations are no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the government interest stated above.
(f)
Therefore, the purpose of this article is to regulate adult entertainment establishments to prevent increases in criminal activity and undesirable community conditions. It is recognized that such regulation cannot approach prohibition, or a protected form of expression would vanish. Therefore, this article represents an attempt to balance the competing interests of reduced criminal activity and neighborhood protection versus the rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

GARAGE SALES, FLEA MARKETS AND OTHER OUTDOOR SALES

Sec. 18-200. - Intent and purpose.
The Morgan County Board of Commissioners finds, determines and declares that:
A garage sale serves as a method by which a residential lessee or homeowner may sell or dispose of unwanted items of personal property and correspondingly provides an opportunity for other persons to purchase bargains;
The unregulated allowance of garage sales in the unincorporated areas of Morgan County presents an opportunity for abuse in that some persons may be conducting business activities under the guise of having a garage sale;
The existence of non-regulated and recurring garage sales and flea markets causes annoyance to citizens in the unincorporated areas of Morgan County and congestion of the state and local roads;
This article is adopted for the purpose of prohibiting the encroachment of commercial activities into residential areas by regulating the term and frequency of garage sales and flea markets so as to prevent the disturbance or disruption of the residential environment throughout Morgan County;
This article is not intended to prohibit isolated or casual sales by individuals of household or other personal items; and
The provisions and prohibitions contained in this article are adopted not for the purpose of preventing, but for the purpose of regulating the garage sales and flea markets in the unincorporated areas of Morgan County for the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the county.
