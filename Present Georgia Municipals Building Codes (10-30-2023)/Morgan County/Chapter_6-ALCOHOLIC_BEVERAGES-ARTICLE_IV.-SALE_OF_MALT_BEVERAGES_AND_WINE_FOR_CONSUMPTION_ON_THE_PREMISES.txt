Sec. 6-356. - Reports.
(a)
Each licensee under this section shall, as a condition of maintaining such license, file with the clerk within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter:
(1)
A sworn statement of the licensee's sales during the preceding calendar quarter on forms approved by the county. The forms for such quarterly verified statements shall reflect the licensee's gross dollar sales amount for total sales for the applicable calendar quarter, the gross dollar sales amount for malt beverages and wine for the applicable calendar quarter, and gross dollar sales amount for food items for the applicable calendar quarter.
(2)
Certified copies of the licensee's state department of revenue sales and use tax monthly reports as filed with the state department of revenue for each month during the respective calendar quarter.
(b)
Any sale of a food or beverage containing any malt beverage and/or wine shall be deemed to be a sale solely of a malt beverage and/or wine, and such sale shall not be included as a food sale in the quarterly reports. The fact that the sale of food during any calendar quarter exceeds by three times the sales of malt beverages and/or wine shall not be conclusive that the licensee is meeting the requirements of operating a restaurant as defined in this chapter.

The quarterly statements shall be confidential in nature and shall not be open for public inspection except as otherwise required by law. Said forms shall be used solely by the county manager for determination of whether or not the licensee remains qualified to hold a pouring license.
