Sec. 22-76. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses generally known as and defined herein as adult entertainment establishments. To that end this article has been enacted in the interests of:
(1)
Promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the city; and
(2)
Preserving the quality of life in residential and business areas of the city; and
(3)
Promoting desirable living conditions and sustaining the stability of residential and commercial property values. This article is intended to reasonably regulate adult entertainment establishments and businesses in order to serve the legitimate governmental interests set out herein.
(Ord. of 11-11-96, § 1)
Sec. 22-77. - Legislative findings of fact.
Based upon the results of an investigation and the attendant evidence produced, the council finds that:
(1)
The outright prohibition of adult entertainment establishments improperly infringes upon protected forms of expression; but that reasonable regulation of such businesses so as to curtail and prevent pernicious secondary effects is both permissible and desirable.
(2)
Adult entertainment establishments and businesses, if unregulated, are likely to lead to an increase in illegal sexual activities, drug and alcohol offenses, disorderly conduct and other criminal activity.
(3)
Law enforcement resources available for responding to problems associated with or created by adult entertainment establishments and businesses are extremely limited due to the growth of the city and county and such resources are best conserved by regulating and licensing adult entertainment establishments.
(4)
The public health, safety, welfare and convenience of the residents of the city require that adult entertainment businesses and establishments and their locations, operations, employees and owners be regulated and licensed in order to reduce the potential for harm and in order to preserve and protect the quality of life in the residential and business environs of the city.
(5)
The location of adult entertainment establishments and businesses in close proximity to each other adversely affects the property values, causes an increase in crime, and encourages residents and other businesses in proximity to such adult entertainment establishments to move and locate elsewhere.
(6)
There is presently in North Florida, and particularly in the Jacksonville area, and in Southeast Georgia an increasing trend toward nude and semi-nude acts, exhibitions and entertainment, and toward the utilization of nude and semi-nude employees engaged in other service-oriented activities and by adult entertainment establishments.
(7)
The commercial exploitation of nudity and semi-nudity consists of the use of nude and semi-nude entertainment in connection with or for the sale of goods or services, and the receipt of money by the person engaged in nude or semi-nude entertainment in exchange for or as consideration for a nude or semi-nude performance by such individual. Competitive commercial exploitation of nudity and semi-nudity is adverse to the public's interest in quality of life and commerce and the total community environment in the city and surrounding areas.
(8)
The commercial exploitation of nude and semi-nude conduct, acts, exhibitions and entertainment frequently occurs in commercial establishments either selling or allowing the consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises.
(9)
There is a direct relationship between the consumption of alcoholic beverages concurrently with nude and seminude activities, conduct and entertainment and an increase in criminal activities, disturbances of the peace and good order of the city and the concurrency of these activities is hazardous to the health and safety of those persons in attendance and tends to depreciate the value of adjoining property and harm the economic welfare of the community as a whole.
(10)
The combination of the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages with the performance of nude and semi-nude entertainment is inimical and adverse to the public's interest in the quality of life and commerce and quality of the environment of the city.
(11)
It is the duty and responsibility of the mayor and council for the city to protect and preserve the public health, safety, and welfare of the city and its residents, the stability of the value and use of property within the city, and the character of its neighborhoods and developments.
(12)
In order to preserve the public peace and good order, and to safeguard and protect the health, safety and welfare of the city and its citizens, it is necessary and advisable to prohibit nude and semi-nude acts, exhibitions and entertainment in commercial establishments at which alcoholic beverages are available, sold, or consumed.
(13)
In order to preserve the public peace and good order, and to safeguard and promote the health, safety and welfare of the city and its citizens, therefore, it is necessary and advisable to regulate and restrict the conduct of owners, operators, agents, employees, contractors, entertainers, performers, patrons, spectators, clientele and persons on the premises of adult entertainment establishments.
