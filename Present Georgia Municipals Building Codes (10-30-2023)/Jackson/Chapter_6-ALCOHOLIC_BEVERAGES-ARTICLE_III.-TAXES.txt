Sec. 6-87. - Determinations of deficiencies or in absence of return; overpayments; delinquency and fraud.
(a)
Recomputation of tax; authority to make; basis of recomputation. If the license department is not satisfied with the return or returns of the tax or the amount of the tax or the amount of the tax required to be paid to the city by any person, it may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of any information within its possession or that may be made of the amount due for one or more than one calendar month.
(b)
Estimate of gross receipts in absence of a return. If any licensee fails to make a return, the license department shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the licensee, or as the case may be, of the amount of the total sales in the city which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the licensee failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is or may come into the possession of the license department. Upon the basis of this estimate, the license department shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid to the city. One or more determinations may be made for one or for more than one period.
(c)
Offsetting of overpayments. In making a determination, the license department may offset overpayments, for a period or periods, against underpayments, for another period or periods, against penalties, and against the interest on underpayments. The interest on overpayments shall be computed in the manner set forth in section 6-90.
(d)
Time within which notice of deficiency determination shall be mailed. Promptly after making its determination the license department shall give to the person written notice to be served personally or by mail in the manner prescribed for service of notices in section 6-186. Except in the case of fraud, intent to evade this article or authorized rules or regulations, or failure to make a return, every notice of a deficiency determination shall be mailed within three years after the 20th day of the calendar month following the monthly period for which the amount is proposed to be determined, or within three years after the return is filed, whichever period should last expire.

Action for tax; time therefor. At any time within three years after any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected becomes due and payable, and at any time within three years after the delinquency of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected, the city may bring an action in the courts of the state, or of the United States, to collect the amount delinquent, together with penalties and interest, court fees, filing fees, attorneys' fees, costs of collection and other legal fees incident thereto.
(b)
Duty of successors or assignees of operator to withhold tax from purchase money. If any licensee liable for any amount under this article sells out his business or quits the business, his successors or assigns shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount due until the former owner produces a receipt from the license department showing that he has paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due.
(c)
Liability for failure to withhold; certificate of notice of amount due; time to enforce successor's liability. If the purchaser of a business fails to withhold the necessary amount from the purchase price as heretofore required, the purchaser becomes personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by it to the extent of the purchase price valued in money. Within 30 days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, the license department shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his address as it appears on the records of the city of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall begin at the time the licensee sells out his business or at the time that the determination against the licensee becomes final, whichever event occurs later.

If the licensee determines that it has overpaid or paid more than once, which fact has not been determined by the license department, it will have three years from the date of payment to file a claim in writing stating the specific ground upon which claim is founded. The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the city, the excess amount paid the city may be credited on amounts then due and payable from the licensee by whom it was paid or its administrators or executors.
