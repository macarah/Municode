modified
(a)
This section establishes an application fee for a wholesale license in the amount of $500.00. Once the application is approved, the new license fee for a wholesale license shall be $1,000.00 for any license issued with more than six months remaining in the calendar year. If a license is issued with fewer than six months remaining in a calendar year, the license fee shall be $500.00.
(b)
Each wholesale license shall be renewed every year by December 1st for the next calendar year. Any license renewed between December 2nd and December 31st shall pay a $200.00 penalty. Any license renewed within 60 days following December 31st shall pay an additional penalty of $100.00, for a total of $300.00 in penalty fees. Any license seeking renewal after the December 1 deadline, plus the December 31st penalty date, and the extended 60-day penalty date, shall no longer be a valid wholesale license and can only be reestablished with a new application and application fee, approval, and issuance of a new license.
(c)
If it is determined that a wholesale license holder has conducted businesses without a license, the annual fee will be owed to the city for every year the business operated without a license before any new license will be issued.
(d)
If any license holder continues to do business without a license, they shall be subject to all applicable local, state, and federal laws and penalties.
