5.
If a proposal does not meet the requirements of this Code, but the applicant believes that complying with the terms of this Code constitutes an undue hardship such that no practical or economic use remains for the property in question, taking into account all of the contiguous property under the owner's control, the applicant may apply for a variance pursuant to section 27-8.1.2.
6.
If a proposal does not meet the requirements of this Code, but the applicant believes that this is because the property should more appropriately be classified as a different character area, the applicant may apply for a Character Area Map (CAM) Amendment pursuant to section 27-8.1.3.
7.
If under the terms of this section, a proposal requires a special land use approval (SLUA), the applicant must submit an application for a SLUA pursuant to the terms of section 27-8.1.4.
(Res. No. 2022-20, 5-3-2022)
Sec. 27-8.1.2. - Variances.
1.
Certain provisions and requirements of the performance activity charts may create unnecessary hardships for property owners resulting from strict application of these provisions. No variances shall be considered for the requirements set by these regulations on conditional uses listed in article IV of this ordinance. In order to obtain the variance application from the planning department, the applicant must show all of the following:
A.
Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance.
i.
Hardship is determined on a case-by-case basis based on evidence presented to the planning commission.
ii.
The hardship must be more than mere inconvenience or a preference for a more lenient standard. Cost of compliance may be a factor, but cost is not determinative. It is not enough for an applicant to say that development will cost more in order to comply. The applicant must show the substantial and undue nature of that additional cost as compared to others subject to the same restriction.
B.
The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property.
i.
The unnecessary hardship must be peculiar to the property, not general to the neighborhood or community. Such peculiar characteristics might arise, for example, from location of the property, size or shape of the lot, or topography or water features on the site.
ii.
Hardships that result from personal circumstances may not be the basis for granting a variance. The planning commission considers the nature of the property and the land use ordinances, not the nature of the applicant and their circumstances.
iii.
The reverse is also true. An applicant's personal circumstances cannot be the basis for denying a variance. The fact that the applicant owns property nearby is irrelevant to the consideration of whether this particular property deserves a variance.
C.
The hardship is not a self-created hardship.
i.
The hardship must not result from actions taken by the applicant or property owner.
2.
Additionally, the variance applicant must show that the variance will:
A.
Be consistent with the intent of the ordinance;
B.
Secure public safety; and
C.
Achieve substantial justice.
3.
In such cases, property owners may submit an application for a variance from such specific requirements or provisions.
4.
An application for a variance to the provisions of this chapter can be obtained from the planning department. Variance applications shall be processed as either an administrative variance or general variance as described below.
A.
An application for variances shall be submitted on properly completed forms provided by the planning department.
B.
All information and supplemental materials requested by the forms shall be submitted in a timely manner.
C.
The planning department shall review the application for completeness of submission. Incomplete or improper applications will be returned to the applicant for resubmission.
D.
Any variance request that is not submitted as an administrative variance shall be considered by the planning commission as a general variance.
E.
Only one application for a general variance (of the same type) may be heard by the planning commission, for a property, every 12 months unless special approval is granted by the board of commissioners.
5.
Administrative variances shall be submitted to the planning department for review.
A.
Applications for an administrative variance may be reviewed and considered by the planning department if the application satisfies the following requirements:
I.
Any reductions in building setback requirements requested shall be less than 25 percent of the originally required setback.
II.
Any requests to exceed the maximum building height shall not exceed four feet above the original maximum allowed for the development.
III.
Requests for changes to the parking requirements shall not be reduced by more than five percent of the required spaces.
B.
The planning department shall approve an application for an administrative variance when the request meets the standards outline in section 27-8.1.2(7) below, and the variance does not significantly adversely impact an adjacent land use, and is generally in the best interest of the community.
C.
If the planning department determines that it is in the best interest of the community, an administrative variance may be converted into a general variance, and the information submitted shall be presented to the planning commission for review as a general variance according to the provisions below.
6.
For general variance applications, a public hearing shall be held that meets the requirements of section 27-8.1.5 at which action on the variance will be taken by the planning commission.
7.
The planning department or planning commission may authorize variances from the terms of this section upon making all of the following findings:
A.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property;
B.
These conditions do not generally apply to other property in the vicinity;
C.
Because of these conditions, the application of the ordinance to the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property; and
D.
The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property or to the public good, and the character of the district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance.
8.
The planning department and the planning commission may condition approval of an administrative or general variance on the inclusion of additional requirements that will mitigate negative impacts caused by the variance. Such conditions shall be enforceable as requirements of this chapter.
9.
Appeals of a final decision on administrative or general variance shall follow provisions of section 27-8.1.5 below.
