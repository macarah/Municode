DIVISION 2. - ASSET AND REAL PROPERTY POLICY

Sec. 2-563. - Scope.
The purpose of this policy is to clearly define assets and real property, purchased or held, by Lumpkin County Government and the proper procedures for the inventory and disposal of such assets.
(Res. No. 2017-86, exh. A, 11-21-2017)
Sec. 2-564. - Definitions.
(1)
Asset. Any item purchased by the county that has an initial, individual cost over $5,000.00 and a useful life of over two years, a serial number, or any item or group of items that is tracked on the county's general ledger as an asset.
(2)
Real property. Any real estate and improvements on such property.
(Res. No. 2017-86, exh. A, 11-21-2017)
Sec. 2-565. - General objectives.
An asset is defined as any item purchased, or held, by Lumpkin County Government that has an initial, individual cost over $5,000.00 and an estimated useful life in excess of two years. Such assets will be placed on the asset inventory maintained by the office of financial administration. Exceptions to this are vehicles and equipment purchased at State Surplus sales that are required to have a tag or have a useful life over two years or book value over $5,000.00. Such items will be placed on the asset listing even if the item's cost was less than $5,000.00. Donated capital assets are to be recorded at their estimated fair market value at the date of donation.
This policy does not apply to "groups" of computers or office furniture purchased that may go over the $5,000.00 limit but individually be less than $5,000.00 unless placing them on the asset listing is beneficial to the county for insurance or depreciation purposes.
Assets of the county shall be counted through a physical inventory annually in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 50-16-140 and 50-16-141 and a record of that inventory turned in to the office of financial administration for audit purposes.
This policy also applies to all serial numbered items such as firearms, radios, pagers, phones, medical equipment, fire hose, gravel, pipe etc. even though these items may individually be less than the fixed asset threshold such items should be accounted for yearly, and while not maintained on the county asset inventory, each department is required to maintain a listing of these items, perform an annual county inventory, and name the person responsible for each item.
Real property that is purchased, or held, by the county shall be reviewed annually for insurance purposes and to make sure the property is still useful to the county.
(Res. No. 2017-86, exh. A, 11-21-2017)
Sec. 2-566. - Disposal of assets.
Assets shall be disposed of once they are no longer of value to the county in accordance with state and local law. Prior to disposal, a listing of all items shall be given to the county manager and division director of finance and special services for review and recommendation for removal from the asset inventory. The list will also be shared with other county departments to determine if an item can be used by another department prior to being placed on a work session agenda. Once the list is finalized, it will be taken before the board of commissioners for final review and a vote taken to dispose of the assets. The disposal of assets shall be handled via a public auction, or if the board of commissioners deems the items to be surplus and of no value, then those items may be disposed via transportation to the Lumpkin County transfer station, with a list of such property dumped returned to finance for inclusion in the annual inventory file, or sold for scrap. If items are sold for scrap, a listing of the items shall accompany the check when it is delivered to finance.
The board of commissioners utilizes GovDeals for the disposal of assets.
County assets under the $5,000.00 threshold, and not covered by this policy, shall be kept in storage until such time a county auction may be advertised and held.
The board may also consider trading vehicles or equipment in with the value applied to the purchase/lease of new vehicles or equipment. Such action shall be spread upon the minutes of the meeting of the board of commissioners.
(Res. No. 2017-86, exh. A, 11-21-2017)

Real property may be sold by any means deemed most advantageous to the county under the particular circumstances, as determined by the board of commissioners. A sale to a private person shall be for highest net purchase price reasonably obtainable by the county. A sale to another unit of government shall be a fair and reasonable purchase price, which need not be as high as the purchase price obtainable from a private person.
(Res. No. 2017-86, exh. A, 11-21-2017)
Sec. 2-568. - Sales to county employees.
In order to prevent the appearance of impropriety, and in keeping with Lumpkin County's Code of Ethics, county employees and elected officials are prohibited from participating in any sale, auction, or transfer of surplus property to the public to include items disposed on GovDeals or any other method of sale, auction or disposal used by Lumpkin County.

Sec. 2-658. - Lumpkin County inter-fund transfer policy.
Interfund transfers are accounting transactions which move fund balance (reserves) from one fund to another. Such transfers are used to 1) move revenues from the fund that the statute or budget requires to collect them to the fund that the statute or budget requires to expend them, and 2) provide unrestricted revenues collected in the general fund (Lumpkin County's primary operating account) to finance various programs accounted for in other funds in accordance with budgetary authorizations. The director of finance as well as the budget/grant analyst possess the designated authority to analyze, prepare, and execute routine/non-routine transfers in the normal course of business. All transfers are allowable under GAAP principles. Generally, any interfund transfer can be categorized into one of two types:
(1)
Residual equity transfers: nonrecurring or non-routine transfers of equity between funds; such equity may or may not be returned by the recipient fund.
(2)
Operating transfers: routine transfers for which there is no intent to return any of the transferred funds to the lending fund.
With the exception of Capital Road Fund transfers to the SPLOST Fund, all inter-fund transfers that occur within the course of business for Lumpkin County are linked directly to the county's general fund; reserves are either a) transferred from the general fund to a recipient fund or b) transferred to the general fund from another fund. Further, these transfers are readily labeled in one of three ways: transfers (expenses to GF), "Due To" transfers (assets/liabilities of GF), and "Due From" transfers (assets/liabilities of GF). Listed below is the breakdown of Lumpkin County's interfund transfers based on said categorization.
Transfers (from GF) to:
• E-911 (for portion of expenses not covered by revenue).
• Multiple grants (to match grant amounts).
• Public defender (county contribution).
• Capital projects (construction projects/capital purchases).
• Solid waste fund.
"Due To" Transfers:
• GF to drug rehabilitation fund (for cash held at year end).
• GF to law library fund (for cash held at year end).
• GF to technology fee fund [probate and magistrate] (for cash held at year end).
• SPLOST fund to GF (for expenditures paid).
• CDBG fund to GF (for health dept. grant expenses).
• Planning fund to GF (for expenditures).
• Hotel/motel tax fund to GF (for funds paid to Chamber of Commerce).
• Public defender to GF (expenditures).
"Due From" Transfers:
• Juvenile services fund to GF (for cash held at year end).
• Other funds to GF (repayment for inmate fund purchases on credit card).
• GF to multiple grants fund (repayment for expenses).

Sec. 2-659. - Lumpkin County electronic check signature policy.
Payroll and accounts payable check distribution: As part of the check distribution process, the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners (in conjunction with the Lumpkin County Finance Department) uses electronic, template-based signatures for all payroll and accounts payable checks. The authorized signatures, explicitly reserved for and designated to the commission chairman, county manager, finance director, and county clerk, are applied (either individually or in some combination thereof) by default to all aforementioned checks during the printing process. All accounts payable checks require two authorized signatures and are generally supplied with the signatures of the county manager and finance director. Payroll checks are supplied with the chairman's signature, which is all that is required. It should be noted that any of the aforementioned signees have authorization to apply their electronic signatures to any type of check, if necessary; however, the county clerk's signature is never sufficient by itself, and must be accompanied by at least one other authorized signature. Without exception, all respective check register or check proof forms are signed by at least two of the aforementioned authorized signees prior to check disbursement. Lumpkin County also utilizes electronic payments for vendor invoices. The check proof of invoices to be paid requires two authorized signatures, most often the county manager, county clerk, or finance director prior to the file being submitted to the bank for processing. The file must also be approved by the finance director or the budget and grants analyst prior to final processing by the bank.
Public defender check distribution: All checks originating and distributed from the public defender fund are also supplied with electronic, template-based signatures; again, only the Chairman, FD, CM, and CC are to be considered authorized signees. Only one authorized signature is needed to validate a PD check, and, generally, the FD's signature is used; however, any of the aforementioned personnel's signatures can be used if the FD is unavailable. Also, only one signature is necessary for a PD check register or check proof, and any one of the four authorized signatures can be used for check/check register verification. Lumpkin County also utilizes electronic payments for vendor invoices. The check proof of invoices to be paid requires one authorized signature, most often the finance director, prior to the file being submitted to the bank for processing. The file must also be approved by the finance director or the budget/grants analyst prior to final processing by the bank.
SPLOST check distribution: All checks originating and distributed from the SPLOST fund are also supplied with electronic, template-based signatures; again, only the Chairman, FD, CM, and CC are to be considered as authorized signees. Two authorized signatures are needed to validate a SF check, and, generally, the FD and CM supply the respective checks with their signatures; however, any of the aforementioned personnel's signatures can be used if either the FD or CM is unavailable. Also, two signatures are necessary for a SF check register or check proof, and any one of the four authorized signatures can be used for check/check register verification. Lumpkin County also utilizes electronic payments for vendor invoices. The check proof of invoices to be paid requires one authorized signature, most often the finance director, prior to the file being submitted to the bank for processing. The file must also be approved by the finance director or the budget/grants analyst prior to final processing by the bank.

Sec. 2-660. - Lumpkin County check distribution policy.
Brief procedural background: With respect to the operational regulations of the Lumpkin County Finance Department, the accounts payable clerk (APC) is solely authorized to prepare for distribution (or, for "pick-up") any and all checks relating to/affecting the general fund, SPLOST fund, and some drug court related funds. Once a check has been printed by the APC, at least two designated county department heads and/or officials (typically the county manager, finance director, county clerk, or some combination thereof) must 1) verify the elements of the check and 2) add their signature of approval before sending the check to the accounting clerk (AC) for distribution. Once submitted to the AC, the check is sealed in an envelope and held securely for its intended recipient.
Policy: After the AC has received the printed and verified check, he/she sends an email notification to its intended recipient. Some checks are produced on a weekly/bi-weekly/monthly basis and may or may not require email notification. Typically, most checks prepared for pick-up are entitled to county employees, but there are some vendors that request pick-up. Unless otherwise noted or excepted, all completed and available checks are to be distributed exclusively to department heads and/or authorized personnel from the company vendor; this measure should substantially diminish the possibility of any kind of confusion in relation to procedure as well as fraudulent incidents, thereby decreasing the county's (and the respective department's/vendor's) overall liability. At the discretion of the FD and AC, some checks can be distributed to county employees who do not manage their respective departments. Lastly, the employee/designated department official/vendor representative picking up the check must sign the accompanying check stub before leaving. This measure will further ensure quality control when said stubs (and all supplemental/remaining documentation relating to the checks) are digitally scanned into DocuScan.
The AC keeps all distributable checks in a single folder that is secured in the safe. Again, unless otherwise excepted, department heads are exclusively permitted to pick-up any check respective to their branch. If/when, hypothetically, a check is being requested and the AC is unavailable to distribute, any one finance department employee has authorization to distribute the requested check as long as he/she verifies that the check sufficiently matches the recipient's request and information.
Every effort will be made to have all checks available for pick-up every Friday after 2:00 p.m. In the event that a nationally or locally recognized holiday falls on any given Friday, or if an extended holiday (Thanksgiving, Christmas) should take up the majority of a given work week (especially the end of the week), checks will either be a) available for pick-up before the holiday begins or b) available in the upcoming week after the holiday, depending on the given workload for the department.

Sec. 2-661. - Lumpkin County money safe policy.
Any department serving under the authority of the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners that receives, handles, stores, or deposits monies shall be required to use a security safe (with a lock and/or combination, preferably/specifically designed to protect money) for the purposes of housing and securing all said monies. Regardless of the department's protocol procedures for managing monies, all monies receipted in a given business day are to be securely stored in a safe at the close of that business day as a way of ensuring the monies' location. The safe should be stored within the department's designated building in an inconspicuous location, preferably in a lockable closet or underneath a desk. With the exception of authorized employees, this location should be inaccessible to all persons. All doors and rooms surrounding the safe are to be locked at the close of every business day.
