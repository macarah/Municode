(1)
For maximum protection to the public through the orderly control of traffic entering and leaving a part of the county roadway system to reduce traffic conflicts and confusion;
(2)
To make ingress and egress as safe as possible to the traveling public and to those who patronize the roadside commercial establishments;
(3)
To prevent hazardous and indiscriminate parking adjacent to the roadway surface;
(4)
To ensure uniform design and construction of driveways on the county roadway system;
(5)
To keep driveway construction from interfering with the safety of the traveling public; and
(6)
To provide for future modification and expansion.
(b)
Applicability. This standard is applicable to all roads under the jurisdiction of the board of commissioners including frontage roads and service roads of limited access highways. However, these provisions do not apply to roads under the jurisdiction of the state department of transportation.

b.
Joint driveways are required when one of the following is present:
1.
Commercial and industrial lots with less than 300 feet of right-of-way frontage; and
2.
Fronts a roadway with more than 2,000 trips per day.
(h)
Driveway design.

(2)
Angle.
a.
The angle of one-way driveways with the roadway shall be as close to 90 degrees as possible.
b.
Driveways used for two-way operation shall intersect the roadway at an angle as near 90 degrees as possible.
c.
If joined with another two-way driveway conditions shall be that no vehicle will have to make a deflection of greater than 90 degrees when entering or leaving the property.
(3)
Driveway radii. Curb cut radius shall be at least 20 feet and not greater than 35 feet for commercial developments. For industrial developments curb cut radius shall be at least 25 feet and not greater than 40 feet.

For nonresidential driveways, the grade of the driveway shall slope downward and away from the road surface at the rate not less than 2.0 percent or more than 6.25 percent out to the road ditch line, but in no case less than 18 feet from the edge of the pavement. Where the roadway pavement is super-elevated and the upper shoulder is graded to the slope of the pavement, the grade of the driveway shall conform to the slope of the shoulder to a point 12 feet from the edge of the pavement. However, beyond this 12-foot line the driveway and islands shall be designed to rollover grade so that water from this area will not flow onto the roadway shoulder or pavement. In some cases it may not be feasible to continue the slope of the pavement upward with the super elevation. In such cases the planning director shall make this determination during his inspection and review of the permit request and will revise the plans submitted accordingly, as well as provide adequate documentation as to why this variance was made in this particular instance. Through the remaining right-of-way width the grade of the driveways shall not be greater than 6.25 percent, positive or negative. In areas where the right-of-way exists, the elevation of the driveway at the right-of-way line shall not be more than one foot higher or lower than the edge of the road at the point opposite that point on the driveway unless specifically waived by the planning director and documented on the plan as to why the waiver was justified.

Acceleration lanes shall also be required where it is determined by the planning director that they are needed because of the nature of the business or type traffic in question. Such lanes shall be constructed at no cost to the county. The right-of-way for such lanes and for future provision of acceleration lanes shall be dedicated to the county by the applicant.
b.
The pavement section for the lanes shall match that of the main road or be a lesser design if approved by the planning director. In areas where there will remain an open road side ditch, curb and gutter will not generally be required along the longitudinal part of the deceleration/acceleration lanes, but shall be provided on the radii, medians, etc., in order to prevent pot holes in the radius of the drive.
c.
Deceleration lanes shall be required of all developments that have at least one of the following criteria present:
1.
Frontage road has more than 10,000 ADTs;
2.
Frontage road has speed limit of 45 miles per hour or greater;
3.

The side of the island adjacent to the highway travel lane shall be located at the existing curbline if any. Otherwise the side of the island shall be ten or more feet from the edge of the pavement as specified by the county. If approved by the planning director the distance between the side of the island and the edge of the pavement may be less than ten feet.
(2)
Unpaved islands. The area or island between the uncurbed driveways serving roadside enterprises shall remain unpaved unless a sidewalk is required of sufficient width to cover the entire island.
(3)
Open ditch islands. Where a roadside ditch exists, providing an acceptable obstacle to prevent vehicular traffic over the island, the applicant may request to retain the condition. If approved by the county, delineation of the driveway and roadway will not be required. However, an acceptable barrier consisting of six or eight vertical concrete curb, six inches or more in height which shall circumscribe those islands installed between and on either side of the driveways.
(j)
Encroachment upon intersection design. No portion of a driveway other than a normal radius shall enter the right-of-way at a point at distances of less than 25 feet from the point of intersection of the right-of-way lines

Suitable vegetative cover or mulch shall be applied immediately following construction to all disturbed areas and rights-of-way. Mass grading of subdivision roads and lots together is prohibited.
(b)
Permanent drainage structures shall be designed for anticipated runoff of a 24-hour, 25-year storm and installed in the initial phase of road construction. These structures shall be protected and kept open to control runoff. These structures must be grouted, clean, undamaged and in proper working order prior to the issuance of a final approval.
(c)
All streets shall have shoulders of no less than nine feet in width, clear of all obstruction other than breakaway posts, with a slope of no greater than 1.25 inches per foot and no less than 0.75 inch per foot.
(d)
All finished driveways entering on a county maintained paved road must be hard surfaced (asphalt or concrete) from the edge of pavement to not less than 30 feet or the edge of the ROW whichever is greater. (Some subdivision classes require paved drives) The driveway must be designed to divert water into the roadside ditches or onto areas other than the road. This item will be inspected at or before the final inspection for the house and a certificate of occupancy will not be issued if this requirement is not met.
(e)
All residential subdivision entrances serving 25 lots or more shall have a deceleration lane. The lane length shall be determined by the design engineer using accepted standards. (See section 26-544, the county standard details.) A 50-foot taper shall be provided to serve as an acceleration lane. The planning commission may accept or increase the length depending on local conditions. On state rights-of-way the need and length shall be determined by the state DOT.
(f)
The proposed county right-of-way shall be cleared the full required width of all trees, bushes, debris and other materials.
(g)
No signs, structures, wells, or other items, except mail boxes, are allowed on the county right-of-way.

Sec. 26-227. - Exemption from curb and gutter requirement.
In a residential subdivision where all lot sizes are larger than one acre the use of curb and gutter to county standards shall be at the option of the developer. In class IV and class V subdivisions, a variance to the curb and gutter requirement may be applied for.
