Temporary exit requirements. A temporary exit must be installed and maintained for any timbering operation in the county at any point of egress from a timber harvesting tract onto a public right-of-way or road. Such exit must be established and maintained prior to any timber hauling vehicles or timbering equipment leaving the site, and shall be maintained until the timber hauling operation is completed, and shall meet or exceed the following specifications:
a.
The exit pad shall be adequate to substantially eliminate the transport of mud from the timber site by either vehicles or equipment or from water runoff.
b.
The exit pad of gravel or stone (1.5 to 3.5 inch stone) must at least be 20 feet in width by 50 feet in length with a depth of six inches, with a geo-textile underliner. The pad may be required to be an additional width, length and/or depth if, in the opinion of planning department staff, conditions so warrant.
c.
At such exit location there may be required a cleaning station, water pump station or some other such means to rinse or clean the exiting vehicle of sediment and debris prior to its entrance onto the public right-of-way.
(3)
Contamination of rights-of-way. No timber operator shall allow dirt, mud or other debris resulting from timber operations to accumulate upon the right-of-way of any public road to such an extent that it becomes a nuisance or hazard to persons traveling upon such roads, or that it creates an unsightly condition upon the public right-of-way.
(4)
Interference with drainage. No timber operator shall allow dirt, mud or other debris resulting from timber operations to accumulate in ditches and drainage areas on public rights-of-way to such an extent that the usual flow of water or runoff is stopped, disturbed, changed or interrupted.
(5)
Cleanup and reimbursement. Any materials or mud spilled, dropped, washed or tracked from vehicles or equipment leaving the site onto roadways or into public rights-of-way, drainage ditches or storm drains constitutes a violation of this article, must be removed within 24 hours or the county may perform any necessary corrective work and the timber operator shall reimburse the county for any expenses incurred, either directly or from the required bond or letter of credit.
(6)
Fines. In addition to any cleanup costs that shall be reimbursed to the county, any timber operator failing to comply with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, or failing to clean up or remove any debris, dirt, mud or other material from any public road, right-of-way or drainage ditch, within 24 hours of the spill or contamination, shall be fined $500.00 upon the first citation, and $1,000.00 upon each subsequent citation.
