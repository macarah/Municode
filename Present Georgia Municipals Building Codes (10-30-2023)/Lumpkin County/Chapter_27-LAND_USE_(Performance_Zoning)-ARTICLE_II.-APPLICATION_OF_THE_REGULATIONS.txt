Sec. 27-2.2.3. - Chart of performance standards.
Activities are permitted or prohibited on property, based on the development category to which the property has been assigned and, further, based on the road classification to which the property is adjacent as shown in Table 1, below. An activity is permitted only where a diamond appears in the "Road Classification" column corresponding to the activity for the relevant (Restrictive ("R") or General ("G")) development category. For properties with more than one adjacent right-of-way, access to the development will only be allowed from the ROW meeting the Performance Standard Requirements for the proposed use. The road classification column designations are A=arterial, C=collector, L=local. Similarly, minimum lot size, buffers, setbacks and screening requirements are based on the proposed use in the relevant development category.
All activities listed in the performance standards chart except Single Family Residences, Home Occupations, and Short-Term Rentals are classified as commercial uses.
*** All commercial activities in both development categories shall also meet the requirements in Ch. 26.

  (Res. No. 2022-20, 5-3-2022)
Sec. 27-2.2.4. - Buffers.
No activity is permitted in a buffer other than necessary utility functions such as transmission lines, underground conduits, underground stormwater management devices, unfenced dry detention ponds that have designed as part of the landscaping of the buffer area, etc. A single driveway access may encroach upon this buffer when that driveway location is the only possible point of access for the parcel. This area is described by a linear measurement from the property line inward and will vary depending on the nature of an activity and its location.
The Chart of Performance Standards in section 27-2.2.3, Table 1., lists the required buffers.
(Res. No. 2022-20, 5-3-2022)
Sec. 27-2.2.5. - Setbacks.
Setbacks delineate certain open spaces on lots. These spaces are linear distances measured from property lines inward. Buildings, other principal structures, or areas comprising the principal activity of the lot may not encroach within the setback area. A setback may accept an accessory activity such as parking, unless superseded by a buffer. Accessory buildings to residential activities must maintain a minimum five-foot setback from adjoining property lines.
Mechanical equipment, or other necessary utilities attached to a principal structure, shall not be allowed in the setback area. The Chart of Performance Standards in section 27-2.2.3, lists two types of setbacks based on the type of activity and location. They are measured either from a road right-of-way or an adjoining property line.
(Res. No. 2022-20, 5-3-2022)
Sec. 27-2.2.6. - Screening.
Screening consists of natural vegetation, landscaped vegetation (including planted berms), walls, or fences designed to lessen the visual interaction between adjacent activities or accessories thereto. Vegetation used for screening must be evergreen, drought-tolerant, insect and disease resistant, and appropriate for the area. Screening may be required with no buffer involved, or in combination with a buffer. The height of the screening shall be sufficient to screen the view of the activity for which the screening is required from the protected property. The two types of screening listed in the Chart of Performance Standards in section 27-2.2.3, are total and partial, and are measured in linear feet. If the activity occurs within the designated distance of the protected property line, then that type screening is required. Total screening is defined as being visually opaque. Partial screening is defined as being approximately 50 percent visually opaque, and should include the protection of naturally vegetated areas.
All partial screening requirements must be met using vegetation unless there is a geographic reason that such screening is impossible to achieve. The use of fencing, walls, or berms may be considered for larger areas that require total screening, however, in those situations, vegetation must be used for at least 50 percent of the screening requirement and placed on the side of the fence, wall, or berm that faces the protected property. In all cases, the materials, type, and plant materials used for screening must be approved by the planning director. When fences and/or walls are utilized, the finished side must face the protected property and any vegetation used must be placed on the outside of the fence or wall.
Required plantings for total screening must be a minimum of six-feet in height at planting and installed in at least two staggered rows. Required plantings to supplement natural vegetation for partial screening must be a minimum of four to five feet in height at planting and may be installed in a single row. The spacing of the plantings will vary depending on the plant species/variety, planting conditions, required opacity, and size of plants at installation. All vegetation installed to meet applicable screening requirements must supply the necessary screening within three growing seasons following installation.
(Res. No. 2022-20, 5-3-2022)
Sec. 27-2.2.7. - Application of performance standards.
The columnar chart above lists the performance standards defined in this chapter as they apply to the list of principal activities. The procedure for determining the performance standards that will apply to a particular project or site shall be as outlined in the following sections.
(Res. No. 2022-20, 5-3-2022)
Sec. 27-2.2.8. - Definitions.
1.
Protected property: This is property which is protected from the impacts of land uses on surrounding properties by means of specified performance standards contained in this ordinance.
2.
Protected property line: This is a character area boundary line or a property line or a portion thereof from which, across which, or at which performance standards contained in this ordinance are measured. Some of the protected property lines for a particular project, especially if it is an intense activity, may include more than just those adjacent property lines. They could be located across adjacent property or road rights-of-way but close enough to be included in the distance and screening standards as well as those for sound, light, and glare.
3.
Protected residential use: This is the use of lots approved for development or a residential use in existence or permitted for construction before the adoption of this ordinance.
4.
Abandoned residential structure: This is a residential structure which is derelict or uninhabitable for a continuous period of 12 months or greater shall not be considered a protected use. An uninhabited residence shall not in and of itself constitute abandonment.
(Res. No. 2022-20, 5-3-2022)
Sec. 27-2.2.9. - Options for determining performance standards.
A request for a land use permit which utilizes the performance standards as published shall be approved with respect to the requirements of this chapter. A request for a land use permit which proposes to utilize performance standards less than the numbers listed must employ one of the following two procedures. More than one option may be used on a project site, but options shall not overlap the same protected property line.
1.
Property owner consent agreement: If the owner of any protected property consents to the employment of a performance standard other than as required in this chapter, such consent shall be noted on a form provided by Lumpkin County. This consent shall become valid only upon verification by the planning director and attachment to the applicable land use permit. Such a consent agreement shall not be allowed to apply to any conditional use activity in article IV, any special land use approvals in article VI, Sound Amplifying Equipment or Dark Sky Friendly Lighting standards. A consent agreement shall be allowed to remove a restriction that makes an activity a legal nonconformity as described in article IX if it is not a conditional use or special land use approval.
2.
Planning commission variance request: If a consent agreement pursuant to subparagraph 1, above, is not able to be obtained, the applicant may apply to the planning commission for a decision following the variance procedures outlined in chapter 2 of article VIII, Procedures and Permits. Once the planning commission renders a decision, the applicant may not utilize the process outlined in the previous paragraph unless significant aspects of the permit request have been modified or the ownership of the protected property has changed.
(Res. No. 2022-20, 5-3-2022)
Sec. 27-2.2.10. - General rules.
1.
The restrictive (R) requirements in the Chart apply to protected property lines within a restrictive development category or those which serve as the boundary between a restrictive development and general development category, the City of Dahlonega within Lumpkin County, or an adjacent county.
2.
The general (G) requirements in the Chart apply to protected property lines within a general development category or those which serve as a boundary between the City of Dahlonega, or an adjacent county.
3.
For property lines which serve as the boundary between a restrictive development category and a general development category, the restrictive (R) requirements shall apply for the protection of property on the restrictive development category side of the boundary relative to land uses on the general development category side of the boundary. Similarly, the general (G) requirements shall apply for the protection of property on the general development category side of the boundary relative to land uses on the restrictive development category side of the boundary.
4.
When an activity is located on a parcel which is separated from surrounding protected property by existing road rights-of-way, by utility rights-of-way, by water bodies, or by other parcels, then the performance standards applicable to that activity shall be measured across such separation from the protected property lines.
(Res. No. 2022-20, 5-3-2022)
Sec. 27-2.2.11. - Chart of performance standards.
In all character areas, all permitted activities shall comply with the additional performance standards contained in sections 27-2.2.12—27-2.2.14 in this article. For activities particularly associated with anticipated higher degrees of sound and light, the land use application and site plan submittal shall address the proposed method(s) of compliance with the standards for sound amplification and light.
(Res. No. 2022-20, 5-3-2022)
Sec. 27-2.2.12. - Sound amplifying equipment and light.
In case of conflict between the performance standards set forth herein and other requirements of this chapter or regulations adopted by any other governmental agencies, the more restrictive shall apply.
For the purpose of determining the applicability of the provisions of chapter 34, Use of Sound Amplification, and [section] 27-2.2.13, Light and Glare, only, an adjacent residential use is a protected use if the residential use is within 250 feet of the property line.
(Res. No. 2022-20, 5-3-2022)
Sec. 27-2.2.13. - Light and glare.
1.
Definitions.
Foot candle: a unit of illumination, constituting the illumination at all points one foot distant from a uniform point source of one candlepower.
Glare: the disturbing quality of direct illumination which, although not necessarily providing a measurable amount of light from a given vantage point, causes intense light that reduces visibility and causes discomfort when viewed.
2.
Limitation of illumination. In all character areas, any operation or activity producing light from a non-mobile source, such as spotlights, shall not cause illumination in excess of ½-foot candle when measured in a restrictive development category or across the protected property line of a protected residential use. Cars, trucks, and other vehicles traveling on highways, etc., are exempt.
3.
Limitation of glare.
A.
In all character areas, any activity producing glare from a non-mobile source shall be constructed so that glare is not directed into a Restrictive Development Character Area, across the protected property line of an adjacent protected residential use, or into travel lanes of public roads. Pole mounted lighting fixtures must be located such that the direction of the light is inward away from the property lines and away from the travel lanes of adjacent roads. When needed, fixtures must be shielded to mitigate the effects of glare.
B.
Lights underneath vehicle canopies shall also be installed in flush-mounted recessed fixtures so that glare is not directed into a restrictive development category, across the protected property line of an adjacent protected residential use, or into travel lanes of public roads.
(Res. No. 2022-20, 5-3-2022)
Sec. 27-2.2.14. - Dark sky friendly lighting.
1.
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to regulate outdoor night-time lighting fixtures dark sky friendly compliant in order to preserve, protect and enhance Lumpkin County's dark sky while conserving energy, permitting reasonable and safe use of outdoor night-time lighting, minimizing glare and obtrusive light, and helping to protect the natural environment from the damaging effects of night lighting.
This section seeks to eliminate lighting that shines upwards rather than in the direction needed. The benefits of such lighting are an increased number of stars visible at night, reduced effects of electric lighting on the natural environment, and a reduction in energy usage. To maximize these benefits lighting shall:
A.
Only be on when needed
B.
Only light the area that needs it Be no brighter than necessary
C.
Minimize blue light emissions
D.
Be fully shielded (pointing downward)
2.
