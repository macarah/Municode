Sec. 18-67. - Purpose.
(a)
It is the finding of the mayor and council that it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the public to regulate the use of the Dalton Municipal Airport by ultralight vehicles. A portion of this regulation is to ensure the compatible use of the Dalton Municipal Airport by ultralight vehicles with conventional powered aircraft.
(b)
Ultralight vehicles are a recent phenomenon in terms of use of airport facilities and pose special considerations in terms of air, passenger and ground operations safety in their use of the airport.
(c)
Airport operators may make the determination that ultralight vehicle operations are unsafe and prohibit conduct of ultralight vehicle operations on the airport at any time, whether under emergency conditions or otherwise.
(d)
Airport operators are obliged to ensure that users of federally assisted airports contribute a fair share toward their operation, and thus a user fee may be imposed on ultralight vehicle operators.
(Code 1983, § 3.5-21)
Sec. 18-68. - Operation.
(a)
The mayor and council find that ultralight vehicles pose special considerations in terms of air and passenger safety, ground safety and property protection in their use at the airport. The Federal Aviation Administration requires a federally assisted airport to accommodate ultralight vehicles if ultralight operations can be safely accomplished at a designated ultralight operations area on the airport. Since the airport is a federally assisted airport and it is the policy of the city to ensure continued development of the airport into a regional facility for private and commercial air traffic, the operational conditions and restrictions in this section shall govern access and use of the airport by ultralight vehicles.
(b)
Ultralight vehicles shall be restricted to the ultralight pattern for all takeoffs and landings. The ultralight pattern and operating area shall be designated by the airport manager and shall be posted in at least three conspicuous locations throughout the facility of the airport. The ultralight operating area on the runway of the airport shall be a minimum area of 300 by 30 feet as per exhibit A, attached to the ordinance from which this section derives and made a part of this article by reference.
(c)
Ultralight vehicle operation shall be restricted to those operating times as designated by the airport manager who shall, upon request of any person expressing an interest in ultralight vehicle use of the airport, publish a biweekly schedule of operating times for ultralight vehicles on the airport. Such notice shall be posted at three conspicuous locations throughout the airport.
(d)
It shall be a violation of the rules and regulations in article II of this chapter and this article for any ultralight vehicle to operate on the airport or be in the traffic pattern of the airport outside the times permitted by the airport manager. Any person who shall violate this subsection shall be subject to citation to the municipal court and, upon conviction for such violation, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00 and/or 30 days in confinement.
(e)
The operator of an ultralight vehicle desiring to use the airport shall be required to provide the airport manager, prior to use of the airport, a certificate of public liability insurance covering all events in an amount of not less than $1,000,000.00 combined single limit. Any person operating an ultralight vehicle at the airport without filing such certificate of insurance shall be in violation of this article and shall be subject to citation to the municipal court and, upon conviction for such violation, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00 and/or 30 days in confinement.
(f)
Unless otherwise modified by written directive as set forth in this section by the airport manager, the ultralight pattern shall be the pattern shown on exhibit A, to the ordinance from which this section derives.
(Code 1983, § 3.5-62)
Editor's note— A copy of exhibit A as adopted herein by reference is on file in the office of the city clerk.
Sec. 18-69. - Rules and regulations.
All operations including but not limited to ground and air operations at the airport, taxiing, takeoffs, landings, fueling, storage and flight within the traffic pattern or airspace within two radial miles from the center of the runway of the airport to an altitude of 1,000 feet mean sea level (msl) by ultralight vehicles shall be subject to the following:
(1)
The ultralight operating area on the runway of the airport shall be marked by black or white lines on the runway or by flexible flags.
(2)
Ultralight vehicles shall not taxi on the taxi lanes or aprons of the airport or upon airport runways except for making a direct approach to the runway for purposes of takeoff or for purposes of clearing the runway after landing in accordance with sound aviation practice.
(3)
Ultra light vehicles shall not taxi, take off or land at the airport except during those operating times designated by the airport manager, who shall publish a schedule of approved operating times for ultralight vehicles on the airport if there shall be any request for ultralight vehicle use. The direction of the ultralight pattern for takeoffs and landings on the airport shall be designated by the airport manager as necessary to be compatible with other airport traffic. The airport manager is authorized to prohibit ultralight vehicle operations at the airport for safety purposes in his discretion, and the duty to issue an advisory on operational times for ultralight vehicles does not mean that ultralight vehicles shall be entitled to use the airport at all times. In making any decision as to the prohibition of ultralight vehicle operations at the airport for safety purposes, the airport manager shall consider the following: frequency of use of the airport by ultralight vehicles simultaneously with conventional powered aircraft operations from a single runway; the adequacy of the ultralight vehicle pattern; and related general air and ground safety matters affecting vehicle, aircraft, ground, personnel, passenger, pilot and general public safety.
(4)
Ultralight vehicles upon takeoff shall proceed outbound to an area of not less than two radial miles from the center of the runway of the airport to hover, cruise or perform in-flight maneuvers. Therefore, no ultralight vehicle shall hover, cruise or perform in-flight maneuvers after takeoff within the two-radial-mile area from the center of the runway except for approach to the airport for landing purposes.
(5)
Proof of insurance shall be filed with the airport manager who shall keep the proof on file and who may request verification of such insurance from time to time. For purposes of this subsection any ultralight vehicle operator who shall not have the requisite public liability insurance shall be once warned of the public liability insurance requirement before being cited with violation of this subsection. This warning may be cumulative with the warning under subsection (6) of this section. The airport manager and/or the police department shall retain a record of all warnings, including but not limited to the name, residence address and other identification of the ultralight vehicle operator so warned. The airport manager shall have the authority to issue such warnings. Upon violation of this subsection after any such warning, the operator shall be subject to the penalties set forth in subsection 18-68(e) upon conviction as in this section.
(6)
All ultralight vehicles shall be equipped with workable communications equipment. No person shall operate an ultralight vehicle in any area of airspace governed by this article who shall not be a licensed radio operator for purposes of operating communications equipment. Any person who shall operate an ultralight vehicle from the airport or within the areas governed by this article without workable communication equipment and/or who shall not be a licensed radio operator shall be in violation of this article and upon conviction in the municipal court may be fined not less than $100.00 and not more than $250.00. For purposes of this subsection, any ultralight vehicle operator who shall not have workable communications equipment and/or be a licensed individual shall be warned once of such requirements, and this does not mean once as to each requirement but a warning cumulative of subsection (5) of this section and this subsection before being cited for violation of this section. The airport manager and/or police department shall retain a record of all warnings, including but not limited to the name, residence address and other identification information on the operator so warned. The airport manager shall have authority to issue such warnings. Upon violation of this subsection after any such warning, the operator shall be subject to the fine set forth in this subsection upon conviction.
