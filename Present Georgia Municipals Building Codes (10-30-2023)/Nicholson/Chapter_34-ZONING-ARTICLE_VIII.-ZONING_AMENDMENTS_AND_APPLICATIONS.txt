ARTICLE VIII. - ZONING AMENDMENTS AND APPLICATIONS

Sec. 34-256. - Procedures for calling and conducting public hearings.
(a)
Applicability. Public hearings held by the City Council as required by this chapter with regard to rezoning requests (amendments to the official zoning map), applications for conditional uses, applications for variances, and appeals of any administrative decision shall be called and conducted in accordance with the procedures of this section. If the planning commission elects to hold a public hearing or is otherwise obligated to hold a public hearing per the requirements of this chapter, then the planning commission shall call and conduct its public hearings in accordance with this section, and this section shall in such cases be interpreted accordingly. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting a presiding officer or hearing body from conducting a public hearing in a fair, orderly, and decorous manner.
(b)
Presiding officer. The presiding officer shall preside over the public hearing. In the case of the City Council, the Mayor shall preside, or in the absence of the Mayor the Mayor Pro Tempore shall preside, or in the absence of both the Mayor and Mayor Pro Tempore another member of the City Council shall be designated to preside, over the public hearing. In the case of the planning commission, if a public hearing is required or held, the chairperson of said commission shall preside, or in the absence of the chairperson the vice-chairperson, or if neither is present to preside another member of the commission shall be designated to preside.
(c)
Opening of public hearing. The presiding officer shall indicate that a public hearing has been called on one or more applications made pursuant to this chapter shall summarize the processes required by this article (or call on the Zoning Administrator to summarize), and shall open the public hearing. Thereupon, the presiding officer shall call the first case and the City Council shall consider each application on an individual basis in succession as printed on the published agenda or as otherwise approved by the City Council; provided, however, that the presiding officer may at his discretion call and consider more than one application simultaneously when more than one application involves the same piece of property, and/or when proceedings would be efficiently completed by combining separately required public hearings and discussing more than one scheduled matter as a single group of applications.
(d)
Report of Zoning Administrator. Upon opening the public hearing, the presiding officer may recognize the Zoning Administrator, who may provide a summary of the application and present any recommendations or results of investigations. Unless a member of the planning commission is present and is authorized and willing to speak for the planning commission on the subject application, the Zoning Administrator may also summarize the recommendations made by the planning commission. Any member of the City Council upon recognition by the presiding officer may ask questions of the Zoning Administrator or designee or other city or planning commission representative providing a report or recommendations. The Zoning Administrator and/or planning commission may be represented at the public hearing by written report in lieu of oral testimony.
(e)
Identification of speakers. Prior to speaking, each speaker (including applicant, agent of applicant, and all others) must identify himself and state his current address for the record. The presiding officer may require a speaker to complete an information card supplying such information, prior to testifying.
(f)
Applicant and those in favor of the application. When an individual application comes up for hearing, the presiding officer may ask for a show of hands of those persons who wish to appear in support of the application. If it appears that the number of persons wishing to appear in support of the application is in excess of those who may reasonably be heard, the presiding officer may request that a spokesperson for the group be chosen to make presentations. Following the report of the Zoning Administrator or designee, or planning commission spokesperson, if any, the presiding officer shall recognize the applicant or his agent, spokesperson, or each of them, who shall present and explain the application, followed by any other persons wishing to speak in favor of the application. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that approval of the proposed application will promote the public health, safety, or general welfare. There shall be a minimum time period of ten minutes per application at the public hearing for the applicant and/or agent and anyone in favor of the application to present data, evidence, and opinions. The City Council shall not be obligated to provide the full ten-minute period to the proponents if they elect not to use that much time, nor shall there be an obligation to provide a minimum of ten minutes per application in the event that more than one application involving the same property is heard simultaneously. An applicant or agent may reserve any remaining unused time from the allotted time period for rebuttal. Upon the completion of testimony or remarks by the applicant and/or applicant's agent and those speaking in favor of the application, any member of the City Council upon recognition by the presiding officer may ask questions of the applicant or agent of the applicant, or both, or any person speaking in favor of the application.
(g)
Questions and opposing public comments on the application. At the conclusion of the applicant's presentation and any testimony by others in favor of the application, the presiding officer shall call for public comments from those who wish to ask questions, make comments or oppose the application. The presiding officer may ask for a show of hands of those persons who wish to ask questions, make comments, and/or speak in opposition to the application. If it appears that the number of persons wishing to ask questions, make comments, and/or speak in opposition to the application is in excess of those who may reasonably be heard, the presiding officer may request that a spokesperson for the group be chosen to make presentations, ask questions, or speak in opposition. There shall be a minimum time period of ten minutes per application at the public hearing for the opponents to present data, evidence, and opinions and ask questions. The City Council shall not be obligated to provide the full ten minutes per application to the opponents if they elect not to use that much time, nor shall there be an obligation to provide a minimum of ten minutes per application in the event that more than one application involving the same property is heard simultaneously. Upon the completion of testimony or remarks by those asking questions and/or speaking in opposition to the application, any member of the City Council upon recognition by the presiding officer may ask questions of those speakers.
(h)
Response to questions. Upon the completion of testimony or remarks by those asking questions and/or speaking in opposition to the application, the presiding officer may ask the Zoning Administrator, if present, to answer questions posed by speakers; answer such questions himself; recognize a member of the City Council to make remarks or answer questions in response to such questions; or defer questions to the applicant to be answered during rebuttal.
(i)
Content of remarks. Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the proposed application under consideration and shall address his remarks only to the City Council and not directly to the audience. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or the discussion of facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed application under consideration. The presiding officer may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue, if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this procedure.
(j)
Applicant's rebuttal. Upon the conclusion of public testimony, if the ten minutes allotted to the applicant and those speaking in favor of the application has not been exhausted, the applicant or his agent, or both, shall be allowed the remaining time from the total ten minutes allotted to answer questions, rebut the testimony of speakers, and/or provide final comments and remarks. The time devoted to any such rebuttal shall be counted toward the total ten minutes allotted to the applicant if such a time limit is set by the presiding officer. Any member of the City Council upon recognition by the presiding officer may then ask questions of the applicant, his agent, or both.
(k)
Equal time. In no event shall this section be interpreted to, and in no case shall the presiding officer allow or permit, an unequal amount of time to proponents and opponents with respect to testimony regarding an individual application.
(l)
Close of hearing. After the foregoing procedures have been completed, the presiding officer will close the public hearing and indicate that the public hearing is closed. Upon the closing of the public hearing, the applicant or his agent and any member of the public shall no longer be permitted to address the City Council in any way, including hand waving or motions for attention; provided, however, that at any time considered appropriate the presiding officer may reopen the public hearing for a limited time and purpose.
(m)
Decision. After the public hearing is closed, the City Council may either vote upon the application or may delay its vote to a subsequent meeting, subject to the limitations of this article, provided that notice of the time, date and location when such application will be further considered shall be announced at the meeting during which the public hearing is held. After hearing evidence, in making a decision, the City Council will apply the evidence to the criteria specified in this article for the application in question and other considerations and recommendations as may be considered appropriate. If the City Council determines from the evidence presented by the applicant has shown that the proposed application promotes the health, safety, and general welfare under applicable criteria, then the application shall be granted, subject to those reasonable conditions as may be imposed by the City Council on its own initiative or as recommended by the Zoning Administrator and/or the planning commission. Otherwise, such application shall be denied.

(5)
Letter of intent describing the regulations to be varied (specific sections and the amount of numerical variation sought), and including analysis of how the proposed development compares favorably with one or more of the criteria for granting variances as established in this section;
(6)
If pertaining to future development, a site plan of the property and proposed development shall be submitted at an appropriate engineering scale showing the proposed use and relevant information regarding the variance request.

In addition, notice shall include the location of the property and the section or section proposed to be varied; and a sign containing said required information shall be placed in a conspicuous location on the property not less than 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing before the City Council and which shall remain through the date of any public hearings advertised thereon.
(i)
Criteria for variances. One or more of the following criteria may be considered applicable or potentially applicable:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions or practical difficulties pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district.
(2)
A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would effectively deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties of the district in which the property is located.
(3)
Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located.

The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare.
(5)
The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant.

(l)
Limitations on the frequency of filing applications.

Who may appeal. Any person who alleges there is an error in, or who is aggrieved by a decision of the Zoning Administrator in the administration, interpretation, or enforcement of this chapter, may file an appeal with the City Council, stating the grounds for such appeal. Appeals of administrative decisions may also be filed for consideration by any officer, department, or board or commission of the city, affected by any such administrative decision. Said appeal application shall be filed within 30 days of the date of the final administrative decision. A fee shall be paid to the Zoning Administrator at the time the notice of appeal is filed, as specified by resolution of the City Council.
(c)
Transmittal of application. Any appeal received and all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken shall forthwith be transmitted by the Zoning Administrator to the planning commission for recommendation and to the City Council for decision.
(d)
Referral to and recommendation by planning commission. Upon receipt of a completed application for appeal or within a reasonable time thereafter, the Zoning Administrator shall refer the application to the planning commission. The meeting at which the planning commission considers the application shall be open to the public, but the planning commission meeting shall not be required to be an advertised public hearing and the planning commission shall not be obligated to but may hold a public hearing on the application. The planning commission shall make a recommendation on the application within 30 days of the meeting it is first scheduled to consider the application, and its recommendation shall be submitted to the City Council. The planning commission may submit any additional report it deems appropriate. The applicant will be notified in writing by the Zoning Administrator of the recommendation within seven working days of the decision. The recommendation and any report shall upon publication be available upon request to the public. The recommendation of the planning commission shall have an advisory effect only and shall not be binding on the City Council.
(e)
Notice of City Council public hearing. At least 15 but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the public hearing before the City Council, the Zoning Administrator shall cause to be published within a newspaper of general circulation within the territorial boundaries of the city a notice of the public hearing on the application. The notice shall state the time, place, and purpose of the public hearing.
(f)
City Council public hearing and action. The City Council shall hold a public hearing on the application as advertised and after review and recommendation by the planning commission. In the event that the planning commission has not submitted its report and the public hearing has already been advertised, the City Council may elect to proceed with the advertised and scheduled public hearing, or it may reschedule and re-advertise the public hearing for a day after which the planning commission's recommendation will be available. In rendering a decision on any such application, the City Council shall consider all information supplied by the Zoning Administrator on the record and the findings of the planning commission, and any information submitted by the applicant. The City Council may grant or deny the appeal, or it may place conditions of approval on the application and approve the application the appeal with conditions. The applicant will be notified in writing by the Zoning Administrator of the decision within seven working days of the decision.
(g)
Stay of proceedings. The filing of an appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the City Council after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by any reason of acts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause eminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed.
(h)
Judicial review. Decisions by the City Council with regard to appeals are final; provided, however, any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the City Council with regard to a decision on an appeal application under the terms of this section may take an appeal to or seek judicial review by the county superior court.
