Secs. 16-1—16-18. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - PURCHASING POLICIES GENERALLY

Sec. 16-19. - Objective.
(a)
The city is funded by public funds and tax revenue. As such, the city has established purchasing policies and procedures to ensure the maximum efficiency and protection of the public trust. Where appropriate, the city uses competitive means for the purchase of all products and services whenever possible, and believes in open and fair competition; the city also prefers working relationships that are local to keep in line with the "buy local" motto of the county and its cities. The purchasing levels in these policies are subject to periodic review and may be changed with City Council approval based on inflation and other factors.
(b)
It is the policy of the city that all tax revenue received from any special-purpose local-option sales tax (SPLOST) cannot and will not be commingled with its general fund. When making purchases, the expenditures will be disbursed from their designated account. All revenues received by the city shall be deposited and held in the appropriate account fund for which they are designated.
(Code 2018, § 6.101)
Sec. 16-20. - Capital improvements.
(a)
$0.00 to $1,000.00. For purchases of $1,000.00 or less, any department head or his designated appointee may complete purchases for any necessary item without the necessity of City Council approval or competitive bid processes.
(b)
$1,000.01 to $9,999.99. Except in situations requiring emergency repairs or purchases covered in section 16-27, any purchase in excess of $1,000.00 but below $10,000.00 must have a minimum of three bids sought by the City Clerk, Mayor, or a department head. Bids must be in writing or recorded by the City Clerk, including the date, time, and person providing the estimate, and are subject to approval of the City Council prior to purchase.
(c)
$10,000.00 to $19,999.99. Except in situations requiring emergency repairs or purchases covered in section 16-27, any purchase $10,000.00 or more but below $20,000.00 must undergo a public bidding process including adoption of a formal request for proposals advertised in the official organ of the county. All bids must be written and maintained for no less than three years. The purchase will require City Council approval.
(d)
$20,000.00 or more. Any capital project (any purchase other than for city inventory) $20,000.00 or more requires a formal bid process which will include proper specifications of the project before bids are sought, for a fair and equivalent bid opportunity. The required service and/or materials will be formally bid upon, and all bids will be presented to the City Council at a Council work session for discussion, review, and analysis. After scrutiny, the City Council will vote to accept or reject the proposals at the formal Council meeting. If a bid is approved, only then will the project move forward.
(Code 2018, § 6.102)
Sec. 16-21. - Purchases for city inventory.
The City Clerk, Mayor, and department heads will strive to obtain as many bids as possible for purchases of city inventory (equipment, vehicles, supplies, etc.) over $10,000.00; however, the city recognizes that many items will be "one of a kind," or a vehicle that can only be found at one place. In such instances, approval of the purchase can be considered with only one bid. The bid or bids will be presented to the City Council at the Council work session; any changes or recommendations they make will be acted upon to their satisfaction. The City Council will vote to accept or reject the bid for the item at the formal Council meeting.
(Code 2018, § 6.103)
Sec. 16-22. - Source selection process.
This process will be utilized for special projects where the final selection is of a complex or highly technical nature, not simply a matter of accepting the lowest bid. For these types of projects, an open, objective, and unbiased selection process may be designed. Individuals from various disciplines and areas of expertise may be consulted with the goal of developing specifications, if necessary.
(Code 2018, § 6.104)
Sec. 16-23. - Trade-in.
Requests for trade-ins will be considered if the equipment cannot be transferred to another department, or sold for more than the trade-in value. If a trade-in is allowed, the department should show on a report a description of the equipment to include the year of manufacture, model number, serial number, and condition.
(Code 2018, § 6.105)
Sec. 16-24. - Maintenance and service agreements.
(a)
Maintenance contracts are negotiated as new equipment is acquired and may be renewed on a yearly basis. It is the responsibility of the City Clerk or the department head to review and renew this contract. It is not an automatic process.
(b)
Service agreements, such as pest control and security systems, are similar. It is the responsibility of the department head to provide a copy of the maintenance and/or service agreement to the City Clerk. A copy must be on file with the City Clerk.
(Code 2018, § 6.106)
Sec. 16-25. - Vehicle and equipment maintenance purchases.
Day-to-day vehicle and equipment maintenance purchases are a function of the city shop. The maintenance supervisor or his designee is authorized to purchase any parts, labor, and other services that may be required for the repair and maintenance of city vehicles, equipment, and city structures. All receipts must be returned to the City Clerk. The city maintenance supervisor is authorized to make decisions for maintenance work that fall within the scope of this purchasing policy and remain within the city budget for day-to-day maintenance, and/or work necessitated for safety reasons or hazardous situations. Emergency purchases may be made in accordance with the procedures set forth herein for same.
(Code 2018, § 6.107)
Sec. 16-26. - Criteria for bid selection.

The city reserves the right to investigate the financial responsibility of any and all bidders to determine the ability of the bidder to ensure service throughout the term of the contract.
(Code 2018, § 6.108)
Sec. 16-27. - Emergency purchasing procedures.

(b)
If the situation is deemed an emergency by the City Clerk and/or the Mayor, the City Clerk or the Mayor may proceed with the purchase without the approval of the City Council, but must report the expense along with a detailed explanation of the emergency to the City Council at the next Council work session or formal Council meeting, whichever is first.
