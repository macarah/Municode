Sec. 34-380. - Administrative variances.
(a)
Intent. It is the intent of this section to provide the Zoning Administrator with authority to grant relief to applicants in the form of administrative variances as specified and limited in this section. This grant of authority shall not be construed to be an obligation by the Zoning Administrator to grant such relief.
(b)
Application. Applications for an administrative variance shall require submittal of an application fee, completed application form, adequate property description, and supporting materials as may be specified by the Zoning Administrator. No application for administrative variance shall be processed by the Zoning Administrator unless it is found to be complete with regard to application materials, payment of fees, and submission of any specified supportive materials. The Zoning Administrator may require a boundary survey and/or as-built survey of improvements prepared by a registered land surveyor, if necessary to determine the exact amount of administrative variance applied for or to be granted. Upon submission, the Zoning Administrator shall have up to seven business days to determine if the application for administrative variance is complete.
(c)
Discretionary notice. At the sole discretion of the Zoning Administrator, written notice to adjacent property owners of the proposed application for administrative variance, or the posting of a notice sign on the property, may but shall not be required to be provided. The Zoning Administrator shall consider the nature of land uses and development abutting the subject site, and the potential impact of such administrative variance on abutting properties if granted, in determining whether to require written notice to adjacent property owners or the posting of a notice sign on the property. If the Zoning Administrator elects to provide notice of the application, such notice shall be provided as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than seven business days from determining the application complete. The Zoning Administrator shall consider but shall not be bound by any comments received by any parties commenting on the application.
(d)
Decision. The Zoning Administrator shall make a decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application within seven business days from determining an application for administrative variance is complete, if no discretionary notice is provided. In the case discretionary notice is provided, the Zoning Administrator shall not make a decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application until after at least ten business days but not more than 15 business days following the date discretionary notice was mailed or posted, to allow time for interested parties to comment. If an application for administrative variance is denied by the Zoning Administrator, the applicant may apply for a full variance from the Nicholson City Council pursuant to section 34-260 of this chapter.
(e)
Criteria. The Zoning Administrator shall consider one or more of the following criteria, as may be appropriate, in making a decision on applications for administrative variances:
(1)
Whether there are extraordinary and exceptional conditions or practical difficulties pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district, that give supporting grounds for the requested relief.
(2)
Whether granting the administrative variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privilege that is denied any other similarly zoned or situated property.
(3)
Whether the requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare.
(4)
Whether the variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the proposed use of the land, building, or structure in the zoning district in which the development is located.
(f)
Findings and written decision. The Zoning Administrator shall adopt findings in support of the decision on the administrative variance application, with reference to the criteria specified in this section, and shall issue the decision in writing to the applicant with written copy to any interested parties that have provided written comment on said application.
(g)
Regulations that can be administratively varied. The Zoning Administrator's authority to grant administrative variances shall be limited to the following regulations:
(1)
Minimum building setbacks (including natural buffer if required) for principal buildings and structures, not to exceed a reduction of 25 percent of the zoning district requirement.

(6)
Reduction of minimum lot width, but only to allow a single lot to be split into two lots, not to exceed a width reduction of 20 feet.
(7)
