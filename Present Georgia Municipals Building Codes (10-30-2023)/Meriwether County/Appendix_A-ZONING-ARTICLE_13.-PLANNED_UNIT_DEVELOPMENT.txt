ARTICLE 13. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 13.1. - Purpose and objectives of zone.
It is the objective of this zone to establish procedures and standards for the implementation of comprehensively planned, multi-use projects. It is also intended that this zone provide a more flexible approach to the comprehensive design and development of multi-use projects than the procedures and regulations applicable under the various conventional zoning categories. In so doing, it is intended that this zoning category be utilized to foster an overall improved development pattern for Meriwether County. The specific purposes of the zone are:
(1)
To encourage orderly, staged development of comprehensively planned, multi-use centers by providing procedures for various zoning and plan approvals, including development phasing;
(2)
To encourage design flexibility and coordination of architectural style of buildings and signage;
(3)
To ensure the integration and internal compatibility of applicable residential and nonresidential uses by providing a suitable residential environment that is enhanced and complemented by commercial, recreational, open space, employment and institutional uses and amenities within all land use components of the multi-use project;
(4)
To ensure compatibility of the proposed land uses with internal and surrounding uses by incorporating higher standards of land planning and site design than could be accomplished under conventional zoning categories and to provide a superior quality of development exceeding what could be achieved under conventional zoning regulations and procedures;
(5)
To encourage the efficient use of land by locating employment and retail uses convenient to residential areas; reducing reliance on automobile use and encouraging pedestrian and other non-vehicular circulation systems; retaining and providing usable open space and active recreation areas close to employment and residential population; and providing for the development of comprehensive non-vehicular circulation networks, separated from vehicular roadways, which constitute a system of linkages among residential areas, open spaces, recreational areas, commercial and employment areas, and public facilities;
(6)
To provide a superior natural environment by the preservation of trees, natural topographic geologic features, wetlands, watercourses, and open space; and
(7)
To allow development only in a staged or phased fashion to ensure the adequacy for the provision of public facilities and the concurrent implementation of community amenities.

Sec. 13.2. - Size, location and requirements.
The PUD zoning classification and accompanying development plans may be approved upon findings that the application is proper for the comprehensive and systemic development of the county, is capable of accomplishing the purposes of this zone, is an internally and externally compatible form of development and is consistent with any applicable planning and land use policies of the county. In order to enable the county to evaluate the conformance with the standards contained herein, specific sets of plans shall be submitted in accordance with section 13.9 herein, and the county is authorized to approve said plan or plans if such plans are found sufficient to accomplish the above purposes in compliance with the standards and requirements of this zone.
(1)
Minimum size, location, and development requirements.
a.
Minimum area. No land shall be classified in the PUD zone unless it contains a minimum of 600 acres. Parcels or tracts less than the minimum acreage may be permitted if they are contiguous to an existing PUD-zoned area and may be harmoniously integrated into the PUD area, consistent with the objectives and purposes of this zone.
b.
Location. Such land shall be located adjacent to and readily accessible from existing or planned roadways, sufficient to carry the increased capacity of the development, and are in an approved construction program. It is intended that adequate access be available to such sites so that traffic does not have an adverse impact on the surrounding area or cause internal circulation or safety problems.
c.
Public water and sewer. No development shall be permitted unless served by public water and sewer owned and operated by a municipality or the developer. An escrow account must be established by the developer equal to 100 percent of the value of the system with funds available to repair or replace the system as required.
d.
Signage. Signs shall be allowed in accordance with the specifications and standards established in the final site plan and the Meriwether County Sign Ordinance.
e.
Connectivity. Parcels shall not be zoned as PUD unless configured to connect to adjacent streets and promote the overall connectivity for pedestrians and vehicles within the development.
f.
Large undeveloped land tracts. Large undeveloped land tracts within the county shall be considered for the PUD zone in order for the county to be planned in a more comprehensive and less piecemeal manner. Large tracts of land should be zoned PUD to include a mix of land uses instead of being developed under one conventional zoning category in order to meet the purposes and objectives of this zone.
( Ord. No. 2020-04, ยง 1(Exh. A), 8-25-2020 )
Sec. 13.3. - Traditional neighborhood development principles.
Land developed in the PUD zone should be developed consistent with the principles of traditional neighborhood developments, which emulate the historic pattern of development in the county and will be generally more compatible with existing developed areas of the county. These principles are listed below:
(1)
Walkability. Most daily needs can be satisfied within a five- to ten-minute walk of home and work (quarter- to half-mile radius). Pedestrian-friendly street design includes buildings close to the street, front porches, continuous tree cover, on-street parking, hidden parking lots, garages relegated to a rear lane, and narrow, slow speed vehicular trajectories.
(2)
Connectivity. An interconnected street grid network disperses traffic and increases walkability by allowing most streets to be narrow. A high-quality pedestrian network and public realm makes walking comfortable, pleasant, and interesting.
(3)
Mixed-use. A mix of shops, offices, apartments, houses, and recreation on-site. Mixed-uses within the neighborhood, the block, and buildings.
(4)
Diverse housing. A range of architectural types, sizes, and prices located in close proximity.
(5)
High-quality architecture and urban design. Emphasis on aesthetics, human comfort, and creating a sense of place. Special placement of civic buildings and sites within the community. Architectural styles and exteriors shall vary but no more than 25 percent of the total dwelling units shall be constructed as vinyl or metal siding.
(6)
Increased density. More buildings, residences, shops, and services closer together, to encourage walking and to enable a more efficient use of resources and time.
(7)
Smart transportation. A transportation network connecting neighborhoods, business districts, cities and towns together. Pedestrian-friendly design encourages a greater use of walking, bicycles, rollerblades, and scooters as daily transportation.
(8)
Sustainable. Minimal environmental impact of development and its operations. It has less use of finite land and fuel resources, and more local production.
(9)
Quality of life. Taken together, all of the above contribute to an improved quality of life for community residents and for the human community as a whole.
( Ord. No. 2020-04, ยง 1(Exh. A), 8-25-2020 )
Sec. 13.4. - Uses permitted.
(a)
Residential. All types of residential uses allowed by right in the R-1 zoning district shall be permitted, as well as all accessory uses thereto.
(1)
The location and type of all residential uses proposed on the site must be shown on the plan submitted in accordance with the requirements of section 13.9 of this article, with the level of specificity increasing at each level of plan review.
(2)
Residential uses may be mixed with proposed commercial industrial uses, rather than located in a separate residential area on the site, upon a finding by the county commission that combining residential and nonresidential uses at one location, within a site, will not adversely affect the overall development proposed.
(b)
Commercial/industrial.
(1)
All uses allowed by right or by special exception in the NHC zone are permitted uses, except for the following uses, which are specifically prohibited:
a.
Manufacture, compounding, and processing of goods and articles.

(3)
In order to establish and appropriately mix character within the entire PUD-zoned area, a mixture of commercial uses including retail commercial, office institutional and other low-intensity uses shall not exceed 30 percent, including parking and landscaping of the total project shown on a sketch plan.
( Ord. No. 2020-04, ยง 1(Exh. A), 8-25-2020 )
Sec. 13.5. - Density and intensity of development.
(a)
Residential. The total number of dwelling units and the corresponding density, as well as the approximate location of such units, shall be established at the time of sketch plan approval pursuant to section 13.4(a) of this ordinance.
(b)

(a)
The amount of green area, including designated parks, public and private open space, and active and passive recreational areas required for the residential portion of a mixed-use development shall not be less than 35 percent of the total area shown for residential use. The minimum green area requirement, which shall include designated parks, private open space, and active and passive recreational areas, for the commercial/industrial portion of a mixed-use development shall be not less than 25 percent of the total area devoted to commercial uses, except that comparable amenities and/or facilities may be provided in lieu of green area if the planning commission determines that such amenities or facilities are sufficient to accomplish the purposes of the zone, and would be more beneficial to the proposed development than strict adherence to the specific green area requirement.
(b)
All recreation areas, facilities and amenities and all open space and landscaped areas shall be reflected on the application for a PUD zone and site plan approved by the planning commission. With respect to such areas, facilities and amenities, the site plan or accompanying documents shall reflect:

That such areas, facilities or amenities shall not be constructed, converted or used for any purposes other than reflected and designated on the site plan unless said plan is amended by prior written consent of the planning commission.
(2)
A staging or construction timetable specifying the construction of all recreational areas, facilities and amenities. The staging or construction timetable may be related to the number of residential units under construction or complete, or population levels, or other appropriate standards. The adherence to the performance of such timetable may, at the discretion of the board of commissioners, be secured by an appropriate bond, letter of credit or security acceptable to the county or by the withholding and suspension of all permits for any project lying within the designated PUD zone. Subsequent to the completion of work, the county manager is authorized to declare as abandoned and forfeited any cash bond posted pursuant to a requirement of this chapter, and to relinquish proceeds thereof to the general treasury of the county, when, after giving the applicant or permittee who posted the cash bond 30 days' written notice first by registered mall, and if unclaimed, by first class mail. Upon failure to request of the county the return of the cash bond as provided herein, the applicant or permittee, its successors, heirs and assigns relinquish all claims to said bond.
