ARTICLE 10. - MANUFACTURED HOMES AND MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS

Sec. 10.1. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to provide standards and regulations to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of Meriwether County. Meriwether County recognizes that manufactured housing meets the needs of many county residents for affordable housing and is compatible with site-built housing if developed in accordance with comparable standards. These regulations shall govern the use and operation of all manufactured homes on single lots or within manufactured home parks used for permanent residential occupancy, as well as recreational vehicle parks used for temporary occupancy, in unincorporated Meriwether County, Georgia. It is the intent of these regulations to empower the Meriwether County Planning Commission, the Meriwether County Health Department, and the community development office to review the development of manufactured home sites, manufactured home parks, and recreational vehicle parks within the unincorporated areas of Meriwether County for compliance with standards as stated in this ordinance.
( Ord. No. 2020-04, § 1(Exh. A), 8-25-2020 )
Sec. 10.2. - Manufactured homes.
(a)
Nonconforming use. Nonconforming mobile/manufactured home parks lawfully existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance may be continued, but if such nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of 90 days, the manufactured home park shall be made to conform with the requirements of these regulations prior to its being occupied again. Any expansion or addition to an existing manufactured home park shall be in compliance with these regulations, as amended.
(b)
Issuance of permit. Any owner of a manufactured home, whether locating or relocating said manufactured home, shall obtain a permit from the community development office of Meriwether County indicating compliance with all applicable codes before any person or persons are authorized to occupy any newly installed manufactured home.

Permit application procedures. A manufactured home permit to move a manufactured home into or within the county shall not be issued until the following conditions have been met in accordance with established administrative procedures:
(1)
All manufactured homes located in Meriwether County shall be no more than ten years old at the time of placement in the county.
(2)
All manufactured homes must be located at an approved manufactured home space, or in an approved manufactured home park, subject to the requirements of this ordinance.

To that end, no manufactured home shall be allowed to locate or relocate for permanent or temporary occupancy in this county unless that manufactured home complies with the minimum construction standards required by HUD, which compliance must be evidenced by the affixation of a permanent label or tag certifying the compliance. Manufactured homes that do not display certification compliance shall not be eligible for a Meriwether County building and/or occupancy permit. Any manufactured home in Meriwether County that legally exists at the time of adoption of this ordinance that does display certification compliance shall not be required to have certification. However, any manufactured home that does not display certification shall be considered a nonconforming structure and shall not be relocated to any other site within the county.
