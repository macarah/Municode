In forming an opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the department head will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of the subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, the materials of construction of the sewers, the nature of the sewage treatment process, the capacity of the sewage treatment plant, the degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The substances prohibited are:
1.
Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than one hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit, sixty-five (65) degrees Celsius;
2.
Wastewater containing more than twenty-five (25) milligrams per liter of petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oils, or products of mineral oil origin; or wastewater from industrial or commercial plants containing more than one hundred (100) milligrams per liter of floatable oils, fats or grease, or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between thirty-two (32) and one hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit, zero and sixty-five (65) degrees Celsius;
3.
Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. Garbage grinders may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, institutions, restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments or similar places where garbage originates from the preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of consumption on the premises or when served by caterers;
4.
Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling wastes or concentrated plating solutions, whether neutralized or not;
5.

6.
Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste-producing or odor-producing substances in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be established by the superintendent as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal or other public garbage agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters;
7.
Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the department head in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;
8.
Any waters or wastes containing a toxic or poisonous substance in sufficient quantity to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans and animals or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the sewage treatment plant;
9.
Materials which exert or cause:
a.
Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, fullers earth, lime slurries and lime residues) or of dissolved solids such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate,
b.
Excessive discoloration such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions,
c.
Unusual BOD, above three hundred (300) milligrams per liter, chemical oxygen demand or chlorine requirement in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works.
d.
Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting slugs;
10.
Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment process employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters;
11.
Waters or wastes containing suspended solids in excess of three hundred (300) milligrams per liter;
12.
Wastewaters at a flow rate or containing concentrations or quantities of pollutants that exceed for any period longer than fifteen (15) minutes more than five times the average twenty-four (24) hour concentrations, quantities or flows during normal operation and that would cause a treatment process upset and subsequent loss of treatment efficiency.
E.
Procedure Upon Discharge or Proposed Discharge of Certain Prohibited Wastes. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (D) of this section, and which in the judgment of the superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the department head may take any action necessary to:
1.
Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater;
2.
Require a discharger to demonstrate that in-plant modifications will reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity with this chapter;
3.
Require pretreatment, including storage facilities or flow equalization, necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics or substances so that the discharge will not violate these rules and regulations;
4.
Require the person making, causing or allowing the discharge to pay any additional cost or expense incurred by the city for handling and treating excess loads imposed on the treatment system;
5.
Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be desirable or necessary to achieve the purpose of this chapter.
When considering the above alternatives, the department head shall give consideration to the economic impact of each alternative on the discharger. If the department head permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the department head. All industrial contributors proposing to discharge other than domestic sanitary wastes to the municipal system shall comply with pretreatment regulations set forth in 40 CFR 128 of the Federal Register, dated November 8, 1973.

All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the department head and shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal, which are subject to review by the department head. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by the owner's personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.
