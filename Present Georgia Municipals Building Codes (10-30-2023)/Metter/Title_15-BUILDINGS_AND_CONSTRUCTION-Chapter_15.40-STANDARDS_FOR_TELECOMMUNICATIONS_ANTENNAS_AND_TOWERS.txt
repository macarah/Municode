Sections:

15.40.010 - Purposes.
The purposes of the ordinance codified in this chapter are to:
A.
Provide for the appropriate location and development of communication towers and antennas to serve the residents and businesses of the city of Metter;
B.
Minimize adverse visual impacts of towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
C.
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures;
D.
Lessen traffic impacts on surrounding residential areas;
E.
Maximize use of any new and existing communication towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city;
F.
Maximize and encourage use of alternative tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and
G.
Encourage and promote the location of new communication towers in areas which are not zoned for residential use.
(Ord. 99-14 (part))
15.40.020 - Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
"Alternative tower structure" means manmade structures such as clock towers, bell towers, church steeples, water towers, light poles and similar alternative-design mounting structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas and towers.
"Antenna" means an exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio or television communications through the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves.
"Director" means the Metter building inspector.
"FAA" means the Federal Aviation Administration.
"FCC" means the Federal Communications Commission.
"Governing body" means the city council for the city of Metter.
"Guy towers" means a communication tower that is supported, in whole or in part, by guy wires and ground anchors.
"Height," when referring to a tower, antennas or other structure, means the distance measured vertically from the highest point when positioned for operation to the lowest point which is defined as the bottom of the base of the structure being measured at either roof or ground level, whichever is applicable. The height of a tower shall include the height of any antennas positioned for operation attached or which may be attached to the highest point on the tower.
"Lattice" or "self-supporting tower" means a communication tower that has open-framed supports on three or four sides and is constructed without guy wires and ground anchors.
"Monopole tower" means a communications tower consisting of a single pole, constructed without guy wires or ground anchors.
"Tower" means a structure, such as self-supporting lattice tower, guy tower or monopole tower, constructed as a freestanding structure or in association with a building, other permanent structure or equipment, on which is located one or more antennas intended for transmitting or receiving television, AM/FM radio, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, or similar forms of electric communication. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common carriers towers, and cellular telephone towers. The term excludes any tower and antenna under seventy (70) feet in total height and owned and operated by an amateur radio operator licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, and satellite earth station antenna one meter in diameter or less, any receive-only home television antenna, and any satellite earth station antenna two meters or less in diameter which is located in a commercial or industrial zoning district.

(Ord. 99-14 (part))
15.40.040 - General requirements.
The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this chapter.
A.
Building Codesâ€”Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of communication towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. Tower owners shall conduct periodic inspections of communication towers at least once every three years to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the director.
B.
Regulatory Compliance.
1.
All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the communications towers and antennas governed by this chapter shall bring such communications towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency.
2.
Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communication tower is in compliance with all federal requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every twelve (12) months.
C.
Security. Communication towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, the director or the governing body may waive such requirements for alternative tower structures.
D.
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction, in which case the director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
E.
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower.
F.
Visual Impact.
1.
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
2.
At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and building environment.
3.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
4.
Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design.
5.
Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower.
G.
Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows:
1.
For towers one hundred fifty (150) feet tall or less, a buffer area no less than six feet wide shall commence at the property line.
2.
For towers more than one hundred fifty (150) feet tall, a buffer area not less than ten (10) feet wide shall be provided at the property line.
3.
The buffer zone is to consist of materials of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet in height within two years of planting.
4.
Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed twenty (20) feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff/maintenance.
5.
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
6.
In lieu of these standards, the director may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions of this section, except as lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the director.
H.
Maintenance Impacts and Parking Requirements. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector and local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector street. A minimum of two parking spaces shall be provided on each site; an additional parking space for each two employees shall be provided at facilities which require on-site personnel.
I.
Principal, Accessory and Joint Uses.
1.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicles storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made.
2.
Towers may be located on sites containing another principal uses in the same buildable area. As long as all of the other siting, setback, separation and general requirements of this chapter are met, towers may occupy a parcel meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. The minimum distance between a tower and other principal use located on the same lot shall be for a monopole or lattice tower the greater of twenty (20) percent of the tower height or twenty-five (25) feet and for a guy tower the greater of one hundred (100) breakpoint or twenty-five (25) feet. This separation is required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site.
3.
Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals.
J.
Tower Lot Size, Setbacks and Separation.
1.
The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property or public street. Such setback shall be sufficient to:
a.
Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as required in Section 15.40.040 (F) and (G);
b.
Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property;
c.
Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in Section 15.40.060.
2.
A site is presumed to be of sufficient size when it:
a.
Meets the requirements of the subsection (J)(1) of this section;
b.
Provides a setback equal to two times the height of the tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in Section 15.40.060;
c.
Provides a setback equal to or exceeding the rear yard setback required for the adjoining property where the adjoining property is not in a residential district nor a public property or a public street.
3.
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted; provided, all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible; provided, tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
4.
For a guyed structure, the site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide a setback equal to at least the height of the tower from a guy anchor to any property line abutting a residential district, public property or public street in addition to the size required to comply with subsection (J)(2) of this section. Such setback shall be adequate to provide a vegetative, topographic or other buffer sufficient to obscure view to the anchor from such adjoining properties.
5.
All structures and uses associated with the transmission use other than the transmission tower shall be located to meet the setbacks required in the zoning district where the tower is to be located. To encourage and accommodate shared use of a tower, the director may waive or reduce setback requirements by up to twenty-five (25) percent to accommodate the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment at a tower site.
6.
No freestanding communication tower shall be allowed within a five thousand (5,000) foot radius of an existing tower within a residential area.
7.
In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard of a residential district.
8.
All freestanding towers constructed after April 12, 1999, shall conform to the following minimum tower separation requirements:
EXPAND
TOWER
HEIGHT <50 feet 50â€”100 feet 101â€”150 feet >150 feet
<50 feet 300' 500' 750' 1,000'
50â€”100 feet 500' 750' 1,000' 1,500'
101â€”150 feet 750' 1,000' 1,500' 2,000'
>150 feet 1,000' 1,500' 2,000' 2,500'
  Towers and antennas mounted on rooftops or alternative tower structures shall be exempt from these minimum separation distances.
K.
Be it ordained that the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter also includes the adoption of Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and that all placement of towers and antenna must be approved by the FAA before a building permit or placement is allowed. This approval is generally granted by the completion of form "FAA Form 7460-1" or its equivalent.
(Ord. 99-14 (part))
15.40.050 - Shared use.
All new towers shall be designed to structurally accommodate the maximum number of additional users technically practicable.
A.
1. Once a new tower is approved, additional antennas and accompanying accessory uses may be added to it in accordance with the approved share plan if the director finds that the standards of this chapter are met; or
2.
To encourage shared use of towers, no building permit or special use permit shall be required for the addition of antenna(e) to an existing tower so long as the height of the tower or structure on which the antenna is placed is not increased and the requirements of Sections 15.40.030(B) and 15.40.040 are met.
B.
If a new tower is approved, the owner shall be required as conditions of approval, to:
1.
Record the letter of intent required by Section 15.40.060(J) in miscellaneous deed records of the office of the county clerk of superior court where the tower site is located;
2.
Respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for information from a potential shared use applicant;
3.
Negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties; and
4.
Allow shared use where the third party seeking such agrees in writing to pay reasonable, pro rata charges for sharing, including all charges necessary to modify the tower and transmitters to accommodate shared use, but not total tower reconstruction, and to observe whatever technical requirements are necessary to allow shared use without creating interference.
C.
Wilful, knowing failure of an owner whose tower was approved after the effective date of this chapter, to comply with the requirement of subsections (B)(1) through (B)(4) shall be grounds for withholding approval of any application by such owner for a building permit or special use permit for any tower or antenna.
D.
Such conditions shall run with the land and be binding on subsequent purchasers of the tower site.
(Ord. 99-14 (part))
15.40.060 - Conditional zoning.
A.
A request for a conditional zoning shall be initiated by application to the director and handled in accordance with the conditional zoning provision of Article XII, Board of Zoning Appeals, in the zoning regulations. The city council may grant a conditional zoning under this section; provided, it shall have determined that all of the general requirements of Section 15.40.040 have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties.
B.
In granting a conditional zoning, the city council may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties.
(Ord. 99-14 (part), 1999)
15.40.070 - Application procedures.
Application for a building permit for any communication tower or use of an alternative tower structure shall be made to the director. An application will not be considered until it is complete. A complete application must contain the following:
A.
Inventory of Existing Sites. An inventory of the applicant's existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height and design of each tower. The director may share information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that the director is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable;
B.
Site plan or plans to scale specifying the location of tower(s), guy anchors (if any), transmission building and/or other accessory uses, access, parking, fences, landscaped areas, and adjacent land uses;
C.
Landscape plan to scale indicating size, spacing and type of plantings required in Section 15.40.040(G);
D.
Utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage and power lines impacting the proposed tower site;
E.
An environment impact statement fully describing the effect that the proposed tower and/or antenna will have on the environment and surrounding area including the radiological impact on human health, impacts on adjacent residential structures and districts, impacts on structures and sites of historic significance and impacts on streetscapes;
F.
A certified statement prepared by an engineer licensed to practice in Georgia that the construction of the tower, including reception and transmission functions, will not interfere with the usual and customary transmission or reception of radio, television, etc., service enjoyed by adjacent properties;
G.
A description of anticipated maintenance needs, including frequency of service, personnel needs, equipment needs, and traffic, noise or safety impacts of such maintenance.
H.
Report from a professional structural engineer licensed in the state of Georgia, documenting the following:
1.
Tower height and design, including technical, engineering, economic, and other pertinent factors governing selection of the proposed design. A cross-section of the tower structure shall be included,
2.
Total anticipated capacity of the structure, including number and types of antennas which can be accommodated,
3.
Evidence of structural integrity of the tower structure,
4.
Failure characteristics of the tower and demonstration that site and setbacks are of adequate size to contain debris;
I.
Written statements from the FAA, FCC and any appropriate state review authority stating that the proposed tower complies with regulations administered by that agency or that the tower is exempt from those regulations;
J.
Letter of intent to lease excess space on the tower structure and to lease additional excess land on the tower site when the shared use potential of the tower is absorbed, if structurally and technically possible;
K.
A reasonable pro rata charge may be made for shared use, consistent with an appropriate sharing of construction, financing and maintenance costs. Fees may also be charged for any structural or RF changes necessitated by such shared use. Such sharing shall be a condition of approval as granted.
1.
The applicant shall describe what range of charges are reasonably expected to be assessed against shared users,
2.
The applicant shall base charges on generally accepted accounting principles and shall explain the elements included in the charge;
L.
The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate number and types of antennas. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses, e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. The director shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means;
M.
Evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna;
N.
Each applicant must make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing or planned towers can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna/transmitter as described below:
1.
The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of a height roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed by the applicant. A list shall be provided of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, and the form and content of such contact,
2.
Such contact shall be made in a timely manner, that is, sufficiently before the filing of an application for a building or conditional zoning to include a response into the application when filed.
a.
Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant if a timely, good faith effort was made to obtain one. However, where an existing or planned tower is known to have capacity for additional antennas of the sort proposed, based on the decision regarding such tower, that application for a new tower shall not be complete until the owner of the existing or planned tower responds. Such response is to be required as a condition of approval;
b.
The director shall maintain and provide, on request, records of responses from each tower,
c.
Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on the owner's tower as described below, the owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennas of the sort proposed;
3.
The applicant shall request the following information from each tower contacted:
a.
Identification of the site by location, tax lot number, existing uses and tower height,
b.
Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring structural changes be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each such owner with the height, length, weight, and other relevant data about the proposed antenna,
c.
Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural changes were made, not including totally rebuilding the tower. If so, the owner shall specify in general terms what structural changes would be required,
d.
If structurally able, would shared use by such existing tower be precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner shall describe in general terms what changes in either the existing or proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the proposed tower, if at all,
e.
If shared use is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower would charge for such shared use;
4.
Shared use is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary to adopt the existing and proposed uses to a shared tower. The director and the governing body may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee and costs are reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable;
O.
Any other information which may be requested by the director to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed tower and/or antenna.
(Ord. 99-14 (part))
15.40.080 - Appeals.
Appeals from any decision of the director shall be to the mayor and city council. Appeals from any decision of the governing body shall be made to the superior court within thirty (30) days of the decision. Any decision on a request to build a tower or for a conditional zoning for a tower shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence in a written record.
(Ord. 99-14 (part))
15.40.090 - Removal of antenna and towers.
All towers and antennas shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such towers. If upon inspection by the director such tower is determined not to comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower and the owner of the property if such owner is different, such owners shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance. In the event such tower or antenna is not brought into compliance within thirty (30) days, the city may provide notice to the owners requiring the tower or antenna to be removed. In the event such tower or antenna is not removed within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice, the city may remove such tower or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that communication towers and antenna not in compliance with the code standards or which constitute danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The city may seek to have the tower or antenna removed regardless of the owners' or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.
(Ord. 99-14 (part))
15.40.100 - Abandoned towers.
A.
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of the tower. The owner of an abandoned antenna or tower and the owner of the property where the tower is located shall be under a duty to remove such a tower or antenna. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the city may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that abandoned communication towers and antenna are removed. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may seek to have the communication tower or antenna removed regardless of the owners or operators intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.
B.
If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this chapter as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna.
(Ord. 99-14 (part))
15.40.110 - Pre-existing towersâ€”Nonconforming uses.
A.
All communications towers operative on April 12, 1999 shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a nonconforming use in accordance with the zoning regulations. Routine maintenance, including replacement with a new tower of like construction and height, shall be permitted on such existing towers. New construction other than routine maintenance on an existing communication tower shall comply with the requirements of this chapter.
B.
A communication tower that has received city approval in the form of either a building permit or conditional zoning exception, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation, shall be considered an existing tower so long as such approval is current and not expired.
(Ord. 99-14 (part))
15.40.120 - Public property.
Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the governing authority shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter; provided, a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the governing body.
(Ord. 99-14 (part))
