ARTICLE IV. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT[2]

Footnotes:
--- (2) ---
State Law reference— Giving massages in places used for lewdness, prostitution, assignation or masturbation for hire, O.C.G.A. § 16-6-17; governing authority has power to enact legislation to restrict operation of adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, and adult movie houses to areas zoned for commercial or industrial purposes, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3; establishment, maintenance or use of building, structure or place for unlawful sexual purposes, O.C.G.A. § 41-3-1.

Sec. 6-144. - Purpose.
(a)
Based on city officials' review of information regarding establishments that exploit live human nudity and human sexuality for commercial profit, euphemistically referred to as "adult entertainment," and the experiences of other urban cities and counties, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas; Manatee County, Florida; the State of Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Phoenix, Arizona, and as further described in City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 120 S. Ct 1382 (2000), which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before the mayor and council, the mayor and council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of live human nudity and human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within the country.
(b)
The mayor and council expressly find that the negative effects of adult entertainment are not limited to adult entertainment that offers live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts. Other forms of adult entertainment also have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in nearby neighborhoods and commercial districts and on urban life in general Such other forms of adult entertainment include, but are not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters, adult gift or novelty shops, and lingerie modeling studios.
(c)
Further, based on the investigation conducted by the city regarding lingerie modeling studios, it is the finding of the mayor and council that lingerie modeling studios are establishments that offer adult entertainment in the form of live human nudity in a private setting. Based on the evidence presented to the mayor and council, it is apparent that lingerie modeling studios, by providing adult entertainment in a private setting, lead to criminal behavior, including, but not limited to, masturbation for hire, prostitution, and sodomy.
(d)
Furthermore, based on the investigation conducted by the city, it is apparent that lingerie modeling studios pose a more difficult challenge to the enforcement of regulations pertaining to adult entertainment business, in that the activity occurs within a private setting, as opposed to in an open area which is visible to all patrons of the establishment. The mayor and council have determined that lighting, visibility and access are measures that can reduce the risk of crime to patrons and others.
(e)
Accordingly, the mayor and council find that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to limit and regulate adult entertainment within the corporate boundaries of the city, so as to limit the adverse impact on property values, other business uses, residential uses and public and semi-public uses; to ensure that adult entertainment uses and adult entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; to restrict adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily-used public pedestrian areas; and to protect patrons of adult entertainment business from unreasonable risk of crime.
(f)
After giving due consideration to the considerations stated in these findings and the current state of growth and development of the city, the mayor and council find that the area zoned M Manufacturing is so situated as to provide sufficient vehicular access to patrons and suppliers, while providing the desired containment from residential uses and pedestrian traffic, regarding adult entertainment facilities and adult entertainment businesses.
(g)
This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression. This article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of providers and patrons of adult entertainment.
(h)
It is a matter of governmental interest and concern and in the interest of the public welfare to minimize the proliferation of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that commercially exploit human sexuality through adult entertainment to limit adult entertainment uses of property to certain prescribed areas of the city. To that end, the ordinance from which this article is derived is hereby adopted.
