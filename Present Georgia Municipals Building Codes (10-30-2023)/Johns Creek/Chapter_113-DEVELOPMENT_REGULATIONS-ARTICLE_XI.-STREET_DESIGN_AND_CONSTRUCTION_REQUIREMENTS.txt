ARTICLE XI. - STREET DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 113-121. - General.
(1)
General requirements.
a.
The sections enumerated in this article are guidelines, and are intended to be benchmark indicators of what standards could be acceptable. They are further intended to allow alternate designs which could produce results similar to these performance standards and similar protection to the public. The objective of these performance standards is not to suggest a single methodological standard of acceptance exclusive of all others. Rather they establish what would otherwise be allowed in the absence of an acceptable alternative.
b.
All new streets proposed to be constructed in a subdivision or other development, whether to be public or private, shall be designed and constructed to the standards contained in these regulations and in accordance with the classification of said street.
c.
Streets, whether existing or new, shall be constructed or improved under those circumstances and to the standards as established in these regulations. Roadway improvements shall be in accordance with the street classifications as shown in the comprehensive plan, as may be amended, or the zoning ordinance, as applicable, or as otherwise required by the public works director.
(2)
Compliance with comprehensive plan or overlay districts. In cases where the city has developed alternate design criteria in the comprehensive plan or for specific areas covered under an overlay district, those design requirements shall be used in lieu of those provided herein.
(Ord. No. 2009-06-18, (11.1), 6-29-2009)
Sec. 113-122. - Specifications.
Unless otherwise specifically set forth herein, all of the materials, methods of construction, and workmanship for the work covered in reference to street construction shall conform to the latest specifications of GDOT.
(Ord. No. 2009-06-18, (11.2), 6-29-2009)
Sec. 113-123. - Access.
(1)
Arrangement of lots. When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets.
(2)
Access to adjacent properties—Inter-parcel access.
a.
No subdivision or development shall be designed so as to completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land. Every development shall be designed to facilitate access to adjoining properties which are developed or anticipated to be developed. Locations of inter-parcel access shall be as required by and subject to the approval of the department.
b.
Inter-parcel access easements shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county superior court and reference to deed book and copy of such recorded easement provided to the director.
c.
The inter-parcel access easement shall permit automobile access from the adjoining property to driveways and parking areas intended for customer or tenant use; but parking spaces may be restricted to use by the owner's customers and tenants only.
d.
The pavement or other surfacing of the owner's driveways and parking areas shall be extended to the point of access on the property line.
(3)
Vehicular access to lots. Any lot required to provide minimum frontage by the zoning district in which the lot is located shall provide vehicular access directly from a public or private street along the frontage or along any other property line which abuts a street, except as provided in subsection (5) of this section.
(4)
Private streets. Private streets shall be constructed to the roadway construction standards of the city, as contained herein. The private roads shall be maintained by a mandatory homeowners association and documents of incorporation shall be submitted to the director of community development for review and approval prior to the recording of the final plat. The private streets shall be clearly designated as such on the final plat.
(5)
Vehicular access easements. Vehicular access may be provided from a public street indirectly via easement in any one or more of the following circumstances:
a.
The property is not required to provide a minimum frontage by the applicable zoning district, provided that the easement shall be in a location and the access driveway shall have a width and alignment acceptable to the fire department and the department.
b.
The property is a buildable lot of record, as defined herein, but does not meet the minimum frontage requirement of the applicable zoning district. The property must be served by an exclusive access easement which shall be limited to the provision of access to only one principal use or structure.
c.
The access easement serves a single-family residence on a lot which is otherwise a buildable lot of record, and which is sharing a common driveway with no more than two other single-family residences.
d.
The access easement was lawfully established as such under the code, ordinances, or regulations of the city prior to the adoption of these development regulations.
e.
The access easement coincides with a private roadway approved under the code, ordinances, or regulations of the city. All new private roadways must be constructed to the roadway standards of these development regulations, and their ownership and maintenance responsibility by private party(s). The access easement width shall be the same as required for right-of-way on a similarly classified public road, i.e. the easement on a local street within a residential subdivision shall be the same width as the right-of-way for a public, local residential street.
f.
The access easement serves a buildable lot of record which meets the minimum frontage requirements of the zoning ordinance, but at which point the access is not achieved.
(6)
Maximum number of lots with a single entrance. A maximum number of 200 residential dwelling units may be allowed to be constructed with only one street outlet to an existing public street. If a second access to an existing public road is not available or, in the opinion of the public works director, could induce non-residential traffic through the development, a single entrance may be allowed if designed with a traffic signal and/or sufficient right-of-way and improvements to provide a protected left-turn lane, subject to the approval of the department of public works. Where more than 200 residential dwelling units are provided and a second access is not required by the director of public works the fire marshal shall review the site to determine if a private access meeting the requirements of a fire apparatus road may be required.
(7)
Gated access. Gated access to projects must be developed in accordance with the following minimum requirements:
a.
Gates shall not be located within the public right-of-way and must be set back a minimum distance of 20 feet from the right-of-way. As defined for this section the location of the right-of-way shall be the location of the existing right-of-way or dedicated right-of-way whichever is greater. Additional set back may be required to provide for adequate stacking distance, turnaround and emergency vehicle access as required by the city.
b.
Minimum gate width must equal the required road width plus the width of any utility easements present. Where gates are provided with a center support post a minimum clear width of 20 feet shall be provided on either side unless otherwise approved by the fire marshal.
c.
Gate width and placement must be reviewed by, and are subject to approval by the fire marshal's office and the department of public works.
d.
Arrangements for access through the gate for emergency service vehicles must be reviewed by, and are subject to approval by the fire marshal's office. Emergency service vehicles include, but are not limited to, fire suppression equipment, medical emergency vehicles, and law enforcement vehicles. Necessary arrangements may include Knox-fire boxes for keyed/keyless entry, keypad code entry, occupant telephone authorized entry, and/or automatic gate opening upon power disconnect.
e.
Arrangements for access through the gate for non-emergency service vehicles must be reviewed by, and are subject to approval by, the department of public works. Non-emergency public service vehicles include, but are not limited to, mail delivery, garbage pickup, public utility meter reading, and public utility maintenance and inspection vehicles. Necessary arrangements may include, but are not limited to: access easements for refuse collection vehicles and appropriate utility easements for public utility development and maintenance.
f.
Gates may not restrict access to any public right-of-way or publicly owned property within the proposed development.
g.
The city must be properly indemnified against any liability resulting from the proposed development including damage from or broken utilities, fines associated with damaged or broken utilities. This indemnification shall be evidenced by:
1.
The release and indemnity statement placed on the plat.
2.
The developer shall grant such easements to the appropriate governing authority or utility company as is necessary for public purposes regarding said community.
h.
The following standards shall be used by the city when considering any request for gated communities:
1.
The developer must demonstrate adequate provision for perpetual maintenance of the private road and any other infrastructure associated with the development, including but not limited to a note on the plat, language in the covenants, and a clause in each deed of conveyance by the developer for each lot in the subdivision acknowledging the perpetual maintenance of the private road (and other private infrastructure) by the homeowners' association.
2.
The developer must demonstrate an adequate strategy for necessary emergency access.
3.
The private road and gate must not unreasonably impede the logical future development of public roads in the vicinity of the project.
4.
The private road and gate must not unreasonably restrict public access to sites of cultural, historical, or natural significance.
5.
The private road and gate must not unreasonably restrict previously established pedestrian access.
6.
Gates may be denied based on traffic conditions, interconnectivity needs and when not in compliance with adopted guidelines.
(8)
Access improvements. When property that abuts upon an existing or proposed city street is to be developed or redeveloped and the city street will provide access to the property, access improvements to the city road (deceleration lanes, turn lanes, etc.) shall be provided by the developer as required in section 113-124.
(9)
Fire apparatus access road. A fire apparatus access road may be required to be provided for every facility, building, or portion of building hereafter constructed or moved into the city as approved by the fire marshal.
(10)
Documentation required for alternative designs. In the event that an alternative is suggested by the applicant, studies and reports conducted by professionals currently certified in the State of Georgia will be required to be submitted to and approved by the department. These studies and reports must clearly relate to the desired results and purposes expressed or implied in the applicable performance standard. Once an alternative has been approved by the department, it shall become a required standard applicable to the specific approved permit only.
(11)
Inter-parcel access to parks and trail system. Inter-parcel access through permanent easements shall be provided to connect developments to city parks when abutting the perimeter boundary of the property being developed, and to the recreational (multi-use) trail system as identified in the Johns Creek Transportation Master Plan. The developer shall be responsible for constructing the access easements (i.e. sidewalk or multi-use trail) and to record the permanent access easement pursuant to the requirements of the city. This section shall apply only to new developments processed through a land disturbance permit and/or final plat.
(Ord. No. 2009-06-18, (11.3), 6-29-2009; Ord. No. 2020-02-03 , 2-10-2020)
Sec. 113-124. - Driveways intersections and access improvements.
(1)
Angle and improvements. Driveways shall generally be at right angles and shall not be at an angle of less than 85 degrees for roadways classified as arterials or collectors and 80 degrees for all other roadway classifications unless approved by the department. This requirement may be waived by the public works director where the driveway access is to a sub-standard road (i.e. dirt or gravel) or a rural road section.
(2)
Driveway design standards.
a.
Driveways provide access to property and are a service to the traveling public. However, vehicles entering or leaving driveways may disrupt the flow of traffic on streets and cause accidents, thereby infringing on the rights of the public to travel the roadway. All driveways should be restricted to locations where movements into and out of them can occur in a safe and orderly manner.
b.
Driveways should always be designed to eliminate or minimize opposite lane encroachment while entering and exiting property.
c.
All driveways are to be designed and constructed with sidewalk/multi-use trail transitions as appropriate. Cross slope shall not exceed two percent in areas where sidewalk/multi-use trail is present or is planned to be installed according to the future sidewalk and trail network map, comprehensive plan or project approved by city council.
d.
All driveways are to be considered low volume intersections and shall comply with the minimum intersection/corner sight distance requirements of these regulations.
e.
All driveways shall slope up from the edge of road a minimum of six inches within the right-of-way to ensure that stormwater surface flow is maintained within the right-of-way. This requirement may be waived by the public works director in road sections that drain away from the gutter line, i.e. the high side of super-elevated curves.
f.
No catch basins will be allowed within access/driveway radii (turning radii).
g.
Where a driveway is constructed at a location that has or should have a ditch along the roadside for the purpose of collecting, channeling, and controlling stormwater runoff the driveway shall be constructed with a culvert designed to conduct stormwater beneath the driveway in accordance with the following:
1.
Concrete, corrugated metal pipe, or other type of culvert approved by department of public works;
2.
Sized to accommodate the 25-year storm, as a minimum, with a minimum pipe size of 18 inches. Larger storm events may need to be accommodated as specified in article XIII;
3.
Provided with flared-end sections or headwalls at the inlet and outlet; and,
4.
Of sufficient length to accommodate a minimum of two-foot shoulders on each side of the driveway with a maximum side slope of 2:1 to the bottom of the ditch line; and
5.
Installed in a ditch with a minimum two-foot wide flat bottom with sides sloped at a grade no greater than 2:1 and stabilized with acceptable vegetation.
h.
When the construction of any driveway requires the installation of a pavement overlay the overlay shall comply with subsection 113-129(3)c. of these regulations.
(3)
Residential driveway standards.
a.
Residential driveways provide a primary means of access to single-family, detached residential uses and shall conform to the following standards:
1.
Width. Minimum 14 feet, maximum 18 feet within the right-of-way.
2.
Radii or flare. Minimum five feet.
3.
The curb cut shall not encroach on the radius of the curb at a street corner.
4.
Spacing from street intersection (measured from ROW of intersecting street to nearest edge of driveway). Minimum 50 feet.
5.
No curb cut shall be less than five feet from the side property line, as measured along the right-of-way or as approved by the director.
6.
Length. A minimum of 25 feet or to the edge of the city or state right-of-way, whichever is greater, shall be paved with a treated hardened surface. Rural residential driveways may be constructed with an asphalt pavement section, if approved by the department of public works.
7.
Not more than two curb cuts shall be permitted on any one street frontage classified as a local street. When two cuts are permitted there shall be a safety zone of not less than ten feet, as measured along the curbline, between the inside edges of the driveways.
8.
Not more than one private curb cut may be located on any one street frontage for any one dwelling where the street is classified as a collector or higher order street. If a lot has access to more than one frontage, it may not have any private curb cuts on a street that is classified as a collector or higher order street. If both frontages are classified as collector or higher order streets, then the curb cut may be on the frontage with the lowest classification, or as designated by the public works department.
(4)
Nonresidential driveway standards. Nonresidential driveways (other than single-family detached uses) shall provide uninterrupted ingress/egress to and from the site and shall conform to the following standards:
a.
The minimum distance required is measured perpendicular from the street right-of-way line at the ingress/egress point to the nearest edge of any interior service drive or parking space with direct access to such. The length of the uninterrupted ingress/egress is determined by the maximum peak hour volume of the facility in which the driveway is provided and as shown in the table below. The developer shall provide this information.

  b.
Non-residential driveways shall not be designed or marked to allow more than one lane of traffic to exit onto a street simultaneously, unless such driveway is channelized in accordance with traffic engineering design principles as applicable when designing channelized street intersections.
c.
Width (measured from edge of pavement to edge of pavement):

  Notes:
(1) Where no other access is provided a minimum width of 20 feet shall be required.
(2) Additional width may be approved by the public works director based on an approved engineering design.
d.
Entrance radii shall be based on the road classification at the proposed entrance location and shall conform to the requirements set forth in subsection 113-128(4) of these regulations. Entrance radii for right-in/right-out configurations shall comply with the requirements set forth in subsection 113-124(13).
e.
Drainage. Consistent with existing drainage plan of the connecting public roadway unless other improvements are required for safety, hydrological and environmental considerations.
f.
Driveway designs other than as provided within these regulations, i.e., median divided or additional lanes, are subject to consideration of the department of public works.
(5)
Access limitations for development adjacent to thoroughfares.
a.
All access points and driveways adjacent to thoroughfares may be subject to further restriction and consideration as may be deemed necessary by the GDOT and/or the city to ensure safe, functional design and efficient operation of the thoroughfares.
b.
Access to all residential lots shall be from interior subdivision streets or roads.
c.
If the closest intersection is or is likely to be signalized, traffic movements to and from any driveway within 250 feet of an intersection with (as measured from the point of tangency) a collector or an arterial shall be limited to right turns only.
(6)
Median openings.
a.
No median opening shall be spaced at a distance less than 660 feet from any other median opening (measured from centerline to centerline) unless specifically approved by the department of public works.
b.
Other factors will also be considered, such as distance to other median openings, adjacent land use, expected traffic volumes, and the resulting volume of U-turns that are likely to occur without the median opening. Meeting the spacing criteria is not, in itself an indication that median openings will be allowed.
c.
All median openings shall include full width storage and taper length in accordance with table 11.4-6 and 11.4-7 unless otherwise acceptable to the department of public works based on a traffic study. Increased storage and transition lengths may be required to eliminate disruption of through-traffic flow. Provide a minimum 12-foot pavement width, excluding curb and gutter.
(7)
Spacing of signalized intersections. No signalized intersection shall be spaced at a distance less than 1,000 feet from any other signalized intersection (measured from centerline to centerline) unless specifically approved by the public works department.
(8)
Auxiliary lanes (turn lanes and deceleration lanes).
a.
Improvements required. When property that abuts upon an existing or proposed city road is to be developed or redeveloped and the city road will provide access to the property, access improvements to the city road (deceleration lanes, turn lanes, etc.) shall be provided by the developer at no cost to the city.
1.
When any auxiliary turn lane that extends beyond the applicant property frontage, the applicant will be responsible for acquiring the necessary rights-of-way and easements in order to accomplish the necessary frontage improvements.
2.
Existing utilities may be required to be relocated in accordance with subsection 113-141(1).
b.
Deceleration lane. A deceleration lane shall be required at each project driveway or subdivision street entrance, as applicable, that meets either the average daily traffic (ADT) or right turning volumes shown in the following table. Passing lane sections fall under the criteria for two or more lanes. The public works director may require the construction of a deceleration lane even when the conditions in table 11.4-3 are not met, if roadway or field conditions indicate that the safety of the general public would be improved.
Deceleration lanes required by this section shall meet the following requirements:
1.
Deceleration lanes shall have a pavement width of 12 feet (exclusive of curb and gutter) and shall meet the following standards for storage and taper length:

    2.
Additional right-of-way to accommodate the deceleration lane and an 11-foot shoulder shall be dedicated by the developer to the city at no cost. Associated drainage improvements as deemed necessary by the construction of the deceleration lane shall also be required.
3.
Other access improvements may be required by the department of public works in order to ensure adequate site access, pedestrian access, convenience and safety to the motoring public.
4.
The pavement specifications for deceleration lanes must comply with the GDOT standard specifications of roads and bridges, except as approved by the public works director.
c.
Medians. In the event a street has an existing or proposed median, the opening will be reviewed in accordance with subsection (6) of this section.
d.
Left turn lanes. Left turn lanes must be constructed at no cost to the city if either the ADT or left turning volumes shown in the following table are met. Passing lane sections fall under the criteria for two or more lanes. The public works director may also require the addition of a left turn lane, even when the conditions in the following table are not met, if roadway geometry or field conditions indicate that the safety of the traveling public would be improved.

  Left turn lanes required by this section shall meet the following requirements:
1.
The design of left turn lanes should consider the intended function and the characteristics of the roadway. In many cases, it is necessary to widen the existing roadway to introduce the left turn lane. Left turn lanes shall be constructed at no cost to the city.
2.
When the roadway has a median that is at least 20 feet wide, the left turn lane can be developed out of the median, avoiding the need for transitions. If a proposed driveway aligns across the main street with another driveway, and the proposed driveway must provide a left turn lane and left turn storage, then adequate storage and tapers must also be provided for the driveway across the main street.
3.
The basic design elements of left turn lanes are illustrated in the following table. This example shows symmetrical widening, which basically requires the through traffic on each side to shift by one-half of the lane width. Some circumstances may dictate that all widening be achieved on one side, which requires a full lane shift for through traffic on the side where the additional width is developed.

  4.
The required length of full-width storage is based on the peak hour traffic volumes. This should be determined in the traffic study. The amount of storage is dependent on the type of traffic control in effect. For signalized intersections, the storage should be sufficient to accommodate the 95th percentile peak hour queue. At yield-controlled intersections, the storage is based on the number of vehicles as designated in table 11.4-7.

  e.
Relocation of utilities. The developer shall be responsible for the relocation of public or private utilities and drainage structures as may be occasioned by the required project access improvements.
(9)
Left turning control radii. The path of the inside wheels during left turns is important for the design of median openings and intersections with dual left turn lanes. The following radii shall be used for the design of entrance improvements.

Corner sight distance. All driveways shall provide adequate corner sight distance in accordance with the standards established for an intersection as set forth in subsection 113-128(6).
(11)
Separation and spacing. All driveways except those serving residential units on individual lots shall be recommended to meet the following criteria:
a.
Spacing requirements, associated with the construction of new driveways, are provided in the following table 11.4-9. Driveways should be separated from any other facility, which accesses a city roadway, whether it is another driveway or a public street. Minimum spacing requirements also apply to driveways on the opposite side of undivided roadways.

  Notes: (1) Requirements for the length of right and left turn lanes, as shown in table 11.4-4 and table 11.4-6, may increase the minimum allowable spacing shown in table 11.4-9.
b.
Spacing of one-way driveways. Figure 11.4-4 shows a typical layout of one-way driveways. The spacing criteria presented in table 11.4-9 does not apply to the distance between the two, one-way driveways (driveway pair). A driveway pair must be separated from another driveway pair by the distance as shown in table 11.4-9. A driveway pair must also be separated from an adjacent two-way driveway in accordance with the spacing criteria in table 11.4-9.
Figure 11.4-4: Spacing Criteria for One-Way Driveways
c.
Placement of driveways. Not only must driveways be spaced from other driveways as provided above, they must also be located a minimum distance from the property line. The radius return must be a minimum of five feet from the property line. Single-family detached residential driveways shall be located as provided in subsection (3) of this section.
When driveways are to be jointly used by two or more property owners, the property line separation requirements given in the above paragraph can be waived. However, a joint use agreement signed by the affected property owners must be provided to the public works department. Either property owner may apply for the driveway permit.
d.
Driveway spacing. Driveways should align with other driveways located on the opposite side of the roadway. If offset driveways cannot be avoided, the same driveway spacing criteria as given in table 11.4-9 should be provided, to provide space for left turns. Figure 11.4-5 shows how the spacing is measured for locating offset driveways on undivided roadways. Spacing is from center to center.
Figure 11.4-5: Spacing of Offset Driveways
If the city roadway involved is a divided facility and the driveways do not align with a median crossover, the driveway spacing would only apply to the adjacent driveway located on the same side of the roadway as shown above in figure 11.4-5.
Meeting the spacing criteria is not, in itself an indication that driveways will be allowed.
e.
Maximum number of driveways serving a single project: one for each full 200 feet of property frontage This is not meant to be a spacing standard but only an expression of the maximum number of driveways that are permitted serving a single project.
(12)
Raised islands. Raised islands associated with entrance improvements shall be designed in accordance with the standards provided in subsection 113-128(5).
(13)
Right-in, right-out driveways.
a.
Raised islands are also typically used to channelize the movements at a driveway where only right turns are allowed. The raised island is an effective means of preventing left turns. All right-in, right-out islands must have a radius that is 70 feet, or a compound curve that approximates 70 feet.
b.
Right-in, right-out driveways are not intended for truck traffic, so the exit and entrance lanes must be 12 feet in width as measured from face of curb to face of curb. The island must be constructed from mountable curb (three inches vertical, 45 degree face, three inches flat) to accommodate emergency vehicles. The edge of the island should be offset 18 inches to 24 inches from the edge of the travel lane.
(14)
Pavement design.
a.
All construction, within the right of way, of surfaces intended for travel by motorized vehicles shall be paved. The pavement specification of auxiliary lanes on city roadways shall be the GDOT Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges, or as designated in city standards, whichever is more restrictive.
b.
New developments are required to widen the road along their frontage to a uniform lane width of 12 feet. If the widened area is two feet or less in width, a concrete sub-base should be provided per the current standards. The developer must then either pave the entire width of the road, or mill to the centerline and pave to match the existing road. Transitions shall be milled a minimum of 25 feet. Any deviation from this standard requires a waiver from the public works director.
c.
When pavement construction requires the installation of an overlay, the overlay shall comply with subsection 113-129(3) of these regulations.
(15)
Pedestrian considerations. When driveways are constructed in areas where pedestrian activity is not prohibited, the design should adequately provide for pedestrian movement and interaction with vehicular traffic. Pedestrian features that should be considered include sidewalks, multi-use trails, crosswalks, traffic control features, curb ramps and detectable warning strips where required. The Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines must be utilized where pedestrian traffic is expected.

Traffic impact studies. Any proposed site plan or subdivision plan which would be expected to generate over 100 total trips during the peak hour of the traffic generator or the peak hour on the adjacent streets, or over 750 trips in an average day shall submit a traffic impact study in accordance with the city standards. In addition, the city may find that proposed or existing site conditions may warrant the submission of a traffic impact study even when the above thresholds are not exceeded. Those conditions may include, but not be limited to the following:
a.
High traffic volumes on surrounding roads that my affect movement to and from the proposed development.
b.
Lack of existing left turn lanes on the adjacent roadway at the proposed access drive.
c.
Inadequate sight distance at access points.
d.
The proximity of the proposed access points to other existing drives or intersections.
e.
A development that includes a drive-through operation
(Ord. No. 2009-06-18, (11.4), 6-29-2009)
Sec. 113-125. - General layout requirements.
(1)
Conformance. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform at a minimum to the comprehensive plan and these regulations.
(2)
Local streets and collectors. Local streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Collectors shall be provided to channel through traffic movements within a development, where appropriate to the design and a major thoroughfare is not proposed by the comprehensive plan. Collectors also may be provided as central routes within large residential subdivisions, where appropriate to the design, based on project traffic demands exceeding 4,000 trips per day (ADT). However, this is not intended to eliminate interparcel access or desirable connectivity as required in section 113-123(2).
(3)
Cul-de-sac and dead end streets or alleys.
a.
Maximum length without an approved turnaround. Dead end streets or alleys more than 150 feet in length, as measured from the centerline of the intersecting street to the end of the improved access road, shall provide a cul-de-sac turnaround. Alternative turnarounds may be provided as approved by the fire marshal and the public works director.
b.
Minimum street length. The minimum street length for a cul-de-sac street shall be 50 feet.
c.
Maximum design length. Cul-de-sac or dead end streets may be no more than 600 feet in length as measured from the nearest intersection. Additional length necessitated by topography or property configuration may be approved by the public works director.
d.
Measurement of cul-de-sac length. The length of a cul-de-sac street shall be measured along the centerline from the point of tangency of the entrance radius to the point of curvature for the cul-de-sac radius return.
e.
Eyebrow cul-de-sacs. Eyebrow cul-de-sac (half cul-de-sacs) will not be permitted at "right-angled" intersections. Eyebrow cul-de-sacs shall only be allowed on a tangent or straight road section or on curves meeting the minimum standards of subsection 113-127(3).
f.
Conformance to standard drawings. Cul-de-sacs shall conform to the layout and dimensional requirements as shown in the standard drawings.
g.
Cul-de-sacs with landscape islands. Non-standard cul-de-sacs will be evaluated individually and may be constructed with a landscaped island (subject to approval by the fire marshal and the public works director) to be maintained by the home-owners association in perpetuity.
h.
Minimum cul-de-sac radius. Minimum cul-de-sac radii shall be 50 feet.
(4)
Other dead end streets.
a.
A dead end street shall be provided to the boundary of a subdivision where necessary to provide access to a land-locked abutting property, for planned continuity of future circulation, for improved access for public safety vehicles, or for the extension of public water or other utilities to neighboring lands. Such dead end streets shall be designed so as to allow their reasonable extension, and shall be located so as to be reasonably incorporated into a street design for the neighboring property. The stub street requirement may be waived by the public works director, provided the fire marshal concurs.
b.
Dead end streets on abutting property shall be extended into a proposed subdivision and incorporated into the street design of the development. This requirement may be modified by the director in cases of serious topographical hardship or dissimilar zoning which would create unacceptable land use conflicts between the two developments. This modification may be conditioned on the provision of easements necessary for the extension of public utilities, the provision of cul-de-sac or other permanent turnaround on the dead end street, or the removal of the dead end street back to its nearest intersection.
c.
Where a dead end street (other than a cul-de-sac) serves more than three lots, the developer shall be required to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround within the right-of-way. This requirement may be waived if extension of the dead end street is approved and under construction prior to its inclusion in a final plat.
d.
Where a street dead ends at the property boundary and the street exceeds the maximum cul-de-sac length a permanent cul-de-sac shall be required. In this situation, right-of-way to the property boundary shall be required, but the pavement shall not be extended to the property boundary beyond the edge of the paved cul-de-sac turnaround.
(5)
Service roads.
a.
Where a development borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or limited access highway right-of-way or major thoroughfare, a public street may be required to be constructed and dedicated within the development approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way.
b.
All driveways along designated thoroughfares with existing or planned service roads shall provide access to such service roads. To gain temporary direct access to the thoroughfare, the developer shall construct the section of the service road adjacent to the development. The service road section shall be located where planned. Any right-of-way not previously dedicated shall be dedicated prior to consideration of a temporary driveway approval providing direct access to the thoroughfare.
(6)
Half-streets. Half-streets (new boundary streets having one-half of the minimum required right-of-way or pavement width) shall not be allowed nor access to same be permitted should it exist.
(7)
Reserve strips. Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way which could control or are intended to control access to streets, alleys, or public lands shall not be permitted unless their control is given to the city under ownership, dedication, or easement conditions approved by the city attorney or acceptable to the public works director. No development shall be designed so as to deny access to abutting properties.
(8)
Alleys. Alleys shall not be provided except where the developer produces evidence satisfactory to the public works director of the need for same. In the event the public works director approves a design which proposes alleys, the alley shall be constructed as though it were a local street (except where a specific standard for alley exists) pursuant to the standards contained in these regulations, including fire apparatus turn around as required in subsection (3) of this section.
Refer to subsection 113-126(1) for additional information on required pavement widths for alleys.
(9)
Street jogs. Streets shall be aligned as per driveways as shown on table 11.4-9.
(10)
Traffic calming. Where residential streets are longer than 600 feet, traffic calming devices may be incorporated as required by the public works director. The design of all measures shall comply with the applicable standards for the construction of such measures.
(11)
Bike lanes. When required, the developer shall dedicate sufficient right-of-way to the city, or applicable entity, and install the necessary pavement and other improvements for the construction of bicycle lanes in locations as may be required by the director. Bicycle lanes shall be a minimum of four feet in width as measured from the edge of pavement, not including curb and gutter, and constructed in accordance with the AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities, latest edition, and the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, latest edition.
(12)
Bus shelters. When required, the developer shall provide bus shelters within or adjacent to the right-of-way which are in compliance with the design standards of the local transit authority and as approved by the city. The public works director may require the construction of turnout areas, widened shoulders or other facilities necessary to accommodate the loading and unloading of passengers.

Street rights-of-way.
a.
Dedication of street right-of-way. Right-of-way for all public streets, existing and proposed shall be dedicated in accordance with the street classifications as shown on the functional classification map of the comprehensive plan and in accordance with these regulations. Right-of-way dedications shall be made prior to the approval of a final plat or, where a final plat is not involved, prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit, unless otherwise approved by the public works director.
b.
Right-of-way for projects adjacent to comprehensive plan projects. If a new street or thoroughfare is proposed by the comprehensive plan or the State of Georgia to adjoin or traverse the property, permits shall not be issued until the department has submitted the project to the mayor and city council for review in order to seek a determination if the city should acquire the right-of-way or if a study of alternate routes should be undertaken. The review period by the city shall not exceed 90 days from the date of permit application. If, after the 90-day review, the mayor and city council is unable to reach a decision, there shall not be any further delay of a requested permit for this situation.
c.
Right-of-way for projects adjacent to funded roadway projects. If a new street or thoroughfare is funded by the city or the State of Georgia to adjoin or traverse the property, the proposed road right-of-way shall be incorporated into the development plans of the property in accordance with these regulations. The right-of-way requirements contained in these regulations shall govern except where there exists clearly defined plans of GDOT or the city, which require additional right-of-way. In that case, the greater right-of-way requirements shall govern.
d.
Right-of-way for projects adjacent to designed roadway projects. Any development with property fronting on an existing city road for which there exists clearly defined plans by the GDOT or the city, may be required to provide road improvements associated with the defined plans or, in lieu of the design and construction, at the discretion of the director, the developer may be required escrow the dollar equivalency of required improvements (including curbing, utility relocation, and drainage structures, etc., as estimated by the developer and verified by the public works department. These funds shall be deposited in the appropriate road construction account prior to the approval of development improvements or within 30 days of city award of a construction contract, whichever occurs first.
e.
Dedication of minimum required right-of-way for abutting streets. On any existing street that abuts a property and does not meet the minimum right-of-way requirements as established in these regulations, one-half of the required width of right-of-way shall be dedicated at no cost to the city as measured from the centerline of the roadway prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit for that property.
f.
Location of the right-of-way. Except where it can be shown to be in the best interest of the safety, health and welfare of the general public or specifically approved by the public works department the location of the right-of-way shall be located as follows:
1.
The right-of-way shall be parallel to the back of curb and be mitered at intersections to provide adequate area for utilities, sidewalk, multi-use trails, sight distance and maintenance of the right-of-way.
2.
Right-of-way shall be located a minimum of 11 feet from the back-of-curb or one-foot from the back of sidewalk/multi-use trail, whichever is greater, to prevent interference or encroachment by fencing, walls, hedges and other planting or structures that may be placed on the adjacent property line at a later date.
[g.]
Right-of-way setback adjacent to residentially zoned property. The right-of-way for new public streets or the easement/common area for new private streets must be located a minimum of 50 feet from any peripheral property line adjoining residentially zoned property unless inter-parcel access is required. This setback shall comply with the provisions of subsection 113-125(7) for reserve strips.
[h.]
Minimum right-of-way miters. Miters shall comply with the following minimum standards, the miter distances shall be measured along the right-of-way from the point of intersection of the two rights-of-way if they were extended:
1.
Twenty-foot miters (minimum) shall be provided at the right-of-way intersection of any major thoroughfare.
2.
Ten-foot miters (minimum) shall be provided at the right-of-way intersection of any local roads.

Street grades and design speeds.
a.
Minimum grade. Minimum grade for all local streets shall be 1.5 percent. Minimum grades for all collector and arterial streets shall conform to GDOT practice.
Minimum grades of less than 1.5 percent on a local street may be approved by the department, based on adequate engineering designs, where at least 1.5 percent cannot reasonably be achieved due to topographical limitations imposed by the land. In such cases, a record drawing and such computations as necessary shall be provided after construction to establish that the street will drain in accordance with these regulations. Street sections where unacceptable pooling, excessive spread at catch basins, or other hazardous conditions occur shall be reconstructed or otherwise improved to eliminate such conditions.

  Notes:
* Clear zones may be limited to 30 feet
** Fixed objects should not be present in the vicinity of the toe of these slopes. The width of the recovery zones should consider a number of factors including right of way availability, economic factors, safety needs, and accident history.
All areas located within the clear zones should remain clear of obstructions such as bridge abutments, poles, trees, etc. If obstructions are unavoidable, the design should include appropriate protection such as break-away design, guardrail installation, safety end treatments on culverts, etc. The roadway design guide includes a table for horizontal curve adjustments, where the clear zone correction factor is applied to the outside of curves only. Curves flatter than a 2,860 foot radius do not require an adjusted clear zone.
3.
Increased clear zone in certain locations. At selected locations, such as the outside of a sharp curve, a wider clear zone with greater horizontal clearances to any roadside obstruction may be required.
4.
Removal of obstructions. The department of public works, in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 32-6-51 and these development regulations, is authorized to remove or direct the removal of any sign, signal, device, vegetation, or other structure erected, placed, or maintained on the right-of-way of a public road which because of its nature, construction, or operation, constitutes a danger to, or interferes with the vision of, drivers of motor vehicles.
b.
Vertical clearances. Vertical clearance for all overhead obstructions shall be at least 16 feet over the entire roadway width.
Additional clearance may be required for obstructions over railroads, state or federal roadways or other transportation routes.

Sec. 113-128. - Street intersections.
(1)
General requirements. Street intersections shall be consistent with the applicable requirements for driveways as determined by the public works director and as set forth in section 113-124.
(2)
Intersection approaches; horizontal alignment.
a.
New local streets which approach an intersection with a street in a category higher than itself on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius less than 240 feet shall provide a tangent section of roadway at least 30 feet long. Collectors approaching an intersection with a major thoroughfare on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius of less than 550 feet shall also provide the 30-foot tangent section. The tangent length shall be measured along the centerline of the street, from the right-of-way line of the intersecting street, extended, to the point of tangency with the centerline of the curve section.
b.
New major thoroughfares shall provide tangent sections at intersections with streets in equal or higher categories as needed to provide adequate stopping distances at their design speeds.
(3)
Intersection approaches; Vertical alignment.
a.
Approach landings at local streets. For new street intersections with local streets, a leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding three percent shall be provided for a distance of not less than 50 feet as measured from the back of curb of the intersecting street.
b.
Approach landings at collectors or arterials. As a street approaches an intersection with a collector or arterial, there shall be a suitable leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding two percent and for a distance not less than the following minimums:

Distance of the approach is measured from edge of pavement of the intersecting street to the point of curvature in the approaching street.
(4)
Intersection radii.
a.
Intersection radii for roadways as measured at back of curb and for the right-of-way lines shall be as follows. The minimum roadway radii for the intersection of local and non-residential local streets is 25 feet. For all other roadway classifications the minimum roadway radii is 50 feet. When a local or residential collector intersects a higher classification of roadway, the radii shall be a minimum of 50 feet. Larger radii may be required for streets intersecting at an angle of less than 90° or when vehicle and operating circumstances dictate. As approved by the public works director, the radii can be reduced a maximum of five feet for the following reasons:
1.
Separation from street; or
2.
Removal of obstruction.
b.
Intersecting right-of-way lines shall be joined by a miter which cuts across the right-of-way lines connecting the points where the required radius would have otherwise been tangent. Miters shall be measured as provided in subsection 113-126(2)h.
(5)
Islands.
a.
Islands in street intersections shall conform to the design requirements of the standard drawings. In no case shall anything in an island in the right-of-way extend more than three feet above the street grade within the right-of-way, except traffic regulatory devices and other infrastructure erected or approved by the city. No island shall be approved which contains less than 100 square feet for median islands or 50 square feet for corner islands.
b.
Islands within the right-of-way or access easements shall be constructed with mountable curb sections per GDOT specifications, unless otherwise approved by the public works director.
c.
Islands are an important form of intersection channelization that is often needed to prohibit undesirable movements, define the paths of allowed movements, and provide a refuge area for pedestrians. Any location where two outbound lanes are proposed for a driveway at an un-signalized location, the right line must be for right-out only movement, and separated from the other lane by a raised island.
d.
Painted lines are an effective means to direct the paths of vehicular movement. However, raised islands are more effective during times when visibility is reduced. When islands are to serve as pedestrian refuge areas, they should be constructed as raised islands. All sign posts to be placed within concrete area must have hole through pavement structure. The hole may be either formed, drilled or sawed.
e.
When multiple crosswalks are required to pass through islands, the required size may exceed the 100 square feet mentioned above. The additional area may be required to install wheelchair ramps. As an alternate to ramps, the pedestrian travel way can be "slotted" through the island, remaining on the grade of the roadway.
f.
Raised islands should be offset from the edge of the adjacent travel lane on all sides. The amount of offset shall be a minimum of 18 inches as measured from the edge of the travel lane to the face of the curb. When raised islands are adjacent to roadways with posted speed limits of 50 m.p.h. or greater, the island shall be offset from the edge of the roadway by a minimum distance of ten feet.
(6)
Intersection sight distance.
a.
Intersections shall be designed with adequate corner sight distance. Where necessary, back slopes shall be flattened and horizontal or vertical curves lengthened to provide the minimum required sight distance.
b.
The minimum intersection sight distance requirement may be calculated using AASHTO "Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets," chapter 9 (Intersections), latest edition. Intersection sight distance is determined with an assumed height of driver's eye of 3.5 feet and an assumed height of object of 3.5 feet when measuring in the vertical plane. When measuring in the horizontal plane, the intersection sight distance is determined with an assumed driver's eye location from a point four feet offset from the centerline and 15 feet from the edge of closest travel lane to a point along the centerline of the closest oncoming travel lane. When measuring in either plane, the line of sight must remain within the proposed standard dedicated right-of-way:

Preparation. Sub-grade preparation shall be in accordance with GDOT specifications and these regulations.
b.
Unsuitable material. If any sections of the sub-grade are composed of topsoil, organic, or other unsuitable or unstable material, such material shall be removed and replaced with suitable material and then thoroughly compacted as specified for fill or stabilized with stone or a geo-textile or geo-grid as approved by the director.
c.
Compaction. Fill shall be placed in uniform, horizontal layers not more than eight inches thick (loose measurement). Moisture content shall be adjusted as necessary to compact material to 95 percent maximum laboratory dry density and the top 12 inches to 100 percent maximum laboratory dry density as determined by AASHTO method T-99.
d.
Utility installation. After the earthwork has been completed, all storm drainage, water, and sanitary sewer utilities have been installed within the right-of-way as appropriate, and the backfill in all such ditches thoroughly compacted, the sub-grade shall be brought to the lines, grades, and typical roadway section shown on the plans.
e.
Compaction testing. Utility trenches cut in the sub-grade shall be backfilled as specified herein. Compaction tests at the rate of one per 150 feet of trench may be required to verify compaction.
f.
Proof-roll. The sub-grade must pass roll testing with a fully loaded dump truck prior to placement of the base material. With the approval of the department, a geo-textile or grid may be used to stabilize a sub-grade that does not pass proof rolling.
g.
Use of roads as construction roads. When the street is to be used for construction traffic before the paving work is completed, a layer of stone (except crusher run) shall be laid as a traffic surface. This material shall not be used as a part of the base material. It may be worked into the sub-grade, or it shall be removed before the base course is set up for paving.
h.
Temporary drainage. Provisions shall be made to drain low points in the road construction when the final paving is delayed. A break in the berm section is required when the curbing has not been constructed. After installation, drainage under the curb to side slopes is required, using minimum four inch diameter pipe sections.

b.
Prime coat.
1.
If a delay in paving is reasonably expected by the developer or the city, the base shall be primed with 0.25 gallon of R.C. 70 per square yard the same day it is compacted, and cured for seven days prior to paving.
2.
Prime coats may also be required for cement or lime stabilized bases or sub-bases, regardless of pavement thickness.
3.
Prime coats shall not be applied to a wet surface, in air temperatures less than 40 degrees F in the shade or if rain is imminent.
c.
Soil cement subgrade.
1.
If the subgrade material (resident soil) is unsatisfactory to the city then a soil cement mix design with engineer test results acceptable to the city may be used. The design must come from a geo-technical firm with the results certified by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia. The tests required for the design are ASTM D558 or AASHTO T134 or ASTM D559 and/or 560 or ASHTO T135 and 136.
2.
The minimum base course shall consist of at least six inches of suitable soil (high mica content not suitable) stabilized with ten percent of Portland cement by volume (approximately 42.3 pounds per sq. yd.). Where the grade of the street is five percent or greater, a single surface treatment course must be applied before the binder.
(3)
Paving standards for all streets.
a.

Residential subdivision projects. Sidewalks/multi-use trails shall be installed on both sides of new internal public or private streets (including "eyebrow" turnarounds) and along the entire frontage of all abutting external streets (abutting side). Sidewalks are required on only one side of internal public or private streets in projects developed at densities of 1.5 units per acre or less or where it is determined by the director of public works that a sidewalk on one side of the street meets the intent of these requirements, i.e. a cul-de-sac street serving less than ten lots. Sidewalks/multi-use trails are required adjacent to cul-de-sac turnarounds in accordance with the standard drawings.
1.
Residential subdivision developer responsibility. Developers shall install sidewalks/multi-use trails on abutting external streets as shown on the future sidewalk and trail network map, "passive" recreation area lots, and open space lots, and shall install intersection radius curb ramps at new street intersections, and L-shaped mid-block ramps at cul-de-sac turnarounds, prior to approval of the final plat. Sidewalks/multi-use trails on "active" recreation area lots shall be installed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or shall be installed by the developer prior to release of the subdivision maintenance surety agreement, whichever is earlier. Developers shall also install sidewalks/multi-use trails on any vacant lots remaining between developed lots (i.e. dwellings under construction or completed) prior to release of the subdivision maintenance surety agreement.
2.
Homebuilder responsibility. Homebuilders shall install sidewalks/multi-use trails, and curb ramps not required to be installed by developers, on building lots prior to release of the certificate of occupancy for a home.
b.
Nonresidential subdivision projects. Sidewalks/multi-use trails shall be installed on both sides of new internal streets (including cul-de-sac and "eyebrow" turnarounds) and along the entire frontage of all abutting external streets (abutting side) prior to approval of the final plat.

d.
Drainage. Where sidewalk/multi-use is required and no curb and gutter exists the developer shall install all necessary drainage facilities, i.e. curb and gutter or swales. The facilities shall be constructed at the developers' expense to minimize the flow of water on or over the sidewalk/multi-use trail section and to comply with allowable gutter spread requirements. Where drainage swales are used the swale shall be located between the roadway and sidewalk section.
e.
Maintenance surety agreement. Maintenance surety agreement provided to the city shall include the cost of sidewalk/multi-use trail construction in an amount acceptable to the city.
f.
Escrow alternative.
1.
The cost of sidewalk/multi-use trail installation may be set aside in escrow with the department of public works if proposed road improvements by the city or the Georgia Department of Transportation may impact the location of a sidewalk/multi-use trail.
2.
Where the director of public works determines the topography of the road frontage is such that a special hardship exists on the property, he may authorize a payment to the city in lieu of the required installation of the sidewalk. Criteria shall be established for all such approved hardships by the director of public works to determine how the amount of payment will be calculated. Such criteria to determine the method of calculating such payment shall be approved by the city council and may be amended by the council thereafter upon recommendation of the director of public works or the city manager.
(3)
Sidewalk/multi-use trail design and construction standards. Sidewalks/multi-use trails shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of this section.

Speed limit sign (R2-1). Speed limit signs shall indicate a 25 mph speed limit for streets internal to residential subdivisions, unless it is a non-residential local or collector road for the development, and then it should be no higher than 35 mph. For neighborhood settings, only one speed limit sign shall be installed at each project entrance or at the points of change from one speed limit to another. This sign should be installed no less than 100 feet from the entrance of the subdivision, but no greater than 500 feet from the entrance.
4.
Street name sign (D3-1). Ground-mounted street name signs shall be installed at every intersection and shall conform to MUTCD, latest edition. Instead of ground mounted signs, however, overhead street name signs shall be installed where a subdivision street intersects at any traffic signal. Street name signs for public roads shall be green with a one-quarter-inch white border and street name signs for private roads shall be blue with a one-quarter-inch white border. The letter height must be six inches. The letters should be in FHWA series "D" font or lower or as approved by the department of public works. The street name sign shall be a combination of lower-case letters with initial uppercase letters. If the street has no outlet or is a dead end, an auxiliary "No Outlet" or "Dead End" sign shall be installed at the top of the sign post oriented to the proper street.
The street name sign should be constructed on nine inch flat blades and not extruded blades. they will be mounted "flag style" using Tapco Jumbo brackets or equivalent. The street name sign shall be posted on the same post as the stop sign.
