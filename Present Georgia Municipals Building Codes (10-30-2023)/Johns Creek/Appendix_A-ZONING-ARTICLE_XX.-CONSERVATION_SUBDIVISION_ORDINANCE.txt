ARTICLE XX. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE

Sec. 20.1. - Purpose and Intent.
It is the purpose and intent of this ordinance to encourage preservation of open space within residential developments; provide flexibility to allow for creativity in developments; minimize the environmental and visual impacts of new development on critical natural resources and historically and culturally significant sites and structures; provide an interconnected network of permanent open space; encourage a more efficient form of development that consumes less open land and conforms to existing topography and natural features; reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation; enhance the community character; permit clustering of houses and structures which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility lines; encourage street design that controls traffic speeds and creates street inter-connectivity; and promote construction of convenient and accessible walking trails and bike paths both within a subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles.
Sec. 20.2. - Applicability of Regulations.
The Conservation Subdivision option shall require a Use Permit and is available for single-family detached residential developments in the following districts: AG-1, R-1, R-2, R-2A, R-3, R-3A, R-4, R-4A, and R-5. Compliance with all applicable ordinances, regulations, or resolutions is required; however, when in conflict, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
Sec. 20.3. - Conservation Subdivision Density.
Housing Density Determination: The maximum number of lots in the Conservation Subdivision is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel:
a.
50% of the Primary Conservation Areas.
b.
Anticipated right-of-way for roads and utilities (minimum of 18% of gross tract area).
Sec. 20.4. - Lot Requirements and Tract Size.
The minimum lot size in any project shall be 4,000 square feet. The total number of lots may not exceed the number of lots that could otherwise be developed under the existing zoning.
The minimum tract size for the overall development shall be 10 acres. The land shall not have been used for timber harvesting within the previous 24 months.
Sec. 20.5. - Minimum Lot Frontage.
The minimum lot frontage on a right-of-way or private street shall be 20 feet.
Sec. 20.6. - Setbacks, Building Separation, and Architectural Standards Requirements.
Setbacks, building separations, and architectural standards shall be established by the Use Permit and are subject to the provisions of the Building Code.
Sec. 20.7. - Exterior Buffer Requirements.
A minimum 50-foot wide natural buffer, undisturbed except for approved access and utility crossings and replantings where sparsely vegetated, plus a 10-foot improvement setback, shall be provided along all property lines adjacent to AG-1 zoned properties, residentially zoned properties, and existing roads, or as may be approved by the Director. The 50-foot wide buffer along the property frontage may include a 20-foot landscape strip and other entrance features.
Sec. 20.8. - Application Requirements.

Other Requirements: The Applicant shall adhere to all other applicable requirements of the underlying zoning, Development regulations, and other applicable ordinances.
Sec. 20.9. - Definition of Open Space.
Open Space is the portion of the conservation subdivision that has been set aside for permanent protection. Activities within the open space are restricted in perpetuity through the use of an approved legal instrument.
Sec. 20.10. - Open Space Requirement.
Each conservation subdivision shall provide a minimum of 40% of its total gross acreage as open space as defined by this ordinance. The open space shall be designated on the site analysis map, development plan and subsequently recorded on the final plat.
Sec. 20.11. - Open Space Configuration.
The minimum standards for open space are as follows:
a.
The minimum width of any open space area is 25 feet.
b.
All paths shall be a minimum of 20 feet from any overall project exterior property line except where interparcel access may be required.
c.
All open space shall provide connectivity to any common areas within the development and to any adjacent public places/rights-of-way or as approved by the Director.

g.
Above-ground utility rights-of-way and small areas of impervious surface (i.e.: picnic table and benches) may be included within the protected Open Space but cannot be counted towards the 40 percent minimum area requirement (exception: historic structures and existing trails may be counted). Impervious areas greater than 50 square feet shall be excluded from the Open Space.
h.
At least 75 percent of the Open Space shall be in a contiguous tract. The Open Space shall adjoin any neighboring areas of Open Space, other protected areas, and non-protected natural areas that would be candidates for inclusion as part of a future area of protected Open Space.
Sec. 20.12. - Open Space and Conservation Areas.
Open space shall be designated as either primary conservation areas or secondary conservation areas and shall remain natural and undisturbed except for permitted activities.
Sec. 20.13. - Primary Conservation Areas.
Primary conservation areas form the core of the open space and are required to be included within the open space. Active recreation areas are prohibited in primary conservation areas unless approved by the Director. Primary conservation areas, as defined by this ordinance, include the following:
a.
Cemeteries;
b.
Habitats for endangered or threatened species as defined by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources;
c.
Wetlands identified by the National Wetlands Inventory maps prepared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the County Soil Survey prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service, or a certified wetlands delineation using data from the U.

Sec. 20.14. - Value of Primary Conservation Areas.
Because primary conservation areas are either protected or sensitive environmental areas, 100% of the acreage of a primary conservation area may be counted as open space.
Sec. 20.15. - Secondary Conservation Areas.
Secondary conservation areas consist of undeveloped (unconstrained) but buildable land and protected (constrained) lands and may be included within the open space to the maximum extent feasible. Secondary conservation areas, as defined by this ordinance, include the following:

Sec. 20.16. - Value of Secondary Conservation Areas.
With the exception of active recreation areas and facilities, 100% of secondary conservation areas may be counted as open space. Because active recreation areas are cleared and graded and therefore reduce natural resources and wildlife habitats, only 50% of active recreation , excluding impervious surfaces, may be counted as open space.
Sec. 20.17. - Open Space Protection.
The required open space areas shall be protected in perpetuity from further development or unauthorized use by a conservation easement or permanent restrictive covenant (per O.C.G.A.
