Sec. 4.4. - Large-Scale Retail/Service Commercial Developments.
4.4.1.
Purpose and Intent. "Large-scale retail/service commercial" refers to any retail and/or service commercial development with gross floor area of 75,000 square feet or greater in C-1 and C-2 Zoning Districts.
The purpose of establishing requirements is to apply design standards and additional conditions to large developments proposed in the City of Johns Creek and to ensure such development is appropriate, well-planned, aesthetically pleasing, stimulate economic and social growth, and integrate well with surrounding areas.
As such, these regulations intend to promote high quality materials and design, promote pedestrian-friendly environments, encourage infrastructure concurrency, encourage responsible storm-water management practices, and promote environmental planning policies.
The regulations are to be used in conjunction with the development criteria of the City of Johns Creek Zoning Ordinance and all other adopted development standards and criteria. If any provision of this article is in conflict with any other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, the Development Regulations, or the Tree Ordinance, the provision of this article shall control.

They are solely permitted on sites with at least one frontage on an arterial road.
Developments are encouraged to create a cluster effect in order to achieve a village and/or town center effect with the inclusion of plazas, village greens or other common open space for gathering and events. The ordinance promotes an appropriate mix of large and small scale retail/service commercial with smaller retail buildings located closer to streets in order to reduce the visual scale of the development, encourage pedestrian traffic, and promote the use of architectural details.
The ordinance also recognizes the varied types of developments in the City of Johns Creek and promotes the use of screening and buffers.

For purposes of this Section, Inclusionary Housing Development means a development containing a building with more than eight (8) units for multi-family or for all residential developments of 20 units or more, in which 10 percent of the total units must be inclusionary units restricted for occupancy by very low, low, or moderate income households except as otherwise provided for herein. The Director of Community Development may allow for variation from these principles, but only the extent necessary, if he or she determines that an alternative configuration of Inclusionary Units is required by funding or financing considerations associated with the development of the Inclusionary Units or by the applicable residential land use designations within and adjacent to the Residential Project.
C.
Proposed Inclusionary Single-family Housing Developments that are located within a census track(s) in which 95% of the existing units are below 80% AMI, must submit a Housing Development Plan that includes the following mixed housing price points for sale:

4.26.6.
Alternatives to the Standard Inclusionary Housing Component. Subject to the approval of the Mayor and City Councilin lieu of constructing affordable housing units on site, a developer may dedicate land or pay in-lieu housing fees. At the time of concept plan review, the developer shall be required to provide a report to the Community Development Director identifying the reasons the construction of the required number of affordable housing units within the development is not feasible. The report shall include sufficient independent data, including appropriate financial information, which supports the developer's claim that it is not feasible to construct the required affordable units and a detailed analysis of why the density bonus cannot mitigate the conditions that prevent the developer from constructing the affordable units. The Director shall review all such requests and prepare a recommendation to the Mayor and City Council. Such requests shall be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Mayor And City Council and may be approved at the Mayor And City Council's sole discretion. The monetary value of an alternative equivalent must be equal to or exceed the cost to produce the required number of affordable housing units on site.
A.
Land Dedication and Off-Site Compliance Options. Upon a determination by the Director of Community Development that the criteria outlined in number 4 below have been met, a Residential Project may provide all or part of its Inclusionary Housing Component by means of the following options:
(1)
Dedication of Land to the City of Johns Creek at No Cost. Under this option, a developer may donate to the County a site on which all or a portion of the mandated inclusionary units can be built. The dedicated site must be located in the same planning area (as defined by the Comprehensive Plan) in unincorporated City of Johns Creek and must be physically suitable for development at the time of conveyance. It must be of sufficient size and properly zoned to accommodate the requisite number of units. It must already have access to water and sewer and public services (police, fire, etc.). The property should not have physical constraints that cause delay or increase construction costs (e.g., grading) or be unsuitable for residential development (e.g., contain toxins). The developer shall provide an appraisal of the land and its appraised value shall be confirmed by the County's Land Division of the General Services Department.
(2)
Development of Inclusionary Units Off-site. Inclusionary units may be constructed outside the Development Project within an Area ("Off-Site") for a Residential Project that is single-family or multifamily.
(3)
A Combination of Options (1) and (2).
(4)
Standard for Approval. The Director of Community Development may approve the proposal only if it provides a more cost-efficient solution to the Inclusionary Housing Component than the standard approach set forth in this Section, or if the location of Off-Site development would be superior to on-site development from the perspective of access to transportation or other applicable residential planning policies in the City of Johns Creek Comprehensive Plan.
(5)
Number of Inclusionary Units Credited to the Dedication or Off-Site Location. The number of Inclusionary Units credited to the dedication or Off-Site location will consist of the number of Inclusionary Units which can with reasonable degree of certainty be developed on the land, given (a) the mix of Inclusionary Unit sizes and type of structure in the Inclusionary Housing Plan; (b) densities permitted by applicable planning and zoning designations; and (c) site, infrastructure, environmental and other physical and planning constraints.
(6)
Site Suitability. The land proposed for dedication or for Off-Site location must be suitable from the perspective of size, configuration, physical characteristics, physical and environmental constraints, access, location, adjacent use, and other relevant planning criteria. The site must allow development of Inclusionary Units in a manner that complies with this Section including the over-concentration provisions set forth in Section 4.26.4.
(7)
Site Identification and Regulatory Status. The Developer must identify the proposed dedicated site or Off-Site location and the number of proposed Units to be credited thereby as part of the Inclusionary Housing Plan required in this Section. At the same time or before the Development Project receives its Inclusionary Incentives, the dedicated or Off-Site land shall have received all the Inclusionary Incentives necessary for development of the Inclusionary Units on such land. Unless the phasing plan requires otherwise, at the same time or before a Residential Project receives its first Project specific Entitlements, the dedicated or Off-Site land shall have received all the necessary Project-Level Approvals necessary for development of the Inclusionary Units on such land, and prior to the issuance of any Certificate of Occupancy for a Residential Project, the dedicated land or Off-Site land shall be fully served with the infrastructure necessary for residential development.
(8)
Director of Community Development Action. The Director of Community Development may recommend conditional approval or denial of the proposed land dedication or Off-Site development proposal. In reviewing the proposal, the Director of Community Development will consult with the Director of the Office of Housing. If the land dedication or the Off-Site proposal is accepted or accepted as modified, the relevant elements of the Inclusionary Housing Plan shall be included in the applicable Legislative Approvals for both the Residential Development generating the requirement for the Inclusionary Housing Component and, if applicable, the dedicated site or Off-Site Development Project where all or part of that requirement is proposed to be met. If the dedication or Off-Site proposal is rejected, the Inclusionary Housing Component shall be provided as set forth in this Section within the Development Project.
(9)
Implementation. As early as possible in the regulatory process, and in no case later than the negotiation of the Inclusionary Housing Agreement as provided in this Section, the Owner of the Residential Project must: (1) In the case of land dedication, provide an irrevocable offer of dedication for the dedicated site at no cost to the City of Johns Creek; and (2) In the case of Off-Site land, demonstrate to the Director of Community Development and the Office of Housing Director that the Off-Site location is and will remain committed to the timely development of the Inclusionary Units as provided in the Inclusionary Housing Plan. This commitment may be demonstrated through ownership of the Off-site location, or through adequate control of the use of the Off-site location through joint ownership, joint venture or other contractual means. If necessary to ensure that Inclusionary Housing Units are developed contemporaneously with the Market Rate Units, the Director of Community Development may require the offer of dedication or evidence of Off-Site control as early as the first Legislative Entitlement. With respect to an Off-site location, the Director of Community Development may also condition development or occupancy of the Residential Project on development or occupancy of the Off-Site Inclusionary Units, and the Inclusionary Housing Agreement must apply to and be recorded against both the Residential Project and the Off-Site land. With respect to dedicated land, the City of Johns Creek, upon acceptance of the offer of dedication, shall publish a request for proposal for development of the site(s), which will result in the production of the number of Inclusionary Units credited to the site(s).

Under this option, the developer may pay an amount equivalent to the cost of constructing the mandated units at the required affordability levels. Fees shall be calculated for the construction of affordable housing units for moderate and low and very low income households and shall be adjusted annually based upon the estimated average construction cost per square foot of floor area for single-family (not including the value of the improved lot) as estimated for the region (south) by the National Association of Home Builders or the American Apartment Association for multi-family development.
(2)
The County Manager shall establish an affordable Housing Trust Fund for the receipt and management of in-lieu housing fees. Monies received into the fund shall be utilized solely for the construction or purchase and maintenance of affordable housing and for the costs of administering programs consistent with the purposes of the section. In all cases, the required number of housing units at the required levels of affordability shall be provided for by this fund.
(3)
Fees must be paid within ten calendar days of issuance of a building permit for the Development or the permit will be null and void. For phased Developments, payments may be made for each portion of the Development within ten calendar days of the issuance of a Building Permit for that phase. When payment is delayed, in the event of default, or for any other reason, the amount of the in-lieu fee payable under this Section will be based upon the fee schedule in effect at the time the fee is paid.
(4)
No final inspection for occupancy will be completed for any corresponding Market-rate Unit in a Residential Development unless fees required under this Section have been paid in full to the Department of Community Development.
C.
Combined Dedication of Land and In-Lieu Housing Fees.

The Office of Housing shall also record a deed of trust encumbering any other monetary Inclusionary Incentives. The deed of trust, regulatory agreement, or covenant shall require that for a period of no less than 15 years, the unit may be resold to an income eligible purchaser. The full principal amount and interest will be due on sale to any non income eligible purchaser; due on change of use from an owner-occupied residential unit to any other use or if the Inclusionary Unit is rented; and due on any refinance of the Inclusionary Unit without the Office of Housing approval.

After the expiration of the 15 year affordability period, the homeowner must pay one half of the excess of the total resale price over the sum of: prior maximum sales price; a percentage of the affordable unit's prior purchase price with the cost of living increase since last sold; the fair market value documented capital improvements; and a reasonable sales and commission. If the amount remaining is less than $20,000, the amount due to the special revenue fund will be adjusted so the seller receives $10,000. If the amount is less than $10,000, the seller will receive the entire amount.
G.
The Office of Housing Guidelines. The County Manager's Office of Housing shall adopt guidelines for the administration of this program. The guidelines may provide for a graduated increase in the rate of increase of market value over the time of ownership of a for-sale Inclusionary Unit by one Owner or for forgiveness of all or a portion of the note(s) when (1) the resale value of the Inclusionary Unit falls below the market value of the unit at its last sale; or (2) the income-eligible owner occupies the unit for a substantial period of time.

The elements of the Inclusionary Housing Plan shall be incorporated into the terms and conditions of the applicable Project-specific Approvals.
C.
Inclusionary Housing Agreement.
1.
Requirement. No Development Agreement or Project-specific Approval may be issued by the City of Johns Creek without an executed Inclusionary Housing Agreement executed by the Owner, the Developer (if not Owner), and the Director of the Office of Housing acting with the advice of the Community Development Director. Recordation of the Agreement shall be a condition of approval of any Development Agreement, Disposition and Development Agreement or Project-level Approval.
2.
Timing. The Inclusionary Housing Agreement shall be negotiated concurrently with the processing of an application for the earlier of a Development Agreement or the first Project-specific Approval. At the request of the Developer, and if Developer makes the project development and financing details set forth below in subparagraphs 3 and 4 available, the Inclusionary Housing Agreement may be negotiated earlier in connection with the issuance of a Legislative Entitlement.
3.
Contents. The Agreement shall be consistent with the Inclusionary Housing Plan, and shall indicate: ownership or rental project, the number and size of Moderate, Very Low and Low income Units, the developer of the Inclusionary Units, the phasing and construction scheduling of the Units, commitments for Inclusionary Incentives, including Office of Housing commitments for Local Public Subsidy, and any other information required by the Office of Housing relative to the Inclusionary Housing Component. In the case of land dedication or Off-Site Inclusionary Housing, the Agreement shall also contain the information required in this Section.
4.
Information Required from Developer. The Developer of the Development Project shall present to Community Development and the Office of Housing: (1) plans, schematics, and details of phasing of the Residential Project as a whole including the Inclusionary Housing Component; (2) financial pro-forma for the Inclusionary Housing Component with sufficient economic information to allow for evaluation of feasibility, financing and equity sources and requirements, and rates of return; (3) the name and address of the entity which will develop the Inclusionary Housing Component if not Developer; (4) in the case of land dedication, an executed irrevocable offer of dedication at no cost; (5) in the case of Off-Site location, the evidence of site control required in this Section, and (6) any other information reasonably required by the Office of Housing in connection with the Agreement.
5.
Local Public Subsidy. The Developer of the Development Project may apply to the Office of Housing for Local Public Subsidy. Such an application shall contain the planning and financial information necessary to evaluate the eligibility and suitability of the project for Local Public Funding and shall include timetables or copies of proposals for External Subsidy. The application will be considered pursuant to the Office of Housing Multi Family Lending Guidelines, Office of Housing Single-Family Ownership Housing Financing Guidelines, and any Guidelines developed pursuant to this Section. The Office of Housing shall determine the Inclusionary Incentives it will make available in connection with the Residential Project as provided in this Section. The Inclusionary Housing Agreement shall specify the nature and amount of Local Public Funding. If the City of Johns Creek fails to make available the Inclusionary Incentives set forth in an executed and recorded Inclusionary Housing Agreement, the Residential Project shall be relieved of the portion of the Inclusionary Obligation that represents the percentage of local public funding committed in the Agreement but not provided. At the City of Johns Creek's option, the Agreement may provide that if the Local Public Funding component of the Inclusionary Incentives is delayed beyond the time provided for in the Agreement, the construction of Inclusionary Units may be deferred until funding availability, or that during the period of delay, the Owner may offer the Inclusionary Units as rental units at Market Rate until such time as the Local Public Funding indicated in the Agreement becomes available, at which time such rental units, upon being voluntarily vacated by existing market rate tenants, would be offered as Inclusionary Units.
6.
Incorporation into Project-level Approvals and Recordation. The Developer's obligations and the Inclusionary Incentives in the Agreement shall be incorporated into the Project-specific Approvals. The executed Agreement shall be recorded as a covenant running with the land against the real property of the Residential Project and, in the case of Off-Site Inclusionary Units, against the real property on which such Units are to be located.
D.
Administration of Affordability for Rental Inclusionary Housing. The Owner of rental Inclusionary Units shall be responsible for certifying the income of tenant to the Office of Housing at the time of initial rental and annually thereafter. The Owner of rental Inclusionary Units shall apply the same rental terms and conditions (except rent levels, deposits and income requirements) to tenants of Inclusionary Units as are applied to all other tenants, except as otherwise required to comply with government subsidy programs. Discrimination based on subsidies received by the prospective tenant is prohibited. The City of Johns Creek Office of Housing shall keep confidential the personal identifying information of the household members occupying an Inclusionary Unit.
E.
Guidelines. The Office of Housing Multi-family Development Financing Guidelines and the Office of Housing Single-Family Ownership Housing Financing Guidelines shall apply to Inclusionary Housing developed under this Section. The Director of Community Development and Office of Housing Director may jointly develop, and either of them may adopt, additional guidelines as necessary for the implementation of this Section consistent with the terms contained herein.

Administrative Fees. The City of Johns Creek Mayor and City Council may by ordinance establish reasonable fees and deposits for the administration of this Section.

Enforcement and Penalties.
