This Ordinance also seeks, among other things, to promote accepted design principles in areas of new development and redevelopment, to raise the level of community understanding and expectation for quality in the built environment, to protect and enhance local aesthetic and functional qualities, and to stimulate business and promote economic development.
In consideration of the character of the City of Johns Creek, these regulations are to monitor the suitability for certain uses, construction and design, prevent functional and visual disunity, promote desirable conditions for community and commerce and protect property against blight and depreciation.
