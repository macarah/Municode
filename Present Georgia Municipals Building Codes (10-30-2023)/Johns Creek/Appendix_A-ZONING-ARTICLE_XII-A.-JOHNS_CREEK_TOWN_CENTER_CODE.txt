new
12A.3.1. Applicability.
A.
The requirements of this Article apply to all parcels within the Town Center Overlay unless expressly stated otherwise in this Article.
B.
The requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, Development Regulations, and all other applicable City ordinance also apply in the Town Center Overlay unless expressly stated otherwise in this Article.
C.
This Article does not change the permitted use or density of a property within the Town Center Overlay. Land and structures must be used in accordance with the standards of the underlying zoning district.
D.
This Article does change the permitted form and design of a property subject to the Town Center Overlay. When requirements of this Article conflict with any other requirement of the Zoning Ordinance, the requirements of this Article shall prevail.
E.
When the word "street" is used in this Article it means both public and private streets unless stated otherwise.
12A.3.2. Block and Access.
12A.3.2.1. Block.
A.
Sites greater than 4 acres in size must incorporate existing or new streets or pedestrian corridors (minimum 20 feet wide and 20 feet high) that terminate at other existing or new streets or pedestrian corridors to form an interconnected network at the ground level with a maximum block perimeter length of 2,000 feet.
B.
In addition to the block standards above, blocks containing exclusively single-family dwellings must be wide enough to provide two tiers of lots, except where fronting on arterial streets prevented by topographical conditions or size of the property, in which case, the Community Development Director may require and/or approve a single tier of lots.
C.
Other than stub-out streets and alleys, dead-end streets are not allowed unless a variance is granted for topographic hardship.
D.
Block Measurement.
1.
A block is bounded by a public or private street (not including an alley).
2.
Block perimeter is measured along the edge of the property abutting the public or private streets, except for the measurement of dead-end streets, which are measured from intersecting centerlines.
3.
The Community Development Director may modify the block perimeter requirements when steep slopes in excess of 25%, pre-existing development, tree protection areas, stream buffers, open space, or easements would make the provision of a complete block infeasible.
4.
Where the block pattern is interrupted by public parkland, including greenways that are open and accessible to the public, pedestrian access points must be provided with a minimum length equal to half of the maximum block perimeter.
E.
No public streets, private streets or alleys within the Town Center Overlay shall be gated, unless it is used for security purposes related to light industrial uses.
12A.3.2.2. Access.
A.
General. When land is subdivided or otherwise developed, parcels and buildings must be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and must provide access to those areas not presently served by streets. No development may be designed to completely eliminate street access to abutting parcels without current street access.
B.
Stub-Out Streets.
1.
Stub-out streets within new development must be installed to meet the block standards of Section 12A.3.2.1.
2.
The stub-out street right-of-way, pavement, and curbing must extend to the boundary of the abutting parcel to the point where the connection to the anticipated street is expected.
3.
Where a stub-out street is provided, a sign noting the future street extension must be posted at the property owner's expense.
4.
Connecting to an existing stub-out street. If a stub-out street exists on an abutting parcel, the street system of any new development must connect to the stub-out street to form a through street.
C.
Exception. The Community Development Director may waive the requirement for a stub-out street or require pedestrian and bicycle-only access when steep slopes in excess of 25%, tree conservation areas, stream buffers, open space or easements would make the provision of a stub-out street infeasible.
12A.3.2.3. Vehicle Cross-Access. All lots must comply with the following standards:
A.
Internal vehicular circulation areas must be designed and installed to allow for cross-access between abutting lots.
B.
Vehicle cross-access shall not be gated.
C.
When an abutting lot is vacant or already developed, a stub for a future cross-access connection must be provided at the point where the connection to the abutting parcel is expected to occur in the future.
D.
If a cross-access driveway stub exists on an abutting parcel, the internal vehicular circulation area must connect to the stub to form a cross-access connection.
E.
When cross-access for vehicles is deemed impractical by the Public Works Director on the basis of topography, the presence of natural features, or vehicular safety factors, the requirement for cross access may be modified or waived. Bicycle and pedestrian connections must be provided between abutting properties when cross-access is waived.
F.
Property owners who establish cross-access easements must:
1.
Allow pedestrian and vehicular access to all properties on the same block face as the property owner establishing the cross-access. Pedestrian and vehicular access is contingent upon the granting of reciprocal vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian access rights to the granting property;
2.
Record an easement allowing cross-access to and from properties served by the cross-access easement;
3.
Record a joint maintenance agreement requiring each property owner to maintain the vehicular, bicycle, and/or pedestrian access areas on their lot;
4.
Contain a provision prohibiting the erection of fences, walls and other obstructions that prevent the use of vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian access ways;
5.
Include a statement that the cross-access agreement is conveyed with the land, is binding on all successors, heirs and assigns and that the easement rights are perpetual; and
6.
The cross-access agreement must be signed by all necessary owner(s) of the granting property.

2.
If a use is reduced in area, or wholly or partially becomes vacant, or is replaced by a use that requires less parking, no additional parking in-lieu fees are required.
3.
If a use is discontinued, the property owner may count its parking in-lieu fee spaces towards meeting the requirement of new uses built on-site.
4.
A change of ownership or the dividing or merging of lots will not affect parking in-lieu fees or any determination that parking requirements have been met according to fees paid for a particular use, except when the change of ownership results in one of the conditions identified in subsections 1 through 3 immediately above.
E.
