Sec. 113-147. - Street cuts.
(1)
Review of utility plans. All utility construction plans within city right-of-way shall be reviewed and approved by the department before construction begins. A traffic control plan may be required as part of the submittal. Street cuts shall not be allowed unless deemed absolutely necessary due to the presence of rock, the need to tap into an existing line beneath the road surface, or other circumstance which makes boring impossible or infeasible. Where open trenching has been permitted the trench width shall be the minimum width necessary to allow for the installation of the conduit and provide adequate compaction of the backfill material.
(2)
Marking of existing utilities. All existing utilities shall be properly marked in accordance with Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act prior to any excavation work.
(3)
Maintaining access to private properties. Access to private driveways shall be provided at all times except during working hours when construction operations prohibit provision of such access.
(4)
Obstruction of fire hydrants. Unobstructed access must be provided at all times to fire hydrants.
(5)
Lane closure. Contact the department of public works at least 24 hours in advance of closure of traffic lanes. The applicant will be responsible for ensuring notice has been received by public works and should utilize verified e-mail notification. All lane closures shall be properly marked and signed with certified flagmen when appropriate.
In trenching across the road, no more than one-half of the traveled way is to be closed to traffic at one time.
(6)
Maximum length of open trench. The trench construction shall not be opened for a distance of more than 300 feet at any one time, unless specifically authorized by the public works director.
(7)
Damage repair. Whenever a part of a block, square or section of curb, sidewalk, multi-use trail or driveway is broken or damaged by the person making any excavation or opening in or under any street, alley or public place, the entire block, square or section, shall be removed to the score, groove or saw cut line and replaced or reconstructed. Where the line of cut would be less than two feet from an existing expansion or weakened plan joint, the concrete shall be removed to said joint.
(8)
Trench construction and backfill.
Definitions and considerations. In trenched construction, bedding is the subgrade soil and its surface, as prepared to support the pipe. Backfill is the material refilling the rest of the level of top of pipe, and of overfill above that level. The latter may include restoration of surface soils or roadway materials. From the highway viewpoint, the essential features for trench and backfill construction are:
a.
Entrenched roadbed;
b.
Security of the pipe against deformation likely to cause leakage; and
c.
Assurance against drainage being blocked by the backfill. Bedding is important for all pipes.
Controls for trenched construction. Trenched construction, bedding, and backfill normally will be adequately controlled by the applicant conforming to the GDOT standard specifications for earth work and culverts as well as standards and details. Specific controls follow:
a.
Trenches are to be cut to have vertical faces with a maximum width of two feet or outside diameter of pipe plus 18 inches. They shall be shored where necessary to prevent caving and sloughing.
b.
Bedding shall be provided to a depth of 12 inches or half of the diameter of the pipe, whichever is the least. Bedding shall consist of granular soil free of lumps, clods, cobbles and frozen materials, and shall be graded to a firm-but-yeilding surface without abrupt changes in bearing value. Unstable soils and rock ledges shall be sub-excavated from the bedding zone and replaced by imported material. For carriers laid without encasement, the bedding shall be shaped to fit the bottom of the pipe for 60 percent of its width. See the GDOT standard specifications for additional information on backfill material.
c.
Backfilling of trenches must be accomplished immediately after the pipeline or other utility is placed therein or as directed by the director. Backfill shall be placed in two stages: first, sidefill to the level of the top of pipe; second, overfill to former surface grade. Sidefill shall consist of granular material laid in six-inch layers, each consolidated by mechanical tamping and controlled addition of moisture, to a density of 95 percent as determined by AASHTO method T-99 or GHD.
Overfill shall be layered and consolidated to match the compaction. The top 12 inches shall be compacted to 100 percent of specified density. Consolidation by saturation or ponding will not be permitted. Use 57 stone material or another GDOT type II material that is approved by the director in wet trenches, these materials shall be compacted like above stated backfill to a satisfactory uniform density as directed by the director.
(9)
Pavement cuts. No open cuts in pavement will be permitted except by special permission of the director when there is an emergency and the public health or safety is imperiled, or for making a service tap on a line under the pavement when no other distribution line is available in the area where the service is required. In no event will an open cut be permitted when it is reasonably practical to bore, tunnel, etc., under the surface of the roadway. Whenever the director is requested to authorize an open cut, such request must be made in writing supported by detailed reasons some other method is not practical and giving details relative to the maintenance history and service life of the facility. The department requires (1) that backfill and repaving be performed under its direction at the expense of the applicant and (2) that the applicant remain liable for cost of repair if the backfill subsides or the patched pavement fails. When approval of the director is granted, the following provisions shall be strictly adhered to.
a.
The trench edges in paved areas shall be sawed or cut to neat lines by methods satisfactory to the director before starting to break the pavement slab.
b.
Materials and methods of shall be adopted to achieve prompt restoration of traffic service.
1.
In trenching across the roadway, only one-half of the paved surface is to be opened at one time. The open half shall be completely backfilled before opening the other half.
2.
Closure of intersecting streets, road approaches, or other access points for trenching operations will not be permitted. Upon trenching across such facilities, the applicant shall utilize steel running plates, planks or other satisfactory methods for traffic entering or leaving the highway or adjacent properties. Immediately after the facility authorized by the permit has been placed, the intersecting streets, road approaches or other access facilities, shall be restored to at least as good condition as it was prior to the permit operations and in a manner satisfactory to the director. Spot resurfacing, (milling, grinding and/or additional asphalt) may be required.
Once the pavement is cut, it is most difficult to reconstruct to obtain the structural strength and surface quality the road and pavement had prior to cutting. For trenches over four feet wide, the subbase, base and paving shall be replaced in kind using construction procedures in accordance with the current GDOT standard specifications. For trenches up to four feet wide, the subbase, base and paving shall be replaced in kind using construction procedures in accordance with GDOT standard number 1401; except class A GDOT concrete will be used in place of class B or soil cement base and 9.5mm or 12.5mm superpave asphalt will be used or as determined by the director. Utility cuts in Portland cement concrete pavement are discouraged by the department. Pavement cuts, when allowed will require complete or partial slab replacement. The director will determine the extent of slab replacement on a case by case basis if an open cut is allowed. Procedures for slab removal and replacement will use construction procedures in accordance with the current GDOT standard specifications and standard number 1401, also including but not limited to surface tolerance requirements set forth in the current GDOT standard specifications.
Any pavement cuts that are not perpendicular to the roadway's horizontal alignment for asphalt highways shall require the entire width of the roadway to be resurfaced with a minimum of two inches of asphalt that is the same material as the existing surface or as determined by the director in addition to the requirements stated hereinbefore. Any pavement cuts that are not perpendicular to the roadway's horizontal alignment for Portland cement concrete pavement shall be in accordance with the current GDOT standard specifications and standard number 1401. Any manhole or valve shall have a square concrete pad placed around the facility if the facility is located in the traveled way as determined by the director and to the satisfaction of the director.
(10)
Sidewalk, multi-use trail and curb cut replacement. All sidewalk, multi-use trail and curb cuts require that the section of sidewalk, multi-use trail and/or curb be replaced from existing joint to existing joint or as determined by the director. All sidewalk, multi-use trail and curb construction shall meet the construction requirements as shown in section 441 of the current GDOT standard specifications or as determined by the director.
(11)
Replacement of cuts in unpaved streets.
a.
The trench shall be backfilled in accordance with the manner prescribed in this Article for backfilling of trenches. The surface treatment shall match that of the existing road. For gravel roads the trench shall be backfilled up to and within four inches of the street level. The remaining four inches shall be filled up with no. 2 crushed stone, well compacted into place.
b.
The base stone shall be kept at street level by the contractor until final acceptance of the project of the city engineer without additional cost to the city.
(12)
Public utility extensions. Contact the department of public works for public utility extension information from the existing utility locations to the proposed development.
