ARTICLE II. - BYLAWS OF BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 2-39. - Membership.
The board of commissioners shall consist of five members, who have been previously elected and sworn in as members of such board.
(Code 1983, § 2-2-16)
Sec. 2-40. - Officers.
The principal officers of the board of commissioners shall consist of a chair, who was elected and designated as such by the voters of the county, a vice-chair and a vice-chair pro tempore, who shall be elected from the membership of the said board at its first regular meeting in January of each year. A majority vote of the members of the board of commissioners shall be required for the election of the vice-chair and the vice-chair pro tempore.
(Code 1983, § 2-2-17)
Sec. 2-41. - Powers and duties of chair.
(a)
The chair shall be the chief executive officer of the county government and shall generally supervise, direct and control the administration of the affairs of the county pursuant to the powers conferred upon him by law and pursuant to any adopted resolution of the board of commissioners in regard to matters reserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of the commission.
(b)
The chair shall preside over all meetings of the commission wherein he is present.
(Code 1983, § 2-2-18)
Sec. 2-42. - Code of conduct; governing authority of county.
The members of the Ware County Board of County Commissioners recognize that, when acting as a body, they are the governing authority of Ware County, Georgia. As a board they possess the full power of local government, both legislative, executive and quasijudicial, within the parameters established by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia. As individual commissioners, however, each member acknowledges that he has no legal power or authority, and that official action can exist only by majority vote of the board. Accordingly, it is important and in the public interest to establish a code of conduct for county commissioners that addresses conduct both during and outside of public meetings. The ordinance from which this section is derived is adopted in order to preserve the integrity of local government, to promote the efficiency with which local government services are provided, and to protect the county from exposure to liability due to conduct that is unauthorized, ultra vires, or in excess of a commissioner's authority.
(Ord. of 1-10-2005)
State Law reference— Code of ethics for government service, O.C.G.A. § 45-10-1 et seq.
Sec. 2-43. - Conduct—During meetings.
During the public portions of public meetings and public hearings, members of the Ware County Board of Commissioners shall not:
(1)
Speak without first being recognized by the chair;
(2)
Interrupt anyone who has the floor;
(3)
Use profanity during the public portion of any meeting;
(4)
Refuse to yield the floor, or argue with the chair, if he is ruled out of order by the chair;
(5)
Make disparaging remarks about any person's character during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to say "I don't believe that" or "I cannot accept that," but it is improper to say "He's a liar," or "He can't be trusted." Remarks should be limited to the subject under discussion, and shall not address the character of the person involved. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session.
(6)
Confront anyone about a prior statement in an accusatory manner during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask someone if something different had been said on a prior occasion, and the question should be phrased "Did you tell me _______?" or "Do you remember telling me _______?" It is impermissible to say "Didn't you tell me _______?" or "Why did you tell me _______ before the meeting?" The purpose of the public portion of a commissioner's meeting is to allow each commissioner, county representative and members of the public to state their positions in an orderly fashion; it is not a trial where persons are to be cross examined, interrogated, belittled or held out for public ridicule or embarrassment. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session.
(7)
State during the public portion of any meeting that a county employee has not done his or her job, or has not done his or her job properly. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask if a county employee did or did not do a specific task, but the question must be phrased in such a way that a simple "yes" or "no" answer is all that is requested. It would also be permissible to state or comment that a job was not done, or that it was not done correctly, so long as the person responsible is not singled out for blame; remarks concerning the subject or job performance are proper but negative references to the person responsible are not. It is not proper to accuse county employees of not doing their jobs, or doing them improperly, during the public portion of the meetings. County employees shall not be placed in the position of responding to accusations of wrongdoing by a commissioner during the public portion of a meeting (unless the meeting has been called as a hearing for the express purpose of determining disciplinary action), nor shall their integrity or competency be challenged by a commissioner during the public portion of any meeting. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate or these matters in executive closed session.
(8)
Represent their personal position or beliefs as being the position or beliefs of the board as a whole. By way of example, unless and until a majority vote has been obtained on a specific issue, a commissioner shall not state that the board will or will not do something, nor shall a commissioner state what the board's vote will be on an issue. No single commissioner can speak on behalf of the board unless specifically authorized by majority vote to do so.
(9)
Refuse to recognize the validity of action approved by a majority vote of the board. By way of example, a commissioner is free to state that he does not agree with the majority vote, or that he would like to see the majority reconsider its action and vote a different way. However, a commissioner shall not refuse to sign any ordinance, resolution, contract or other legal document because he did not vote for the action taken. The minutes shall reflect his opposition to the majority's decision, but he shall not be authorized to withhold his signature on the basis that he did not vote for the action taken.
(10)
Divulge the subject matter of any confidential information, legal advice or strategy discussions revealed during an executive session called for the purpose of discussing actual or potential litigation against the county or any county employee. There may be occasions when a commissioner will be asked to make specific commitment to this rule in connection with a particular case. If a commissioner is unwilling to pledge his commitment to the other members of the board, he shall be excluded from participating in that portion of the executive session.
(Ord. of 1-10-2005, § I)
Sec. 2-44. - Same—Outside of meetings.
A member of the Ware County Board of Commissioners shall not:
(1)
Direct any department head or county employee to do a job or perform a task. All such requests shall be made to the county manager. Once such a request is made, the commissioners shall follow-up with the county manager regarding the performance of the work, not with the department head or county employee whom the commissioner expects to do the job. If the job is not performed to the commissioner's satisfaction, this shall be taken up with the county manager first; if the commissioner is still not satisfied, the matter shall next be discussed with all members of the board of commissioners in executive session, under the exemption to the Open Meetings Act for discussion of employee performance. There shall be no criticism or disparaging remarks made about any county employee in a public meeting unless and until all of these steps have been exhausted.
(2)
Publicly state that he intends to fire or discipline any county employee. No single commissioner has the authority to hire or fire county personnel.
(3)
Reprimand any county employee. If a commissioner believes a county employee should be reprimanded, he shall so inform the county manager. If a commissioner believes the county manager should be reprimanded, he shall notify the other members of the board of commissioners. No single commissioner has the authority to discipline county personnel.
(4)
Use profanity, insulting or demeaning words about a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee.
(5)
Call into question the qualifications or competency of a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee. Concern of this nature shall be addressed in the stages outlined in subsection (1) of this section.
(6)
Demand that the county manager or any department head stop what he or she is doing and immediately attend to the commissioner's business. If the county manager or a department head requests that the commissioner schedule a time to discuss a matter that is mutually convenient to all concerned, the commissioner shall honor that request.
(7)
Promise on behalf of the county or the board of commissioners to undertake any act or to pass any ordinance, resolution, contract or agreement. A single commissioner has no authority to bind the board of commissioners.
(8)
Agree to buy or sell anything of value on behalf of the county without advance approval by a majority vote of the board of commissioners.
(9)
Attempt to negotiate county business with any private party or a representative of another governmental unit without the advance approval of a majority of the board of commissioners. By way of example, it is permissible for a commissioner to discuss county business in general terms with private parties and representatives of other governmental units (unless there is actual or threatened litigation against Ware County by the parties involved). However, a commissioner shall not make any written offers, draft any agreements, edit or revise any proposed agreements or plans or suggest or propose (whether orally or in writing) any specific terms concerning money or services to be provided or received by the county unless that commissioner has received expressed authorization in advance by a majority vote of the board of commissioners. The fact that the subject matter involves property or persons in a commissioner's district is of no consequence, as a commissioner has no additional legal authority over a matter simply because it is in his district.
(10)
Speak to any representatives of the news media on behalf of the county or the board of commissioners without advance approval by majority vote of the board of commissioners. By way of example, a commissioner is free to express his personal views or opinions to anyone. However, a commissioner shall not make a statement in the name of the board of commissioners or in the name of Ware County unless he has been authorized in advance to do so by majority vote of the board of commissioners.
(Ord. of 1-10-2005, § II)
Sec. 2-45. - Penalties.
(a)
The board of commissioners shall have the responsibility to police itself and to enforce the ordinance from which this section and sections 2-42—2-44 are derived. Any commissioner shall have the right to bring a suspected violation of the ordinance from which this section and sections 2-42—2-44 are derived to the attention of the full board. Any such accusation may be deliberated upon in executive session, but a vote upon any penalty to be imposed must be taken in open, public session, with all members of the board present. If the board determines by majority vote that a violation of the ordinance from which this section and sections 2-42—2-44 are derived has occurred, the board shall have the authority to impose one or more of the following penalties upon the offending commissioner:

The sanction shall last for a period of up to one year from the date of the offense.
(4)
A fine, not to exceed $500.00 per offense, which shall be paid by the offending commissioner to the general fund of Ware County, Georgia, within ten days of the board's vote establishing a violation; if the offending commissioner fails to make this payment within the time specified herein, the amount of the penalty shall be withheld from the offending commissioner's compensation as a commissioner.
(b)
The decision of the Ware County Board of Commissioners on any question concerning a violation of the ordinance from which this section and sections 2-42—2-44 are derived, or the penalty imposed, shall be final, it being the express intent of all the commissioners to govern themselves, and not to abdicate this responsibility to any other person or entity.

Any meeting had in such manner shall in all instances be an official called meeting.

Called meetings by the vice-chair may be had in any situation during the physical absence of the chair, provided proper written notice is given to all members of the board in accordance with this article and subject to the same terms as are required for called meetings by the chair, and any such meetings so called must reflect the unanimous approval and consent of all members of the board present that the meeting was necessary and that the chair was in fact physically absent from the county. Waiver of such notice in writing by all the remaining members of the board will suffice in lieu of prior written notice. In such event, said called meeting would then have the power to transact business in all respects as an official meeting of said board to the same extent as if the meeting had been called by the chair and he had been physically present and presided over said meeting.
