(a)
Preparation.
(1)
Strip and properly stockpile all sod and topsoil suitable for reuse in restoration. Protect until use.
(2)
Remove pavement only as necessary for excavating the trench and installing the pipelines and appurtenances. Cut all asphalt pavement in straight, uniform lines by means of a jack hammer or suitable pavement cutter. Cut all concrete pavements to a depth of at least two inches along the cut line with a rotary saw, after which the pavement may be broken with a jack hammer or suitable pavement cutter.
(3)
Determine location of existing utilities (underground and overhead utility lines, poles, pipes, services, structures, etc.) and mark them in advance of trenching operations. Furnish and have available at all times an electronic pipe detector in working order, and use said detector to survey the proposed path of excavation. Excavate and expose underground utilities in test pits to verify the locations, depths, materials of construction. Notify the city of potential conflicts and presence of cathodic protected facilities. No extra compensation will be given for manual excavation required to locate, protect or restore underground utilities.
(b)
Trench excavation.
(1)
Excavate all subsurface material within the trenching limits specified regardless of the material encountered, including rock. Excavated materials satisfying the requirements of this section for native material suitable for backfill may be used for final backfill. Remove surplus excavated material and unsuitable materials from the job site.
(2)
Do not excavate in areas of excessive groundwater until sufficient dewatering equipment, in good working order, is available at the site. In all cases, continuously remove water accumulated in trenches prior to installing bedding or laying pipes. Provide de-watering by pumping or well pointing, as determined by the contractor, as required to achieve dry ditches and continuously maintain a water level two feet below the trench bottom. All water pumped, bailed, or otherwise removed from the excavation shall be conveyed to a suitable discharge point and disposed in a manner that neither violates regulatory requirements nor causes injury to public health, property, work completed, work in progress, or creates a public nuisance of any type.
(3)
Excavate the banks of trenches vertical from bottom of trench to one foot above the top of the pipe or conduit.
(4)
Keep the trench width within the limits specified below; however, OSHA safety requirements shall supersede the requirements stated herein whenever applicable and shall be followed:
a.
Maximum trench width at top of pipe: Pipe outside diameter (O.D.) plus 24 inches. If the maximum trench width is exceeded, the required bedding must be upgraded to the next higher class, at the contractor's expense, for that part of trench that exceeds the maximum allowable width.
b.
Minimum width of trench: O.D. of bell or coupling plus 16 inches. (This minimum applies to all trenches including those in rock excavation.)
(5)
Place excavated material (spoil) sufficiently back from the edge of trench to prevent caving of the trench wall and to permit safe access along the trench. Provide at least three feet clear from toe of spoil bank on at least one side of trench for access. Do not endanger the workers, the public, or obstruct roadways or sidewalks. Comply with OSHA trench safety standards at all times.
(6)
Do not excavate more than 400 feet in advance of pipe laying. Unless prior approval is obtained from the city, limit the length of open trench to that which can be completed in one working day.
(7)
Do not leave trenches open overnight unless there are extenuating circumstances approved by the city, and the excavations are fully protected by safe and effective barricades, fencing and lights. Provide precast concrete barriers equal to those specified by Georgia DOT Standard Specifications, section 622.
(8)
Where necessary, and as required by OSHA regulations, provide and install sufficient and suitably sized movable trench boxes, shields, sheeting, shoring and/or bracing which shall remain in place until the backfill has proceeded to a point where it can be removed safely. When damage is liable to result from withdrawing sheeting, it shall remain in place. Movable shields, sheeting, shoring, bracing, etc. are considered as an integral part of the work and no extra payment will be allowed.
(9)
Where necessary to place excavated material or spoil on paved streets or parking lots, first provide a thick underlayment of straw matting on the pavement to receive excavated material or spoil. Sweep the pavement clean upon removal of the excavated material or spoil.
(10)
Remove rock encountered in trench excavation for the specified minimum width of the trench (but not less than 30 inches in width) and to a depth of six inches below the invert of the pipe.
(11)
Obtain all required permits for handling explosives and performing blasting. Conduct blasting operations in strict accordance with all existing ordinances and regulations and only with the prior approval of the city. Carefully protect all exposed structures from the effects of blasts and cover all blasts with heavy timbers, mats or other suitable protection. Blasting shall be done only by licensed personnel. Use very light charges to prevent damage to adjacent structures. Promptly repair any damage. Store all blasting supplies in accordance with local ordinances. In no case shall caps or other explosives be kept at the place where dynamite or other explosives are stored.
(12)
As trenching approaches existing underground utilities, perform excavation with extreme care. Perform necessary removals, relocations, or relaying of pipes, utility lines, and appurtenances which will obstruct the work. Provide temporary support, adequate protection, and maintenance of all underground and surface utilities, drains, structures, or other obstructions encountered.
(13)
Promptly correct damage to existing utilities or structures caused by construction activities. Promptly restore disrupted utility service and provide a condition at least equal to the original condition before the damage occurred. Should the contractor fail to promptly restore service or correct damage, the city or utility companies may correct the damage and back-charge the contractor for costs incurred for the required corrective work.
(14)
Where existing storm drains or culverts are damaged or destroyed by removal to facilitate trenching and pipe laying, replace the damaged or destroyed drains or culverts with new reinforced concrete pipe meeting the requirements of ASTM Designation C76-04, Class II. Drainpipe shall be equal to that removed except sizes smaller than 12 inches which shall be replaced with 12-inch pipe.
(15)
If trench subgrade is found to contain unsuitable or potentially corrosive material, such as ashes, cinders, refuse, petroleum contaminated soil or organic matter, immediately stop trenching and pipe installation until further notice and notify the city. PVC pipe will not be suitable where susceptible to permeation by certain organic contaminants and shall be replaced by ductile iron pipe. Undercut and remove all unsuitable or potentially corrosive material at least six inches below the trench bottom and replace with granular bedding material.

(2)
Grade the trench bottom to provide a firm, uniform, and continuous bearing all along the entire length of the barrel of the pipe. Excavate bell holes no larger than necessary to allow joint assembly and to ensure that the pipe barrel will lie flat on the trench bottom. Pipe bells or couplings shall not support any load. Where trench excavation is carried below or beyond required limits, backfill the over-excavated space with specified bedding material.
(3)
In areas of rock excavation, and where needed in other areas, provide compacted granular bedding material cushion across the full width of the excavation to a minimum six-inch depth under the pipe, fittings, valves, manholes, or other structures.
(4)
Whenever the subgrade is unstable or too soft to provide a satisfactory foundation for any pipe, de-water and undercut as necessary and stabilize with stone. Compact and bring the trench bottom to proper grade to create a firm, unyielding stabilized subgrade for bedding material and/or pipe.
(d)
Backfill.
(1)
General. Backfill and compact all trenches and excavations immediately after the pipe or appurtenance has been installed.
(2)
Initial backfill and embedment. Place select backfill around haunches of the pipe and appurtenance by hand placement and compaction, from the trench bottom up to the springline of the pipe. Place embedment materials by methods that will not disturb or damage the pipe. Continue initial embedment of the pipe to at least six inches above the pipe crown or to the dimensions shown on the bedding detail. Use no stone larger than three-fourths-inch maximum dimension in the embedment. Compact the initial backfill and embedment firmly and evenly, but without use of mechanical compactors.
(3)
Remaining or final backfill. Unless otherwise specified or shown on the drawings, use excavated native material suitable for backfill for the final, or general backfilling. If sufficient and suitable native material suitable for general backfill is not available on site, furnish sufficient and suitable borrow material from an approved source. Place backfill from top of initial backfill up to the trench surface as described herein. Do not place rocks larger than 12 inches in maximum dimension in the upper layer of backfill unless otherwise approved by the city.
a.

Place the stone backfill to achieve six-inch compacted layers at 95 percent standard proctor density. Use mechanical tamping to achieve the required compaction. In paved roadways also install and compact the specified pavement base material to the required thickness as shown on the pavement replacement detail. Install a temporary traffic surface at grade consisting of two inches compacted depth of crushed stone or pug mix. Leave backfilled trench open to traffic and maintain the surface at a uniform grade by refilling with stone and re-compacting as necessary to remedy any settlement. Continue such maintenance, including dust control, until surface paving is authorized by the city.
b.
Trenches in drainage ditches or other areas subject to erosion. Unless otherwise specified, backfill trenches with native material suitable for backfill and mechanically compact in six-inch layers to achieve 95 percent standard proctor density per ASTM D698. Refill and re-compact eroded or settled trenches as often as necessary to restore and maintain the surface at the required finished grade. Immediately stabilize the surface against erosion.
c.
Trenches in areas to be grassed or landscaped. Unless otherwise specified, backfill trenches with native material suitable for backfill and compact by methods of the contractor's choice to achieve at least 85 percent standard proctor density per ASTM D698. However, if the trench is on DOT or railroad rights-of-way, compact to the density specified in the applicable permit. Refill and re-compact settled trenches as often as necessary to restore and maintain the trench surface at the required finished grade.
(e)
Field quality control.
(1)
Perform routine quality control compaction testing at a frequency sufficient to ensure adequate compaction throughout the trenching and backfilling.
(2)
In streets, paved areas, or areas to be paved, perform compaction testing of the underlying backfill prior to placing pavement base material.
