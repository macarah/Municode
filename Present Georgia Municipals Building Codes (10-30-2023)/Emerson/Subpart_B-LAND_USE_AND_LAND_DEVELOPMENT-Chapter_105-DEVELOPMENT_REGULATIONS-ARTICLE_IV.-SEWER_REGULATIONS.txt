DIVISION 3. - DESIGN CRITERIA AND MATERIALS FOR SEWERS

Sec. 105-537. - General.
The criteria listed herein is not intended to cover all aspects of design, but rather to mention the basic guidelines and those particulars that are required by the city water department. For more detailed criteria, the reader should refer to standard references such as Ten States Standards, Georgia EPD rules, Water Pollution Environment Federation Manual of Practice No. FD-5, and other available literature.
(Ord. No. 2017-005, § 403.1, 4-24-2017)
Sec. 105-538. - Types of sewers.
All sewers for the conveyance of wastewater shall be designed as separate sanitary sewers in which groundwater, stormwater or other runoff from roofs, streets, parking lots, foundation drains and any source other than wastewater are excluded. Overflows from sewers shall not be permitted.
(Ord. No. 2017-005, § 403.2, 4-24-2017)
Sec. 105-539. - Design period.
Gravity sewer pipelines should, as a minimum, be designed with capacity sufficient to handle the estimated tributary population. Tributary population is considered to be all areas upstream of the discharge point of the system being designed as well as any anticipated pumped flow from other basins. Sewers will be designed and installed to the uppermost property line of the development being served. Consideration should be given to the maximum anticipated capacity of institutions, industrial parks, etc.
(Ord. No. 2017-005, § 403.3, 4-24-2017)
Sec. 105-540. - Capacity and size determination.
(a)
In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the following factors should be considered:
(1)
Maximum hourly sewage flow.
(2)
Additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants.
(3)
Groundwater infiltration.
(4)
Topography of the area.
(5)
Depth of excavation.
(b)
New sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than 400 gallons per household per day. Normally, all sewers shall be designed for a peak flow of not less than 2½ times the average flow; this peak factor will be higher for smaller basins (see design guides). Sewers should be designed to carry the peak flow when flowing at a depth of two-thirds pipe diameter. The city land use plan should be consulted and special consideration given to commercial and industrial areas. Where developers are installing major trunk lines or interceptor sewers, the city's long range plan should be consulted as a guide and the sewer should, as a minimum, be of the size called for in the long range plan.
(c)
If proposed land use conditions have changed subsequent to the plan, these changes should be factored into the determination.
(Ord. No. 2017-005, § 403.4, 4-24-2017)
Sec. 105-541. - Special city requirements.
(a)
Distance between manholes. Maximum distance between manholes shall be 400 feet.
(b)
Depth. Any sewers installed in the street shall, topography permitting, be sufficiently deep to provide five feet of cover over service laterals at the street right-of-way, and over any part of the main or service within the street right-of-way. The maximum depth for PVC pipe shall be 15 feet, depths in excess of this shall be ductile iron. Sewers installed in streets shall have maximum depth of 12 feet. Any sewers on off street easements shall have a minimum of three feet of cover unless ductile iron pipe is used. Filling over the pipe to obtain minimum cover is not allowed.
(c)
Drop across manholes. All manholes shall be provided with a minimum vertical drop across the manhole (between in and out pipes) of 0.20 feet.
(d)
Detection tape. Detection tape shall be installed over all sewer pipes. Bury tape 18 to 24 inches below grade. Use detection wire on all service laterals.
(Ord. No. 2017-005, § 403.5, 4-24-2017)
Sec. 105-542. - Slope.
(a)
All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two feet per second based on Manning's formula using an "n" value of 0.013. The following are the minimum slopes, which should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable:
EXPAND
Sewer Size Minimum Slope in Feet Per 100 Feet
8" 0.40
10" 0.29
12" 0.22
14" 0.17
15" 0.15
16" 0.14
18" 0.12
21" 0.10
24" 0.08
  (b)
These minimum slopes will be used only when sufficient flows are expected to maintain a velocity of two feet per second and maintain a cleaning action in the line. Sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sewers on 20 percent slope or greater shall be ductile iron pipe and shall be anchored securely with concrete anchors (see Standard Details) to prevent displacement by erosion or shock. Maximum slope of sewers shall be 30 percent and sewers shall be designed at less than 20 percent whenever possible.
(Ord. No. 2017-005, § 403.6, 4-24-2017)

Sec. 105-554. - Laundry interceptors; applications, design requirements.
(a)
Typical applications include commercial/institutional laundromats and dry-cleaners. The waste discharge from these facilities usually contains high quantities of lint, silt, dissolved and suspended solids, as well as detergents.
(b)
A lint interceptor is commonly referred to as a "lint trap," typically located outside of the building and buried below grade. The principal advantage is the cooling effect obtained by the earth. The buried interceptor is typically constructed of precast concrete, providing years of continuous service. The interceptor contains several compartments where the lint will coagulate and float to the surface and heavier solids will sink to the bottom. The discharging effluent comprises of the clearer water between these layers.
(c)
Design standards are minimum requirements. It shall be the responsibility of the user/owner/generator to install properly sized interceptors to ensure compliance with the city sewer use ordinance.
(d)

In traffic areas, the trap shall be designed to have adequate reinforcement and cover (including piping), meeting HS-20 traffic loading specifications. Lint traps in traffic areas require a concrete driving surface over piping with structural backfill around piping. Effluent sample wells are required.
(e)
The different variables include number of washing machines, wastewater flow rate, wastewater detention time, and storage factor and detention time. Commercial laundries, laundromats, and dry-cleaners shall be equipped with an interceptor in order to reduce the quantity of lint and silt that enters the collection system. The system must be of adequate size and design to allow for cool-down of wastewater so that separation can be more readily achieved. In addition, the interceptor must be "equipped with a wire basket or similar device, removable for cleaning, that prevents passage into the drainage system of solids 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) or larger in size, string, rags, buttons or other materials detrimental to the public sewerage system." (1003.6 International Plumbing Code 2003). Sizing must be in accordance with guidance found in the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC), Appendix H which uses the following formula:
(TGC) x (CPH) x (RT) x (ST) = Size of Lint Interceptor (gallons)
Where:
TGC = Total Gallons per Cycle;
CPH = Cycles per hour;
RT = Retention time;
2.5 for Institutional Laundry;
2.0 for Standard Commercial Laundry;
1.5 for Light Commercial Laundry;
ST = Storage Factor, based on hours of operation;
1.0 for eight hours of operation;
1.5 for 12 or more hours.

(Ord. No. 2017-005, § 404.1, 4-24-2017)
Sec. 105-575. - Trenching, backfilling and compaction.
(a)
Preparation. The following steps are included in preparation:
(1)
Strip and properly stockpile all sod and topsoil suitable for reuse in restoration. Protect until use.
(2)
Remove pavement only as necessary for excavating the trench and installing the pipelines and appurtenances. Cut all asphalt pavement in straight, uniform lines by means of a jack hammer or suitable pavement cutter. Cut all concrete pavements to a depth of at least two inches along the cut line with a rotary saw, after which the pavement may be broken with a jack hammer or suitable pavement cutter.
(3)
Determine location of existing utilities (underground and overhead utility lines, poles, pipes, services, structures, etc.) and mark them in advance of trenching operations. Furnish and have available at all times an electronic pipe detector in working order, and use said detector to survey the proposed path of excavation. Excavate and expose underground utilities in test pits to verify the locations, depths, and materials of construction. Notify the city of potential conflicts and presence of cathodic protected facilities. No extra compensation will be given for manual excavation required to locate, protect or restore underground utilities.
(b)
Trench excavation. The following steps are included in excavation:
(1)
Excavate all subsurface material within the trenching limits specified regardless of the material encountered, including rock. Excavated materials satisfying the requirements of this section for native material suitable for backfill may be used for final backfill. Remove surplus excavated material and unsuitable materials from the job site.
(2)
Do not excavate in areas of excessive groundwater until sufficient de-watering equipment, in good working order, is available at the site. In all cases, continuously remove water accumulated in trenches prior to installing bedding or laying pipes. Provide de-watering by pumping or well-pointing, as determined by the contractor, as required to achieve dry ditches and continuously maintain a water level two feet below the trench bottom. All water pumped, bailed, or otherwise removed from the excavation shall be conveyed to a suitable discharge point and disposed of in a manner that neither violates regulatory requirements nor causes injury to public health, property, work completed, work in progress, or creates a public nuisance of any type.
(3)
Excavate the banks of trenches vertical from bottom of trench to one foot above the top of the pipe or conduit.
(4)
Keep the trench width within the limits specified below; however, OSHA safety requirements shall supersede the requirements stated herein whenever applicable and shall be followed:
a.
Maximum trench width at top of pipe. Pipe outside diameter (O.D.) plus 24 inches. If the maximum trench width is exceeded, the required bedding must be upgraded to the next higher class, at the contractor's expense, for that part of the trench that exceeds the maximum allowable width.
b.
Minimum width of trench. O.D. of bell or coupling plus 16 inches. (This minimum applies to all trenches including those in rock excavation.)
(5)
Place excavated material (spoil) sufficiently back from the edge of trench to prevent caving of the trench wall and to permit safe access along the trench. Provide at least three feet clear from toe of spoil bank on at least one side of trench for access. Do not endanger the workers, the public, or obstruct roadways or sidewalks. Comply with OSHA trench safety standards at all times.
(6)
Do not excavate more than 400 feet in advance of pipe laying. Unless prior approval is obtained from the city, limit the length of open trench to that which can be completed in one working day.
(7)
Do not leave trenches open overnight unless there are extenuating circumstances approved by the city, and the excavations are fully protected by safe and effective barricades, fencing and lights. Provide precast concrete barriers equal to those specified by Georgia DOT Standard Specifications, Section 622.
(8)
Where necessary, and as required by OSHA regulations, provide and install sufficient and suitably sized movable trench boxes, shields, sheeting, shoring and/or bracing which shall remain in place until the backfill has proceeded to a point where it can be removed safely. When damage is liable to result from withdrawing sheeting, it shall remain in place. Movable shields, sheeting, shoring, bracing, etc. are considered as an integral part of the work and no extra payment will be allowed.
(9)
Where necessary to place excavated material or spoil on paved streets or parking lots, first provide a thick underlayment of straw matting on the pavement to receive excavated material or spoil. Sweep the pavement clean upon removal of the excavated material or spoil.
(10)
Remove rock encountered in trench excavation for the specified minimum width of the trench (but not less than 30-inch width) and to a depth of six inches below the invert of the pipe.
(11)
Obtain all required permits for handling explosives and performing blasting. Conduct blasting operations in strict accordance with all existing ordinances and regulations and only with the prior approval of the city. Carefully protect all exposed structures from the effects of blast and cover all blasts with heavy timbers, mats or other suitable protection. Blasting shall be done only by licensed personnel. Use very light charges to prevent damage to adjacent structures. Promptly repair any damage. Store all blasting supplies in accordance with local ordinances. In no case shall caps or other explosives be kept at the place where dynamite or other explosives are stored.
(12)
As trenching approaches existing underground utilities, perform excavation with extreme care. Perform necessary removals, relocations, or relaying of pipes, utility lines, and appurtenances which will obstruct the work. Provide temporary support, adequate protection, and maintenance of all underground and surface utilities, drains, structures, or other obstructions encountered.
(13)
Promptly correct damage to existing utilities or structures caused by construction activities. Promptly restore disrupted utility service and provide a condition at least equal to the original condition before the damage occurred. Should the contractor fail to promptly restore service or correct damage, the city or utility companies may correct the damage and back-charge the contractor for costs incurred for the required corrective work.
(14)
Where existing storm drains or culverts are damaged or destroyed by removal to facilitate trenching and pipe laying, replace the damaged or destroyed drains or culverts with new reinforced concrete pipe meeting the requirements of ASTM Designation C76-04, Class II. Drain pipe shall be equal to that removed except sizes smaller than 12 inches which shall be replaced with 12-inch pipe.
(15)
If trench subgrade is found to contain unsuitable or potentially corrosive material, such as ashes, cinders, refuse, petroleum contaminated soil or organic matter, immediately stop trenching and pipe installation until further notice and notify the city. PVC pipe will not be suitable where susceptible to permeation by certain organic contaminants and shall be replaced by ductile iron pipe. Undercut and remove all unsuitable or potentially corrosive material at least six inches below the trench bottom and replace with granular bedding material.
(c)
Bedding and embedment. The following requirements are to be included for bedding and embedment:

(2)
Grade the trench bottom to provide a firm, uniform, and continuous bearing all along the entire length of the barrel of the pipe. Excavate bell holes no larger than necessary to allow joint assembly and to ensure that the pipe barrel will lie flat on the trench bottom. Pipe bells or couplings shall not support any load. Where trench excavation is carried below or beyond required limits, backfill the over-excavated space with specified bedding material.
(3)
In areas of rock excavation, and where needed in other areas, provide compacted Granular Bedding Material cushion across the full width of the excavation to a minimum six-inch depth under the pipe, fittings, valves, manholes, or other structures.
(4)
Whenever the subgrade is unstable or too soft to provide a satisfactory foundation for any pipe, de-water and undercut as necessary and stabilize with stone. Compact and bring the trench bottom to proper grade to create a firm, unyielding stabilized subgrade for bedding material and/or pipe.
(d)
Backfill. The following steps are included in backfilling:
(1)
General. Backfill and compact all trenches and excavations immediately after the pipe or appurtenance has been installed.
(2)
Initial backfill and embedment. Place select backfill around haunches of the pipe and appurtenance by hand placement and compaction, from the trench bottom up to the springline of the pipe. Place embedment materials by methods that will not disturb or damage the pipe. Continue initial embedment of the pipe to at least six inches above the pipe crown or to the dimensions shown on the bedding detail. Use no stone larger than three-fourths-inch maximum dimension in the embedment. Compact the initial backfill and embedment firmly and evenly, but without use of mechanical compactors.
(3)
Remaining or final backfill. Unless otherwise specified or shown on the drawings, use excavated native material suitable for backfill for the final, or general backfilling. If sufficient suitable native material suitable for general backfill is not available on site, furnish sufficient and suitable borrow material from an approved source. Place backfill from top of initial backfill up to the trench surface as described herein. Do not place rocks larger than 12 inches in maximum dimension in the upper layer of backfill unless otherwise approved by the city.
a.
Trenches in streets, pavements, driveways (paved or unpaved), in areas to be paved, and in areas beneath proposed structures. Backfill above the initial backfill with crusher run stone. Place the stone backfill to achieve six-inch compacted layers at 95 percent standard proctor density. Use mechanical tamping to achieve the required compaction. In paved roadways also install and compact the specified pavement base material to the required thickness as shown on the pavement replacement detail. Install a temporary traffic surface at grade consisting of two inches compacted depth of crushed stone or pug mix. Leave backfilled trench open to traffic and maintain the surface at a uniform grade by refilling with stone and re-compacting as necessary to remedy any settlement. Continue such maintenance, including dust control, until surface paving is authorized by the city.
b.
Trenches in drainage ditches or other areas subject to erosion. Unless otherwise specified, backfill trenches with native material suitable for backfill and mechanically compact in six-inch layers to achieve 95 percent standard proctor density per ASTM D698. Refill and re-compact eroded or settled trenches as often as necessary to restore and maintain the surface at the required finished grade. Immediately stabilize the surface against erosion.
c.
Trenches in areas to be grassed or landscaped. Unless otherwise specified, backfill trenches with native material suitable for backfill and compact by methods of the contractor's choice to achieve at least 85 percent standard proctor density per ASTM D698. However, if the trench is on DOT or railroad rights-of-way, compact to the density specified in the applicable permit. Refill and re-compact settled trenches as often as necessary to restore and maintain the trench surface at the required finished grade.
(e)
Field quality control. The following steps are included in field quality control:
(1)
Perform routine quality control compaction testing at a frequency sufficient to ensure adequate compaction throughout the trenching and backfilling.
(2)
In streets, paved areas, or areas to be paved, perform compaction testing of the underlying backfill prior to placing pavement base material.
(3)
Notify the testing laboratory and the city 24 hours prior to need for testing.
(4)
When any tests indicate the density, moisture content, or compaction does not meet requirements specified herein, as determined by the city, rework until the required density has been obtained and approved by the city.

Water main separation. Use special precautions to maintain minimum separation distances between sewer and any existing or proposed water main.
a.
Where practical, maintain a minimum vertical separation of 18 inches between the outside of any water main and the outside of the sewer. Arrange the crossing so that the sewer joints will be equidistant and as far as possible from the water main joints. Where a sewer pipe must cross a water main, provide adequate structural support and protection for the water main to prevent damage.
b.
To the maximum extent practical, maintain at least ten feet of horizontal separation between the sewer and any existing or proposed water main. Under no circumstances shall the sewer and a water main be laid in the same trench.
c.
Where proposed sewer unavoidably conflicts with an existing water main, relocate the water main to maintain at least 18 inches of vertical separation under or over the sewer. Reconstruct the conflicting water main with ductile iron pipe or copper pipe, 18 feet minimum length, centered at the sewer. Coordinate all water main relocation with the water system's owner and perform all water main reconstruction in strict conformance with water system requirements.
d.
Notify the city immediately upon encountering field conditions that do not allow at least 18-inch vertical and/or ten-foot horizontal separation between sewer and any existing or proposed water main. Where it is not possible to obtain at least 18-inch vertical separation, install an 18-foot length of DIP pressure pipe for the sewer centered on the water main, or, as an alternate, encase the sewer in concrete.
(5)

City personnel will visit the job site on a periodic basis and will make spot checks as they deem appropriate. The city shall have the right to review and inspect all construction and may reject any work that does not meet quality control standards. Cost for all testing shall be paid for by the developer.
(1)
Manholes and appurtenances. Manholes will be visually inspected to check for plugging of lift holes, use of connecting boots, use of joint material, leakage, proper invert construction, and proper setting of frame and cover.
a.
Provide 48-hours' notice prior to testing and conduct all tests in the presence of the city.
b.
Prior to backfilling, conduct a vacuum leakage test on each completed sanitary sewer manhole in accordance with ASTM C1244. Place a vacuum of ten-inch Hg on the manhole as measured by an approved vacuum gauge. Maximum allowable vacuum loss shall be one-inch Hg in 60 seconds for four-foot diameter manhole, 75 seconds for a five-foot diameter manhole, or 90 seconds for a six-foot diameter manhole.
c.
Hydrostatic test. Testing must be conducted by plugging all inlet and outlet sewers after completion of manhole construction. Fill sewer manhole with water to top rim of the frame and cover. After concrete has been thoroughly moistened, monitor water loss over a two-hour period. Maximum allowable loss shall be two inches of water at the rim.
d.
Manhole construction. Manholes will be visually inspected to check for plugging of lift holes, use of connecting boots, use of joint material, leakage, proper invert construction, proper setting of frame and cover.
e.
Manholes which fail any of the tests specified herein shall be repaired by a method approved in advance by the city, or replaced, and re-tested until acceptable results are obtained. Correct all visible leaks regardless of test results. Grouting repairs may, at the city's discretion, be allowed on the exterior walls of the manhole only.
(2)
Gravity sanitary sewers and laterals. All material and work shall be subject to inspection at any time. All inadequate, defective, or improper work or materials will be rejected and the contractor will be required to replace or reconstruct the work. Provide 48-hours' notice to tests and conduct all testing in presence of the city. Gravity flow pipelines which fail any of the tests specified herein shall be repaired by a method approved by the city, or replaced, and re-tested until acceptable.
a.
Lamping test. Before calling for inspection of the installed sewers, flush all sewers clean of all water, sand, dirt, debris, or other obstructions. After the sewers have been fully backfilled for at least 30 days, provide labor, supplies, and equipment for lamping the completed sewers. Lamp the sewers in presence of the city. Any section of sewer which does not exhibit a smooth, straight, full-moon bore will be rejected.
b.
Deflection test for PVC pipe. Conduct deflection tests on all PVC sewers after the sewers have been fully backfilled for at least 30 days (or longer if, in the opinion of the city, soil moisture conditions have not allowed full backfill settlement). The deflection test shall consist of free passage of a properly sized solid mandrel or solid sewer ball sized to allow deflection no greater than five percent of the pipe actual interior diameter. Push or pull the mandrel or sewer ball by an approved method in the presence of the city. Any section of sewer which exhibits deflection exceeding five percent of the interior diameter will be rejected.
c.
Test for watertightness of gravity flow pipelines. Conduct test for watertightness of gravity flow pipelines in the presence of the city by one of the following methods at the city's discretion:
1.
Infiltration testing. Perform infiltration tests on all sewers in accordance with procedures set forth in ASTM C969. Measure infiltration flow with a calibrated V-notch weir for a minimum of four hours. The length of sewer tested shall not exceed 700 feet. For infiltration testing, the pipeline shall not leak in excess of a rate of 25 gallons per inch of diameter per mile of pipe line per day.
2.
Exfiltration testing. If, in the opinion of the city, groundwater levels will not provide sufficient hydrostatic water pressure to warrant infiltration testing, perform exfiltration testing in accordance with procedures set forth in ASTM C969. Fill the pipeline and manholes with water so that a head of at least two feet is provided above the top of the pipe at the uppermost end. Allow line to stand until the pipe has reached its maximum absorption, but not less than four hours. Refill line as required to re-establish minimum hydrostatic head and measure exfiltration rate over a four-hour period. For exfiltration testing, the pipeline shall not leak in excess of a rate of 25 gallons per inch of diameter per mile of pipeline per day.
3.
Air testing. Perform low pressure air testing for PVC sewers in accordance with ASTM F1417 for each section of sewer line. Temporarily plug and adequately brace all pipes prior to testing. Temporary restraints are also required for cleanouts and plugs for testing. Provide backfill sufficiently completed to prevent movement of the pipeline under air testing pressure. Allowable leakage will be based on an allowable loss as provided in Table 1 of ASTM F1417, using an initial pressure of 4.0 psi and maintaining a minimum of 3.5 psi. Observe all reasonable safety precautions during air testing, at a minimum, those precautions specified by ASTM F1417.
d.
Video inspection. Inspect each section of sewer by videoing from manhole to manhole. Any section of sewer which does not exhibit a smooth, straight, full-moon bore will be rejected. Videoing equipment must also possess a swivel head that has the capability of looking at each lateral connection. A copy of the video inspection must be provided to the city on an acceptable media format.
(3)
Other; compaction of backfill. Compaction testing may be required for sewers constructed in paved areas or where pavement is planned. A minimum of two tests per 500 feet of trench line located in roadways will be required. If any of these tests show failing results, then the failing backfill will be removed, re-compacted and re-tested, and one additional area will be tested as well.
