All applications for water or wastewater service that requires the extension of a water or wastewater main will be evaluated by the director of utilities department to determine the estimated cost of the proposed extension for submittal to the governing authority for approval. Based upon the availability of funds, the governing authority may approve or disapprove any application for water or wastewater service requiring a water main extension. Consistent with the terms and provisions of the interlocal agreement for the cooperative provision of water and wastewater services, as amended from time to time, entered into between the City of Tifton and Tift County, water and wastewater extensions fall into one of four categories known as "capital extensions," "economic extensions," "system improvements" and "basic extensions." The city manager and county manager and their staffs shall cooperate in developing and implementing "basic extensions" and "system improvements" using the strategic plan adopted by the city council of the City of Tifton and the board of commissioners of Tift County as a general guide; but both the city council and the county board of commissioners must approve any revisions or modifications to the strategic plan as well as any "capital extension" or "economic extension." The terms set forth hereinabove related to extensions are hereby defined as follows:
Basic water extension: Basic water or wastewater (i.e., sewer) extension is a customer requested extension, normally 1,000 feet or less, which accommodates an immediate development of a specific project. This extension is paid for by the customer, the developer or other external sources, but shall not be amortized into basic rates.
Capital extension: Capital extension is a programmed/planned extension that is part of a long range capital improvement program for the water and/or wastewater system. The improvements to be constructed are to improve overall operation, enlarge customer base and service area, aid in economic development, and provide fire protection. These projects can be funded through SPLOST, capital revenues, and/or loans/grants.
Economic extension: Economic extension is an extension to accommodate a proposed industrial, commercial, or residential customer. These extensions can be funded through capital revenues, SPLOST, loans/grants, and/or a private developer or individual.
System improvement: System improvement is an extension or improvement that is part of the current budget year. The project may be an extension or replacement of an existing water or wastewater (i.e., sewer) main within the service area. The work is to improve overall quality, eliminate maintenance problems, or improve reliability of the water system. These improvements are to be paid for out of budget funds.
(b)
All costs of easements, jacking and/or boring, fire hydrants or other related costs which may be required for the water or wastewater main extension are the responsibility of the applicant. The governing authority shall have no obligation or responsibility for the costs of any on-site facilities either inside or outside the corporate limits.
(c)
All water main extensions shall include the installation of fire hydrants at a distance of not more than 600 feet apart unless otherwise approved by the fire official. The cost of the hydrants and related appurtenances shall be paid in accordance with the provisions herein and any applicable resolutions of the governing authority relating thereto.
(d)
All water main extensions with hydrants attached or wastewater main extensions shall be of a minimum of eight inches. The governing authority may, in its discretion, require the installation of water or wastewater mains larger than eight inches, in which case the governing authority will be responsible for the additional costs directly resulting from the oversizing.
(e)
Prior to any application being approved and the work authorized, the applicant shall pay all estimated costs required under the provisions of these regulations. Any difference between the actual and estimated costs of the extension, either upward or downward, shall be reconciled as necessary upon completion of the project.
(f)
In the event that a water or wastewater main extension makes service available to other property owners abutting said extension, such other property owners shall be required to pay to the governing authority their proportionate share, if any, of the costs of the extension borne by the original applicant on a front foot basis before being permitted to connect to said extension. The charges collected will be refunded by the governing authority to the original applicant, but in no case will the refunds exceed the amount paid by the original applicant. Any refunds due to the original applicant will be paid, without interest, on March 31 and September 30, as appropriate.
(g)
All liability for payment of refunds by the governing authority shall cease three years from the date of payment by the applicant for water or wastewater main extension. The assignment by the applicant of any money due under the provisions of this refund policy without the written consent of the governing authority is prohibited.
(h)
In the event that a water or wastewater main is extended, either inside or outside the corporate limits, the costs of which is paid in part or in full by the governing authority, applicants who wish to connect to the main shall be required to pay a connection charge in addition to the meter installation fee as referenced in section 110-143. The connection charge shall be applicant's proportionate share, on a footage basis, of the governing authority's share of the cost of the extension. If the water or wastewater main installed is larger than eight-inch, the applicant shall be required to pay only its proportionate share of the cost of an eight-inch main.
(i)
All water and wastewater mains extended under the provisions of these regulations shall become the sole property of the governing authority upon the connection with the city-county water system and shall thenceforth be maintained by the city-county governing authority.
(j)
Anything in these regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, the governing authority in its sole discretion, shall have the right to disapprove any application for water service when it determines that it is not in its best interest to do so based on monetary or manpower constraints or on other considerations such as the unavailability of water or wastewater supply. Furthermore, the governing authority reserves the right to extend its water system on a planned basis in the best interest of orderly community-wide growth.
