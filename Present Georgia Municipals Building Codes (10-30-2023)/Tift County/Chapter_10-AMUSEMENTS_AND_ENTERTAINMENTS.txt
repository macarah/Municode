ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 10-1—10-25. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 10-26. - Findings and public purpose of article.
The board of commissioners finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to enact regulations to reduce the possible adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. However, the board of commissioners also finds that the outright prohibition of such establishments could improperly infringe upon protected forms of expression. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to reasonably regulate adult entertainment establishments in a manner that serves the legitimate governmental interest of reducing criminal activity and protecting property values without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and their patrons.

Further, the activities and uses which are regulated and permitted by this article shall only be allowed if they are not obscene and not in violation of any other such prohibitions on nudity or sexual activity.
