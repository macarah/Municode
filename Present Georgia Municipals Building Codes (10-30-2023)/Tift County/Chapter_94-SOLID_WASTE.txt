(1)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it in to full compliance with the applicable codes, relevant to the cited violation and if applicable, to secure the structure so it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or

The court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination.

Any such sale of salvage materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid.

The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior and shall continue in force until paid. Upon filing such certified copy of the magistrate court's order with the clerk of county superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of cost to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. title 48, chapter 4; providing, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the county board of commissioners. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. The board of commissioners may waive and release any such lien imposed upon property upon the owner of such property entering a contract with the county agreeing to a time table for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
Any order for the correction of violations entered by the county magistrate court shall be subject to review by direct appeal to the county superior court pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.
