Sec. 2-144. - Policy for an economic development loan fund.
There is hereby established a policy for the administration of the economic development revolving loan fund of the city, to be applicable to the downtown area or coextensive with the boundary of the downtown development authority area of the city.
(1)
Source of funds. The economic development loan fund shall consist of federal grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development of the United States of America, program or miscellaneous income, and such other funds as may be available therefor.
(2)
Object of benefit. Loan funds shall be used primarily to benefit the city's low-income and moderate-income population through economic development of the central business district within the downtown development authority boundaries.
(3)
Security. Security for the repayment of all loan funds shall consist of a first or second security interest in the borrower's assets (whether real or personal property) being financed by such loan proceeds, or a security interest in whatever assets of the borrower that the city council may require in order to fully secure the economic development loan. Loans to a corporation shall be personally guaranteed by the shareholders of the corporation. If the borrower is not the owner of the real property to be improved with said loan funds, then, unless otherwise authorized by the city council, the owner of said real property shall guarantee repayment of said loan to the city and shall secure such guarantee by execution and delivery of a deed to secure debt with respect to such real property to the city.
(4)
Annual interest rate. The interest rate shall be four percent per annum or such other interest rates that may be adopted in the future.
(5)
Maximum loan amount. The maximum loan amount shall be $25,000.00; provided, however, under special circumstances whereby the city council in its sole discretion deems a larger loan is necessary to expedite the downtown development authority program in a timely manner or to bring an individual loan proposal package to completion, said maximum loan amount may be exceeded by the city council. The maximum loan amount shall not exceed 80 percent of the cost of the improvements financed by the loan.
(6)
Use of loan funds. The use of loan funds shall be limited to:
a.
Facade improvements, including signage. Historic preservation commission approval shall be obtained where required by ordinance.
b.
Interior or exterior structural improvements, including roof, heating/air, plumbing and electrical systems or improvements thereto. Such systems and improvements shall become fixtures and remain with the property.
c.
Provision of financial assistance by way of a loan for start-up operating costs and working capital. Start-up operating costs and working capital shall be limited to $10,000.00. The applicant shall provide all documentary information regarding the ownership of collateral and the market value of the collateral to be used as collateral in connection with the loan for start-up operating costs and working capital. The city shall be authorized to require an appraisal of such proposed collateral at the expense of the applicant, and the city shall be authorized to reject such loan application should such appraisal, if conducted, show that the proposed collateral is of insufficient value, as determined in the sole discretion of the city council, to properly collateralize the proposed loan.
(7)
Length of loan. No loan may be amortized or repaid over more than ten years.
(8)
Availability of loans. Loans shall only be made as funds are available to the city council from the economic development loan fund for such loans.
(9)
Priority.
a.
The priority for loan funds is the financing of projects that show job creation or job retention, especially jobs which employ low-income and moderate-income persons. In addition, for economic redevelopment activities, a commitment must be made by the recipient of the loan that 51 percent of the jobs created or retained by the economic development activities financed by the loan shall be reserved for low-income and moderate-income persons.
b.
An equal priority for loan funds is the financing of projects that will benefit low-income and moderate-income persons. Such benefits shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, the financing of a project to construct or renovate a structure to be used for job training for low-income and moderate-income persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall be sufficient if the recipient of the loan makes a written commitment to the city, where such written commitment is not prohibited by law, that of the persons benefited by the project, at least 51 percent of them will be low-income and moderate-income persons.
c.
For the purposes of this section, the terms "low-income persons" and "moderate-income persons" shall be defined the same as they are periodically defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
(10)
Selection of projects. The loan review committee shall act as agent for the city in determining the selection of projects to be financed. The city council shall have final approval of all such loans and all agreements made in connection therewith.
(11)
Responsibility and authority over final selection. None of the policies stated herein shall be construed to restrict the city council from having full responsibility and authority over the final project selection to be financed by the downtown development authority revolving loan fund.
(12)
Repayment. Each loan made shall provide for the repayment of all principal and interest according to the amortization schedule approved by the city council, as well as for the payment of collection costs, attorney's fees, court costs and penalties for late payment in such amounts as may be agreed upon by the parties.
(13)
Nonrefundable handling fee. Each completed loan application that is submitted for consideration must be accompanied by a nonrefundable handling fee in the amount established by ordinance that will cover the cost of credit checks, copies, postage, and other such costs that are incurred during the application process.

(f)
All loans from the revolving loan fund shall be approved by the city council, and no proposed loan shall be presented to the city council for such approval unless such proposal has been reviewed and approved by the staff of the city department of community and economic development under procedures authorized in the resolution establishing the policies, terms, and conditions pursuant to which such loans may be granted.
