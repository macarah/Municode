Applications involving demolition or relocation shall be accompanied by post-demolition or relocation plans for the site.
(e)
Acceptable commission reaction to applications.
(1)
The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material changes in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or landmark or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture and material of the architectural features involved, and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style, and pertinent features of the other structures in the immediate neighborhood.

Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission.

(j)
Necessary actions to be taken by commission upon rejection.
(1)
In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternate courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if the applicant so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
(2)
In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building official or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such cases, no building permit shall be issued.
(k)
Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property or landmark, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to said provisions, or to interpret the meaning of said provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done.

(3)
After issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, changes in the work or changes to approve a plan must be submitted to and approved by the commission prior to beginning work on any aspect of such changes. Any such amendment or modification to the original plan must be submitted to the commission and approved by the commission in the same manner as an original certificate of appropriateness application is considered.

Certificate to become void if construction not commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six months of date of issuance.
