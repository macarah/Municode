Sec. 94-162. - PMUD (planned mixed-use district).
(a)
Purposes of the planned mixed-use district.
(1)
The purpose of this district is to provide for appropriate planned development of quality mixed-use projects within the City of Americus by allowing greater freedom of design, by improving the opportunity for flexibility and creativity in the land development process, by undertaking techniques which foster community and pedestrianism, and by limiting the expenditure of public funds in an effort to achieve the objectives and intent of the city's comprehensive plan. Specifically, this district is intended to:
a.
Allow diversification of uses, structures, densities and open spaces when not in conflict with existing and permitted land uses on abutting properties;
b.
Reduce development costs through a more efficient use of land and a smaller network of utilities and streets than is possible through the application of standards contained in conventional land development regulations;
c.
Conserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging the preservation of environmentally significant, scenic and functional open space;
d.
Provide maximum opportunity for the application of innovative site planning concepts through the creation of aesthetically pleasing environments for living, shopping and working on properties of adequate size, shape and location;
e.
Insure that development will occur according to the advantages and limitations of land, site design, population density, building coverage, improvement standards and construction phasing as authorized through the approval of a comprehensive site development plan;
f.
Provide a mechanism to incorporate and implement the goals and intent of the City of Americus Comprehensive Plan; and
g.
Encourage pedestrianism and transportation alternatives.
(2)
This district is not intended to increase overall density or development intensity on a particular property except in relation to an improved design and benefit to the public. The use of open space, public meeting areas and recreational uses should be included as part of any project. This district is intended to provide a vehicle for improved development through creative design and appropriate mixtures of land uses.
(3)
There are two variations of the planned mixed-use district: Mixed-use village and mixed-use center. The city's comprehensive plan should be consulted to determine when and where each of these variations may be appropriate.
(b)
Minimum design requirements.
(1)
Consistency with comprehensive plan. All projects must be reasonably consistent with the goals and intents of the City of Americus Comprehensive Plan.
(2)
Variations to development standards.
a.
Variations to local development standards (i.e. development and zoning regulations), including variations in lot sizes, widths, building setbacks, densities, parking requirements, right-of-way widths, street widths, buffers and other components may be approved to improve said project. Any variation to an adopted regulation or requirement must be expressly submitted and reviewed as part of an overall plan. All variations must be included in a "list of standards" agreed to and accepted by the city.
b.
The city will not consider variations to standards or regulations of other regulating jurisdictions, such as erosion control regulations, fire codes, floodplain control, stream buffers or other similar regulations, without the express written consent and approval of applicable jurisdiction. Furthermore, said consent shall not guarantee, nor require the city to waive any or all requirements.
(3)
Design requirements. All projects should incorporate traditional neighborhood design principles. Interconnectivity, pedestrianism, good design, architectural detail and appropriate scale are essential elements. Where appropriate, separate land uses are encouraged to be integrated both horizontally and vertically.
(4)
At a minimum all projects shall include and/or incorporate the following components:
a.
All planned mixed-use development projects must have a minimum of two distinct type of land use (commercial and single-family, industrial and multifamily, etc.).
b.
All projects must have a professionally prepared master plan for the entire project. It must be designed and incorporated together to provide a harmonious transition from one use to another. Common architecture, themes, significant natural features, connectivity and other items must be included.
c.
A functional town center, community green, park, or other focal point must be included to create character and identity.
d.
Interconnections to adjoining property, whether developed or undeveloped, should be included and incorporated into the design where appropriate.
e.
All projects should have adequate and appropriate access.
f.
Other standards, as outlined in the City of Americus Comprehensive Plan Design Guidelines, which are appropriate for the site's specific location and character area should be included.
(5)
When determining the appropriateness and viability of a proposed project, the city shall consult the City of Americus Comprehensive Plan. Projects that prove that the use of innovative or creative design will benefit the city may be considered for said district.
(c)
Permitted uses.
(1)
Planned mixed-use village.
a.
Planned mixed-use villages shall be primarily residential in character and may include a mixture of single-family and multifamily residential uses. Overall residential density shall be limited to no more than _____ units per acre. Lower densities may be required by the city where appropriate.
b.
Supplemental nonresidential uses (office and limited retail) are permitted when complimentary to and compatible with the orderly operation of the residential project, provided that all such uses shall not constitute more than 20 percent of the total project land area or gross floor area, whichever is less, or as otherwise permitted by the city council. Residential uses may be attached, semi-attached, detached and/or located within multi-story buildings above nonresidential office or commercial development.
c.
Mixed-use villages shall be designed using the adopted Comprehensive Plan Design Guidelines adopted by the City of Americus. Favorable projects will incorporate most, if not all, of these standards.
d.
All projects shall incorporate good design and engineering principles.
(2)

Sec. 94-166. - Background.
Whereas, there is presently no provision in the City of Americus Code of Ordinances providing for the existence of an arts and cultural district overlay; and
Whereas, the mayor and city council of the city (the "governing body") deems it appropriate to establish an arts and cultural district overlay and promote art and culture in the city and the surrounding area by the facilitation of an environment within the city which positively influences and enhances the lives of citizens of the city and visitors to the city, as well as enhancing and improving the city's economy; and
Whereas, the governing body of the city has determined that it would be advantageous and appropriate to establish an arts and cultural district overlay within the corporate limits of the city in order to facilitate a location where the expression of artistic and cultural diversity may be displayed, acted upon, and enjoyed by citizens and visitors of the city and surrounding areas; and
Whereas, the governing body of the city has further determined that the establishment of an arts and cultural district overlay as part of the city's zoning code is in the best interests of the city and its citizens.
(Ord. No. O-2021-7, 7-22-2021)
Sec. 94-167. - Arts and cultural district overlay—Purposes and establishment.
The governing body of the city recognizes that human creativity is critical to the city's future economic success. Arts and culture-related businesses and organizations add cultural and economic diversity to the city, enhance the lives of the city's residents and visitors to the city, and positively impact the city's economy by generating jobs and revenue and by retaining a competitive workforce. Thus, in the considered opinion of the governing body, it is important to encourage co-location of arts and culture-related businesses and organizations within a defined arts and cultural district overlay within the city, thereby enhancing those businesses and organizations to more effectively promote their common interests. The governing body of the city has further determined that the location of arts and culture-related businesses and organizations within the city will encourage the growth of creative industries and complementary businesses, as well as serve as a source of prideful experience for students of Georgia Southwestern State University, South Georgia Technical College, and local school systems, thus increasing the overall economic activity within the district and neighboring areas. Based upon the foregoing, the governing body of the city deems it appropriate to establish an arts and cultural district overlay within the corporate limits of the city in accord with the provisions of sections 94-166 through 94-179.

Sec. 94-170. - Purpose of district.
The purpose of the district overlay is to facilitate creation of an arts destination, sustain established ruts and culture uses, and promote new arts and culture uses.
