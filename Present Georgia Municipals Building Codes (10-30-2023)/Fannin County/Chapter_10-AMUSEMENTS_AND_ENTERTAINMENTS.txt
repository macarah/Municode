Chapter 10 - AMUSEMENTS AND ENTERTAINMENTS
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 10-1—10-20. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 10-21. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot defacto approach prohibition. Otherwise a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: Reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
