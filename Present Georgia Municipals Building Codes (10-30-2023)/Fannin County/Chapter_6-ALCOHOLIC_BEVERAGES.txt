(b)
No license shall issue for a location within an area where, in the judgment and discretion of the county commission, the number of malt beverage or wine licenses already granted makes it contrary to the public interest or welfare.

No license shall issue for a location at which the operation of such a licensed business would violate regulations of the county.
(d)
No license shall issue for a location where a previous license has been revoked or suspended, and where, in the judgment of the county commission, the problems which have arisen from the operation of a licensed business at such a location indicate that it is not in the interests of public health, safety, welfare, or morals that the sale of malt beverages or wines be permitted at such a location.

No license shall issue for a location where it would violate state or local law, regulations or resolutions.
(f)
No license shall issue for a location where the main entrance of the main structure of the business is located within 500 feet of the main entrance of the main structure of any school or church as measured in a straight line between the two structures. The word "school" shall include kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, day cares licensed for more than 20 students, colleges and other educational institutions whether public or private; provided, however, this provision shall not apply where it would prohibit the renewal of an alcoholic beverage license for the sale of malt beverages and wine at a location where a license holder had been granted a license under the terms of any prior county resolution relating to the sale of malt beverages and wines. In the event a school or church subsequently locates within 500 feet of licensed premises, this provision shall not be applicable under such circumstances and such an event would not cause a license holder to be in violation of this provision or prohibit the renewal of a license. In such cases, the license may be renewed by the same license holder for the same place of business as long as all of the other provisions of this chapter are complied with. No license shall issue for any location in which the licensed premises contain a drive-in window for the sale of malt beverages and wine.
