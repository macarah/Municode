Chapter 54 - SIGNS
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 54-1. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
The board of commissioners of Fannin County, a political subdivision of the State of Georgia, is enacting this chapter to insure that noncommercial messages are authorized with restriction only as to the size of such signage and to establish reasonable regulations for signage containing commercial messages.
(b)
The board of commissioners of Fannin County, a political subdivision of the State of Georgia, finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard, a detriment to property values, and adversely effect the natural beauty of the Fannin County, Georgia, area and thereby negatively impact on the travel and tourism industry of Fannin County, Georgia, which is the largest industry in Fannin County, Georgia, and can adversely impact the overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance.
(c)
By enacting this chapter, the members of the board of commissioners of Fannin County, Georgia, intend to:
(1)
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
Protect the public health, safety, and welfare;
(3)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(4)
Maintain the aesthetic beauty of the county;
(5)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(6)
Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(7)
Promote economic development; and
(8)
Insure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
