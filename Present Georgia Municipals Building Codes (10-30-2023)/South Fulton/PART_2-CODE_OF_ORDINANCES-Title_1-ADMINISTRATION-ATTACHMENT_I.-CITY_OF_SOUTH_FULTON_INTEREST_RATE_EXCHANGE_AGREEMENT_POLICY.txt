ATTACHMENT I. - CITY OF SOUTH FULTON INTEREST RATE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT POLICY
This policy will govern the use by City of South Fulton (the "city") of Interest Rate Exchange Agreements. "Interest Rate Exchange Agreement" shall mean a written contract entered into in connection with the issuance of city debt or in connection with city debt already outstanding with a counterparty to provide for an exchange of payments based upon fixed and/or variable interest rates. The failure by the city to comply with any provision of this policy will not invalidate or impair any Interest Rate Exchange Agreement.
The Conditions under Which Interest Rate Exchange Agreements
May Be Entered Into
Purposes. Interest Rate Exchange Agreements may be used for the following purposes only to:
(1)
Achieve significant savings as compared to a product available in the bond market if the use of derivatives helps to achieve diversification of a particular bond offering;
(2)
Enhance investment returns within prudent risk guidelines;
(3)
Prudently hedge risk in the context of a particular financing or the overall asset/liability management of the city;
(4)
Incur variable rate exposure within prudent guidelines;
(5)
Achieve more flexibility in meeting overall financial objectives than available in conventional markets; and
(6)
Accomplish a financial objective not otherwise obtainable using traditional financing methods.
Legality. The city must receive an opinion acceptable to the market from a nationally recognized law firm that the Interest Rate Exchange Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the city and entering into the transaction complies with applicable law.
Speculation. Interest Rate Exchange Agreements shall not be used for speculative purposes. Associated risks will be prudent risks that are appropriate for the city to take.
Methods by Which Such Contracts Shall be Solicited and Procured
In general, the city should procure Interest Rate Exchange Agreements by competitive bidding. The city shall determine which parties it will allow to participate in a competitive transaction. The city has the right to accept matching bids to diversify counterparty risk or reward firms for ideas and work performed. The parameters for the bid must be disclosed in writing to all potential bidders.
Notwithstanding the above, the city may procure Interest Rate Exchange Agreements by negotiated methods when the city makes a determination that, due to the size or complexity of a particular swap, a negotiated transaction would result in the most favorable pricing and terms or innovation.
To facilitate the procurement of Interest Rate Exchange Agreements, the city will engage an independent financial advisory firm to assist in the price negotiations, in the development of terms and in risk assessment. The city shall obtain an independent opinion that the terms and conditions of the Interest Rate Exchange Agreement reflect a fair market value of such agreement as of the date of its execution.
Form and Content of Interest Rate Exchange Agreements
To the extent possible, the Interest Rate Exchange Agreements entered into by the city shall contain the terms and conditions set forth in the International Swap and Derivatives Association, Inc. ("ISDA") Master Agreement, including any schedules and confirmation. The schedule should be modified to reflect specific legal requirements and business terms desired by the city.
The city shall consider including provisions that permit the city to assign its rights and obligations under the Interest Rate Exchange Agreement and to optionally terminate the agreement at its market value at any time. In general, the counterparty shall not have the right to optionally terminate an agreement.
Events of default. Events of default of a counterparty shall include the following:
(1)
Failure to make payments when due;
(2)
Material breach of representations and warranties;
(3)
Illegality;
(4)
Failure to comply with downgrade provisions; and/or
(5)
Failure to comply with any other provisions of the agreement after a specified notice period.
The city will have the right to terminate the agreement upon an event of default by the counterparty. Upon such termination, the counterparty will be the "defaulting party" for purposes of calculating the termination payment owed.
Aspects of Risk Exposure Associated with Such Contracts
Before entering into an Interest Rate Exchange Agreement, the city shall evaluate all the risks inherent in the transaction. These risks to be evaluated could include:
(1)
Counterparty risk — the risk of a payment default on a swap by an issuer's counterparty;
(2)
Termination risk — the risk that a swap has a negative value and the issuer owes a breakage fee if the contract has to be terminated;
(3)
Rollover risk — the risk of a failed remarketing or auction with respect to any variable rate bonds associated with a swap; or the risk that an issuer cannot secure a cost-effective renewal of a letter or line of credit;
(4)
Basis risk — the risk that floating rate cash flow streams may diverge from each other;
(5)
Tax event risk — the risk that the spread between taxable and tax-exempt rates will change as a result of changes in income tax laws or other conditions; and
(6)
Amortization risk — the risk that the amortization of the swap will not be fully integrated with the amortization of the underlying bonds.
The city shall endeavor to diversify its exposure to counterparties. To that end, before entering into a transaction, it should determine its exposure to the relevant counterparty or counterparties and determine how the proposed transaction would affect the exposure. The exposure should not be measured solely in terms of notional amount, but also how changes in interest rates would affect the city's "Value at Risk" exposure for outstanding agreements.
Counterparty Selection Criteria
The city may enter into an Interest Rate Exchange Agreement if the counterparty has at least two long-term unsecured credit ratings in the double A category from Fitch, Moody's, or S&P and the counterparty has demonstrated experience in successfully executing Interest Rate Exchange Agreements. If after entering into an agreement the ratings of the counterparty are downgraded below the ratings required, then the agreement shall be subject to termination unless:
(1)
The counterparty provides either a substitute guarantor or assigns the agreement, in either case, to a party meeting the rating criteria reasonably acceptable to the city or
(2)
The counterparty (or guarantor) collateralizes the Interest Rate Exchange Agreement in accordance with the criteria set forth in this Policy and the Interest Rate Exchange Agreement.
Provisions for Collateralization
Should the rating of the counterparty, or if secured, the entity unconditionally guaranteeing its payment obligations not satisfy the requirements of the Counterparty Selection Criteria, then the obligations of the counterparty shall be fully and continuously collateralized by:
(1)
Direct obligations of, or obligations the principal and interest on which are guaranteed by, the United States of America; or
(2)
Direct obligations of U.S. Agencies and such collateral shall be deposited with the city or an agent thereof. The specific collateral requirements for each Interest Rate Agreement shall be set forth in the corresponding swap documentation.
Long-Term Implications
In evaluating a transaction involving the use of Interest Rate Exchange Agreements, the city shall review long-term implications associated with entering into Interest Rate Exchange Agreements, including costs of borrowing, historical interest rate trends, variable rate capacity, credit enhancement capacity, opportunities to refund related debt obligations and other similar considerations.
Methods to be Used to Reflect Such Contracts in the City's Financial Statements
The city shall reflect the use of Interest Rate Exchange Agreements on its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Monitoring
The city shall monitor the performance of Interest Rate Exchange Agreements and may employ a financial advisor to assist in evaluating the effectiveness of its Agreements. A written report, provided at a minimum quarterly, shall include at least:
(1)
Preparing a description of each contract, including a summary of its terms and conditions, the notional amount, rates, maturity and other provisions thereof;
(2)
Determining any amounts which were required to be paid and received, and that the amounts were paid and received;
(3)
Determining that each counterparty is in compliance with its rating requirements;
(4)
Determining that each counterparty is in compliance with the downgrade provisions, if applicable (See Counterparty Selection Criteria);
(5)
Assessing the counterparty risk, termination risk, basis risk and other risks, which shall include the marked to market value for each counterparty and relative exposure compared to other counterparties and a calculation of the city's Value at Risk for each counterparty; and
(6)
Determining, at least quarterly, that all posted collateral, if required, has a net market value of at least the collateral in the Interest Rate Agreement.
