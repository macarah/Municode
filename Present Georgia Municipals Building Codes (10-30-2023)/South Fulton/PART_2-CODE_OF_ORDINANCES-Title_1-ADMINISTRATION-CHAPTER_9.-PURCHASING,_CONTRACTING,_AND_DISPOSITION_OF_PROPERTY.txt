(1)
Sole source/single source procurement. The city may acquire goods, services, or professional services pursuant to a sole source/single source procurement. Sole source/single source procurement is allowable when goods, services, or professional services are limited to one source, or when they must be obtained from a specific manufacturers' dealer and valid competition among dealers does not exist. A sole source/single source procurement may also be made from one person among others in a competitive market place, which, for justifiable reasons, is found to be most advantageous for the purpose of fulfilling the given purchasing need.
(2)
Sole brand procurement. The purchasing agent may elect to purchase particular brand name goods or services when the goods or services comprise a major brand system, program or service previously selected by the city for standardization due to operational effectiveness, future enhancements or additions, or maintenance or storage of spare parts precludes the mixing of brands, manufacture, etc. The user must submit the justification for the sole source/single source procurement for approval to the purchasing agent.
(3)
Direct negotiation following competitive solicitation. Following the completion of a competitive award solicitation process that fails to produce a responsible or responsive bidder or proposer, fails to produce a qualified respondent, or for which all submissions were rejected for any reason, the city may procure the goods, services, or professional services that were the subject of such failed solicitation by direct negotiation with any provider of such failed solicitation. Direct negotiations shall be facilitated by the purchasing manager, with assistance as necessary by the city manager and city attorney. A proposed contract shall be submitted to the city council for consideration. The council may reject, approve or direct further negotiations of the contract. Direct negotiations under this paragraph shall commence within 90 days of the completion of the failed competitive solicitation process.
(4)
Emergency procurement.
a.
Under defined thresholds. The city and city manager may acquire goods, services or professional services under the defined thresholds by direct negotiation, in lieu of the formal solicitation processes set forth under this chapter, in situations of an emergency. Emergency situations exist where there is an imminent threat to: a) public health, safety or welfare, b) the soundness and integrity of public services or property, or c) the delivery of essential city services. Emergency procurements shall be made with as much competition as is reasonable or practicable under the circumstances, which may consist of acquisition of goods and services under the direct negotiation process outlined in the paragraph above. As soon as practicable, a record of each emergency procurement shall be made and shall set forth the contractor's name, the amount and type of the contract, a listing of the item procured under the contract, the basis for the emergency situation and the identification number of the contract file.
b.
Above defined thresholds. In the event the amount to be expended for an emergency exceeds $100,000.00, the city manager, at a special called council meeting, shall formally communicate the emergency expenditure in a detailed written report to the city council for approval. The report shall include:
1.
The basis for the emergency,
2.
The name of the selected and/or anticipated contractor,
3.
The amount and length of the contract,
4.
A copy of the proposed contract, where practicable,
5.
A listing of the item(s) to be procured, and
6.
The location within the budget where the funds are requested to be pulled.
c.
Emergency grants. Emergency procurements associated with projects utilizing grant funds will always follow the established procurement procedures of the grant.
(5)
Costs under the competitive threshold. The user department may acquire goods, services and professional services by direct negotiation or by some other non-competitive method, when the dollar value of the purchase does not exceed $2,501.00 and a properly executed and authorized requisition is received. Under this non-competitive method, the user department shall attempt to obtain the goods, services or professional services most advantageous to the city, price and other factors considered.
(6)
Direct negotiation and other public entities and co-ops. The city may acquire goods, services, and professional services by direct negotiation or other method involving limited or no competition from a supplier having a requirements contract/annual agreement with any public entity (e.g., federal, state, county, city, authority, school board, buying cooperative, etc.) for goods, services, or professional services described in such contract and at prices or discounts no less favorable than any set forth in such contracts. Use of state/co-op contracts: the purchasing agent may, independent of the requirements of bid process of this article, procure supplies, services or construction items through a contract established through competitive means by the purchasing department of the State of Georgia, national co-ops (i.e. U.S. communities), and collaborative purchasing agreements with other local governments when deemed to be in the best interest of the city.
Nothing in this chapter shall impact and/or limit the city's ability to pursue purchasing cooperatives and alternatives allowable under state law through the Georgia Municipal Association and other organizations.
(l)
Competitive procurements. The purchasing department will determine the procurement method to be used based on the type and estimated price of the purchase. The city reserves the right to reject any or all bids if it determines such rejection to be in the best interest of the city. Formal solicitations will generally be solicited on a project-by-project basis. The user will submit the scope of goods and/or services to the purchasing manager, who will then determine which of the competitive processes best suits the purchase. A performance guarantee, such as a performance bond or letter of credit, may be required for any solicitation that includes services to be performed after consultation with the city manager, and others, as necessary. Periodically, the city may be given private/public grants and donations from sources such as the state and federal government and private corporations. These types of solicitations may be more restrictive and may dictate the procurement process and methodology that the city is to follow for an award. Both federal and state procurement policy supersedes City of South Fulton's purchasing requirements when buying goods and services using federal or state grant monies. Departments should consult the accounting department regarding the use of federal and state funds.
(1)
Invitation to bids. Invitation to bids (ITB) are prepared and issued to prospective bidders, with the goal of obtaining competitive responses for items costing $25,001.00 and greater.
a.
Public notice (such as publication in a newspaper of general circulation, posting on the purchasing department's internet web page, posting on state internet web page, or third party eSourcing platform) of the ITB must be given a minimum of 14 calendar days prior to the date set for bid opening or as required by state and federal law, unless it can be demonstrated that an urgent requirement for goods or services exists, in which instance, the requirement for public notice may be reduced by the purchasing manager.
b.
Bids shall be opened publicly by the purchasing manager, or their designee, in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the ITB. All relevant information, including each bid amount and bidder's name, will be recorded on a summary sheet and signed by the opener and witness.
c.
The purchasing manager shall evaluate the bids and make a recommendation to the city council. A split or partial bid may be awarded if an ITB is for multiple goods or services, more than one vendor provides a bid that meets the specifications for the items, and a price comparison can be made between the items quoted. The award may be split between more than one vendor by awarding to the lowest cost provider of each item or reasonable grouping of items if acquisition, delivery, and other requirements can be reasonably administered. A split or partial bid award shall not be used under the following conditions:
1.
When the solicitation is for an integrated system and the split of the award between components or parts of that system would jeopardize performance; or
2.
If the item is part of a system and the performance of that system would be jeopardized if another brand was substituted.
d.
Tie bids: In the event two or more identical bids are received, the following procedure will be used when the basis of award is low bid:
1.
To the extent permitted by law, a tie bidder with a registered business location within the city will be recommended to the city council for an award over one without an office in the city, a registered business within the county limits of Fulton County should be recommended to the city council for an award over one without an office in the county, and a registered business within the State of Georgia will be recommended to the city council for an award over one without an office in Georgia.
2.
If the procedures in the paragraph above do not result in an award, then, the tie bidders will be contacted and advised of the tie bid. Bidders will be given the opportunity to provide a best and final offer in writing submitted in a sealed envelope to be opened at the time and place stated by city staff. If one or more of the tied bidders agrees to participate, award will be made to the new low bid. If none of the tied bidders agree to participate or if the new bids are tied, then city staff shall break the tie by following the procedures described below, as necessary.
3.
If the procedures in (i) and (ii) do not result in an award, then, to the extent permitted by law, a tie bidder deemed in the city's sole discretion to provide the most environmentally preferable goods would be recommended to the appropriate approving authority for an award over one deemed environmentally inferior.
4.
In the event the above does not result in an award, the city reserves the right to award to both tie vendors when it is feasible and in the best interest of the city to do so.
5.
Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids is permitted in accordance to the terms indicated within the ITB; however, minor irregularities may be waived by the city. No bid may be withdrawn for a period of 120 days after the time scheduled for bid opening or as permissible by state law.
e.
Any bid received after the time and date set for receipt of bids is late. Any withdrawal or modification of a bid received after the time and date set for opening of bids, at the place designated for opening, is considered late. Late bids will be rejected and remain unopened.
f.
Bids will be evaluated based on the evaluation factors set forth in the ITB, which may include criteria to determine acceptability of goods (for example, inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose). Criteria for the acceptability of goods shall be used to determine whether particular goods are responsive to the invitation to bids, and not to determine the relative desirability between acceptable goods.
g.
The city reserves the right to waive any informalities or irregularities of bids, to request clarification of information submitted in any bid, to further negotiate with the responsive and responsible bidder selected for contract award, or to reject any or all bids for any reason whatsoever.
h.
If no responsive and responsible bids are received or all bids are rejected, the city may procure such goods and services by direct negotiation.
i.
The bid will be awarded, if an award is made, to the responsible and responsive bidder offering the lowest price whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the ITB. The bid may require a contract.
(2)
Request for informal quotes (RFIQ). Request for informal quotes are prepared and issued to prospective bidders by the user department, with the goal of obtaining competitive responses for items costing between $2,501.00 and $50,000.00. The RFIQ shall define the scope of the work and may contain contractual terms and conditions. In most cases, the bid award will be made on best price, but the award may be made on other grounds which are determined to be in the best interest of the city. The RFIQ may require the submission of bid samples, descriptive literature, and technical data and may require inspection or testing of a product before a final award. The user department shall summarize quotes on a summary sheet for use in consideration of an award.
(3)
Request for proposals (RFP). When the purchasing manager determines the use of an ITB is not practical or not advantageous because of existing market conditions or the type of items required, the city may procure goods, services, or professional services through receipt of competitive sealed proposals. Competitive sealed proposals are solicited using an RFP, with the goal of obtaining competitive responses for items costing more than $25,001.00.
a.
Public notice of the RFP shall be given in the same manner as for ITB procurements.
b.
Proposals shall be opened publicly by the purchasing manager, or their designee, in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the RFP. A register of proposals shall be prepared that lists each proposer's name, which will be signed by the opener and the witness.
c.
Correction or withdrawal of proposals is permitted in accordance with any instructions allowing the same contained within the RFP.
d.
Proposals shall be deemed late in the same manner as the procurement process for an ITB.
e.
The RFP will identify the criteria to be considered and evaluated as the basis of award.
f.
Proposals submitted by responsible and responsive proposers shall be evaluated in writing by the purchasing agents and purchasing manager based upon the criteria applicable to the RFP. All proposals will be ranked by such evaluators in order of their acceptability, giving consideration to the criteria. The city has no obligation to award the contract to the proposer who proposes the lowest price. The evaluations shall be provided to the city council for selection of the final award. The contract will be awarded, if award is made, by the city to the responsive and responsible proposer whose proposal is determined, in the city's exclusive discretion, to be the most advantageous to the city, taking into consideration price, qualifications, and other factors as indicated in the RFP.
g.
The city reserves the right to waive any informalities or irregularities of proposals, to request clarification of information submitted in any proposal, to further negotiate with a responsive and responsible proposer who has been selected for contract award, or to reject any or all proposals for any reason whatsoever.
h.
If no responsive and responsible proposals are received or all proposals are rejected, the city may procure such goods, services, and professional services by direct negotiation.
(m)
Quality based selections (QBS).
(1)
Request for qualifications (RFQ). Requests for qualifications (RFQ) may be used when it is determined to be in the city's best interest to evaluate the experience and qualifications of a service provider, without regard to price or prior to considering price.
a.
The procedure for soliciting, opening and evaluating statements of qualifications shall be the same as described herein for competitive sealed proposals. Service providers whose qualifications meet the criteria established in the RFQ, at the sole discretion of the city, may be considered for contract award by participation in the completion of price negotiation. The city shall attempt to negotiate a fee with the highest ranked firm. If no agreement is reached, the city shall begin negotiations with the next highest ranked firm. Negotiations will proceed in this manner until an agreement is reached. Alternatively, the city may, by direct negotiation, finalize terms with service providers who are selected for award based on qualifications. The city reserves the right to reject any or all responses for any reason. Clarification of information may be requested by the city.
b.
The RFQ process will be the method of procurement when the professional services exceed $25,000.00 and/or the project costs exceed $1,000,000.00 for the procurement of services within the scope of architecture, registered interior design, professional engineering, land surveying, and landscape architecture.
(2)
Multi-step solicitation. The city may initiate one of the multi-step solicitation processes described below when: (a) in the city's discretion, it is impractical to prepare an adequate or complete description of the goods or services desired (due to insufficient data, uncertain requirements, unfamiliar market options, etc.), (b) the city desires to identify a field of qualified bidders, proposers, goods or services, out of a broader field of bidders, proposers, goods or services, or (c) the city believes a multi-step process would best serve its purposes.
a.
Consecutive multi-step process:
1.
The city may request statements of qualifications to be evaluated based on the criteria in the RFQ for purposes of identifying one or more desirable or acceptable goods, services, or professional services or for purposes of identifying a field of qualified or most qualified bidders or proposers.
2.
After identifying a field of most qualified bidders or proposers with the capability of providing the desirable or acceptable goods, services, or professional services, the city may either follow a competitive ITB process or by a RFP process among the field of vendors identified as having the capability to meet the city's requirements for the procurement.
b.
Consecutive multi-step process to award standby purchasing contracts: A standby contract is an agreement between the City of South Fulton and an entity performing a professional or technical service. The use of standby contracts will be at the discretion of the city manager. The contract thresholds are subject to the bidding thresholds established in this chapter. The entities selected through this process are intended to create a pool of qualified vendors to be used on a rotational basis, or with the informal procurement process.
1.
When it is in the best interest of the city to have pre-qualified, standby purchasing contracts because of the need to provide quick-response, repetitive services or a range of services or professional services within a specific field of expertise, the city may use consecutive multi-step procurement process to identify one or more standby contractors. The purpose is to identify one or more standby contractors that demonstrate the ability to perform a particular type of service during a specified contract period.
2.
Contract award - The multi-step solicitation shall specify the general types of services required, the selection process to be used, and the selection criteria for award of the standby contract.
3.
Award of a specific scope of work to a standby contractor - During the term of the standby contract(s), specific scopes of work may be developed and awarded to standby contractor(s), by amendment to such standby contract(s), provided that the specific scope of work is consistent with the general types of services upon which award of the continuing contract(s) was made. On an annual basis, the maximum contract amount shall not exceed $1,000,000.00 with task order approval through the city manager.
4.
Except when the standby contract is for the procurement of services within the scope of architecture, registered interior design, professional engineering, land surveying or landscape architecture and when there is more than one standby contractor available to perform the specific scope of work defined, the process for award of the work is set forth below:
(a)
Work may be rotated during the contract period between the standby contractor(s) that were selected to perform the general type of services required; or,
(b)
Quotations, bids or proposals may be requested from the prequalified standby contractors that were selected to perform the general type of services or professional services required. The city may select the standby contractor whose quotation, bid, or proposal is deemed to be most advantageous to the city to perform the specific scope of work required.
5.
City departments shall use the list of approved standby contractors. A user department may choose to either use a rotation or informal bid process as referenced above when using a standby contract. The choice of the department will remain in effect for the term of the contract. This procurement strategy should allow vendors fair and consistent access to projects, improve quality of service delivery and generally increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the procurement process. The vendor rotation process shall include the list of the qualified vendors selected through procurement process to perform the work. The department will maintain a list of the qualified vendors and rotate through each vendor on an established basis.
6.
The informal bid process shall include the list of the qualified vendors selected through the procurement process to perform the work. This procurement strategy will require the departments to obtain at least three quotes for work above $2,501.00 and below the formal bid threshold. If three quotes are not obtained, detailed written explanation is required.
7.
All qualified vendors should be given equal access to projects, and through transparent monthly reporting a list of projects, vendor(s), awards, and purchase amount shall be maintained. If a vendor declines the project a written record shall be maintained, and the vendor shall be invited the next time the vendor's name is in the rotation.
8.
For the professional standby contracts, the department head will be responsible for providing the determination of the professional selection.
(n)
Protests.
(1)
Submission of protest. If a vendor or bidder is aggrieved during pending request for proposals, bids or qualifications, the vendor or bidder can choose to protest in accordance with this section.
a.
Bidders may protest the contract award in connection with the RFQ/ITB/RFP on which the bidder has submitted a bid/proposal. Any such protest by a bidder must be filed no later than ten calendar days following the date of the notice to award and/or conclusion of the RFQ/ITB/RFP, in order to have the protest considered.
b.
A written statement of protest pertaining to events or facts arising during a bid solicitation process, signed by a company officer authorized to sign contracts on behalf of the vendor, must be received by the purchasing department no later than three calendar days prior to the bid due date, with the exception that actions complained of occurring within three days of the bid due date shall be filed within 24 hours of the actions complained of. Failure to file a protest by the time required may be deemed a waiver of any grounds the vendor or bidder has to protest. All inquiries received after the bid award and/or after the conclusion of a RFQ/ITB/RFP will not be considered a formal protest.
(2)
Format of protest. Protests shall include:
a.

A written statement of protest to notice of non-award by a company officer authorized to sign contracts on behalf of the vendor, must be received by the purchasing department no later than ten calendar days following the date of the notice of non-award. Failure to file a protest by the time required may be deemed a waiver of any grounds the vendor or bidder has to protest. All inquiries received after the ten day period will not be considered a formal protest.
(4)
Stay of procurement during protest. When a protest pertaining to events or facts arising during a pending solicitation under this section (example: protests concerning specifications and evaluation criteria) has been filed no later than the three business days prior to the bid opening or deadline herein, the purchasing department shall suspend the award of a contract until a final decision has been issued, unless the purchasing department makes a written determination, after consulting with the issuing department, that awarding the contract without delay is necessary to protect the best interests of the city.
a.
When a protest has been filed in a timely fashion within ten calendar days following the issuance of a notice of non-award, the purchasing department shall consult with the city manager to determine if performance of the contract without delay is necessary to protect the best interests of the city.
b.
If it is determined that it is necessary to proceed with a contract without delay, the bidder that receives the contingent contract may proceed with performance and receive payment for work performed in strict accordance with the terms of the contract; however, such bidder shall not be entitled to reimbursement for any capital outlay costs, or other up front expenditures incurred in performing the contract.
(5)
Decision by purchasing department. A recommendation will be made by the purchasing department to the city attorney as expeditiously as possible after receiving all relevant requested information in regard to the protest filed. After consultation with the city attorney, the purchasing department will notify the bidder in writing of the decision no later than 30 days after all necessary paperwork is filed. If a protest is sustained, available remedies may include one of the following:
a.
For a protest sustained prior to an award, modification of the solicitation document, including but not limited to specifications, terms and conditions and evaluation criteria; and extension of the opening date, if appropriate.
b.
For a protest sustained after an award is made, suspension or cancellation of the award, re-evaluation and re-award or re-solicitation with appropriate changes to the new solicitation document.
(6)
Appeal. Decisions from the purchasing manager on a solicitation protest may be appealed to the city council. The request for appeal must be filed within seven calendar days of the decision complained of. The decisions of the city council shall be appealed as allowed by law.
(o)
Guidelines for promoting sustainability through the purchasing process. The city is a significant consumer of goods and services. The city desires to encourage the procurement of sustainable and environmentally preferred products and services. The City of South Fulton Mayor and Council have resolved that the city will take an active role to promote the analysis of life cycle costs for products and services to encourage protection of the environment by showing preference for the procurement of sustainable products and services for the use in city operations.
(1)
In general, environmentally preferable products and services are those that would reduce negative effects on human health and environment when compared with the competing products and services. More specifically, this comparison would include consideration of all phases of the product's life cycle, including raw materials acquisition, production, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, operation, maintenance and disposal, including potential for reuse or ability to be recycled.
(2)
In practice, the objective is to purchase products that have been environmentally certified or eco labeled because they have reduced environmental impact due to the way they are made, used, transported, stored, packaged and disposed. It means looking for products that do not harm human health, are less polluting and that minimize waste, maximize use of bio-based or recycled materials, conserve energy and water, and reduce the consumption of and disposal of hazardous materials.
(3)
Reports will be provided to city council on an annual basis to track the success of the environmentally preferable purchasing program that accounts for life cycle costs and gives preference to products that are recycled, recyclable and otherwise more environmentally friendly than traditional products; purchase Energy Star rated equipment and appliances when possible to do so and, purchase recycled copy, computer, and fax paper with at least 30 percent recycled content whenever the use of the paper makes it possible to do so.
