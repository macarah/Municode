DIVISION 2. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION DESIGN OPTION

Sec. 68-1706. - Purpose and intent.
This section is intended to allow for the development of conservation subdivisions that cluster development and provide for preservation of open space as an alternative to conventional subdivision development. This section is specifically intended:
(a)
To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural storm water runoff and watershed protection measure;
(b)
To provide a residential development option that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land;
(c)
To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat;
(d)
To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure including paved surfaces and utility easements necessary for residential development;
(e)
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development;
(f)
To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community;
(g)
To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdiction;
(h)
To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places, and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood;
(i)
To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries;
(j)
To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles;
(k)
To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space;
(l)
To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.

The applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the and all other applicable laws.
(b)
Ownership of development site: The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
(c)
Housing density determination: The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by development of a "Yield Plan." In a "Yield Plan," a conventional subdivision design plan is prepared by the applicant in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site plan but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and this chapter and all other applicable laws.
(d)
Minimum lot size: Once the maximum number of lots is determined through development of the "Yield Plan," a conservation subdivision layout is developed by meeting the requirements of this section. The minimum lot size in a conservation subdivision shall be 10,000 square feet or the area necessary to accommodate required water and waste disposal systems.

(a)
Suitability of the land: Land subject to flooding, improper drainage or erosion or that is for topographical or other reasons unsuitable for residential use that will contribute to danger to health, safety or property destruction unless the hazards can be and are corrected. No land determined to fall in a 25-year floodplain identified by state or federal authority shall be approved for any building site. All land falling into the 100-year flood zone must be so identified on the preliminary and final plats.
(b)
Name of subdivision: The name of the subdivision must have approval of the planning commission. The name shall not duplicate or closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision in the county.

Whenever the public body responsible for land acquisition executes a written release stating that the reserved land is not to be acquired, the planning commission shall waive the reservation requirements. When a development is of such size or of a nature which will have a significant impact on community facilities, the dedication of an appropriate amount of land to meet such needs may be required by the planning commission.
(b)
Whenever the planning commission finds that proposed reservation of land or dedication of land for public use is not required or suitable for such public use, it may require the rearrangement of lots to include such land.
(c)
In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for all natural features such as large trees and water courses as well as for historical sites and similar community assets. These, when preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the property or community.

(a)
Lots shall have no access to an arterial road, expressway or other limited access highway but only to rural minor access or residential streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an arterial, a limited access highway or a railroad right-of-way, the platting authorities shall require street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way either as a marginal access street or at a distance suitable for an appropriate use of the intervening land with a ten-foot, non-access reservation suitably planted. Due regard should be given requirements for approach grades and future grade separations in determining distances.
(b)
Alleys: Alleys may be required at the rear of all lots used for multi-family, commercial or industrial developments but shall not be provided in one- and two-family residential developments unless the subdivider provides evidence satisfactory to the platting authorities of the need for alleys.
(c)
Street right-of-way and roadway pavement widths: The right-of-way width shall be the distance across a street from property line to property line. All subdivision streets, public or private, shall be platted as right-of-way streets. Lots shall not include any portion of the right-of-way.

(6)
In meeting these grade and slope requirements on steep terrain, the planning commission suggests wherever feasible that the developer utilize a divided roadway in which the lanes for travel in opposite directions are cut at different levels of elevation. Under certain conditions, this method of giving separate treatment to each travel lane would lessen cut and fill requirements. Median cuts would be used at points where both lanes have the same roadway grade. The median cuts would shorten distance of traveling any one direction and facilitate access to lots served by each lane.

Rural arterial streets shall have a sight distance of at least 500 feet at four feet above ground level. (10 × the speed limit or 10 × the algebraic distance, per DOT/AASHTO.)
(2)
Rural major and collector streets shall have a sight distance of at least 200 feet at four feet above ground level.
(3)
Rural minor, residential streets and alleys and other lower classification rural roads (industrial/commercial access, agricultural access, recreation and scenic, and resource recovery) shall have a sight distance of at least 100 feet at four feet above ground level.
(4)
Rural arterial streets shall have a sight distance of at least 500 feet at four feet above ground level.
(5)
Local rural routes, 75 feet at four feet above ground level.
(j)
Street intersections: Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as possible. No street intersection shall be at an angle of less than 75 degrees, unless required by unusual circumstances.
(k)
Curb-line radii: Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a curb radius of 20 feet. Where the angle of intersection is less than 75 degrees, the platting authorities may require a greater radius. The platting authorities also may permit comparable cut-offs or chords in place of rounded corners.
(l)
Steep slope development: Street alignments are subject to performance standards as are appropriate to Habersham County and state construction requirements as may be adjusted to any given site limitations. Driveways and roads coming into a county road shall observe at a minimum a 25-foot deep area with a slope of no more than two percent at the intersection with the county right-of-way. No storm water shall run out onto the county road from a subdivision or individual lot or parcel. Storm water runoff coming from driveways shall be diverted into ditches and away from the county road.

(a)
Design criteria shall be in accordance with the requirements of this document or the latest edition of the Georgia Department of Transportation's "Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control."
(b)
A right turn deceleration lane shall be required at each subdivision of 25 lots or more and commercial or private industrial project creating more than 50 trips per day with a road/street intersecting with a public road. Right turn deceleration lanes shall have a minimum length of 150 feet with an additional 50 feet taper length. Pavement width shall be 18 feet (exclusive of curb and gutter) if curb and gutter is required. The design thickness of the base and pavement structure shall include eight-inch compacted graded aggregate base course, four-inch compacted asphalt concrete binder and two-inch compacted asphalt concrete "E" or "F" surface course. Additional right-of-way, if required, to accommodate the right turn deceleration lane and shoulder width to match the existing county road (in no case less than a four-foot wide shoulder) shall be acquired and dedicated by the developer to Habersham County at no cost. Associated drainage improvements as deemed necessary by the construction of the right turn deceleration lane shall be required.

Other access improvements may be required by the county upon the recommendation of either GDOT or the county engineer in order to ensure adequate site access, pedestrian access, convenience and safety to the motoring public.
(e)
The developer shall be responsible for the relocation of public or private utilities and drainage structures as may be occasioned by the required access improvements.
(f)
Subdivision street intersections with county maintained roads shall be located to provide adequate sight distance. Minimum intersection sight distances are criteria provided in Table (A) of this subsection. The line of sight establishes the boundary of a sight triangle within which there should be no sight obstruction between the heights of 30 inches and 108 inches. No plants or shrubs shall be planted in this area that grows to a height greater than 30 inches. The sight distance criteria are based on the average time required for a vehicle to make a left or right turn from a stop controlled approach to the public road (AASHTO Case B1 and B2). The time to execute the maneuver is based on recommendations contained in NCHPR Report 383, Intersection Sight Distance. The sight distances for a two-lane road are the distance traveled at the posted speed limit during the average of 6.5 and 7.5 seconds. See ASSHTO Green Book, chapter 9 Intersections, for adjustments due to grades greater than three percent and design vehicle other than passenger cars. The developer's engineer shall certify that sight distance requirements are in accordance with table (A) and so state on the preliminary plans at the time of submittal.
(g)
A traffic impact study by the developer's engineer at the preliminary stage when any new road or street is created that abuts/adjoins a public road/street for all developments creating more than 50 trips per day.
