Editor's note— An ordinance adopted June 20, 2016 supplied provisions to be added to this Code as Ch. 12, §§ 12-1—12-26. In order to preserve the style of this Code, at the discretion of the editor, these provisions have been redesignated as Ch. 20, §§ 20-1—20-26 to read as set out herein.

Sec. 20-1. - Intent.
The safe operating of motor vehicles, and the need to minimize potential nuisance factors resulting from conflicts between commercial or industrial traffic utilizing streets designed for residential traffic, are issues which directly relate to the public health, safety, and welfare of residents in the county. The appropriate design and location of driveways can significantly lessen the adverse effects related to these issues. The establishment of reasonable design standards and administrative procedures included herein shall aid in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the county.
(Ord. of 6-20-2016 )
Sec. 20-2. - Purpose of design standards.
The purpose of this chapter is:
(1)
To ensure that vehicles leave or join the roadway traffic at a proper angle and in conformity with the rules of the road.
(2)
To reduce hazard to vehicles by reducing areas of conflict and points of conflict between vehicles.
(3)
To increase the capacity of roads and intersections by reducing areas of conflict between vehicles.
(4)
To provide sufficient space for the installation of traffic control devices, utilities and crosswalks.
(5)
To reduce hazard to pedestrians by reducing areas of possible conflict between pedestrians and vehicles, and to define such areas.
(6)
To provide reasonable assurance against the hazardous and indiscriminate use of highway right-of-way through encroachment.
(7)
To provide a maximum practical sight distance, especially at intersections.
(8)
To provide uniform and impartial consideration in all cases where access is required by abutting property owners.
(9)
To reduce the possibility of conflicts between commercial/industrial traffic generators and residential areas.

(Ord. of 6-20-2016 )
Sec. 20-6. - General design standards.
The location, design and construction of the driveway shall be in accordance with the following standards. These standards are in no case to be modified unless specifically authorized by the building official:
(1)
A driveway shall be located and restricted as to width as necessary driveway and its appurtenances are contained within the frontage along the highway of the property served. At public highway intersections a driveway shall not provide direct ingress or egress to or from the public highway intersection area and shall not encroach on or occupy areas of the roadway or right-of-way deemed necessary for effective traffic control or for highway signs or signals. A driveway shall be so located and constructed that vehicles approaching or using it will have adequate sight distance in both directions along the highway.
(2)
The number of driveways permitted serving a single property frontage shall be a maximum of two unless more are deemed necessary by the public works director for reasonable service to the property without undue impairment of safety, convenience, and utility of the highway.
(3)
If the property has frontage on more than one street, and a driveway permit is requested, the building official may request a recommendation from the public works director, planning director, or planning commission as to the potential adverse effects which may result. If it is determined that it would cause a nuisance to the surrounding area, or a traffic hazard, or unduly congest traffic, then the permit may be denied.
(4)
The island area on the right-of-way between successive driveways or adjoining a driveway and between the highway shoulder and right-of-way line shall remain unimproved for vehicular travel or parking. Such areas shall be considered as restricted and may be filled in or graded down only as hereinafter provided in subsection (8) of this section.
(5)
The surface of the driveway connecting with rural type highway sections shall slope down and away from the highway shoulder a sufficient amount and distance to preclude ordinary surface water drainage from the driveway area flooding onto the highway roadbed.
(6)
The driveway shall not obstruct or impair drainage in side ditches or roadside areas. Driveway culverts, where necessary, shall be adequate for surface water drainage along the roadway and in no case less than the equivalent of 15-inch diameter pipe. The distance between culverts under successive driveways shall be not less than ten feet except as such restricted area is permitted to be filled in under the provisions of subsection (8) of this section. All driveway culverts shall be constructed of the following materials and meet Georgia Department of Transportation (D.O.T.) specifications:
a.
Reinforced concrete pipe (RCP), D.O.T. approved Class III or better.
b.
Corrugated metal pipe, D.O.T. approved, type II aluminized steel. This material is prohibited in live stream applications.
c.
High density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe, D.O.T. approved, dual walled.
(7)
Driveways connecting to "L" back curb and gutter must be constructed by removing the curb and gutter and pouring a valley gutter. When curb and gutter is removed for constructing a driveway, the new connections shall be of equivalent acceptable material and curb returns shall be provided or restored in a neat, workmanlike manner. The driveway or valley gutter surface shall connect with the highway pavement and sidewalks, if any, in a neat workmanlike manner. In no case shall the driveway construction impair the flow of water in the gutter. Figures 7 and 8 depict the proper details for constructing a valley gutter.
(8)
Driveways connecting to rolled curb and gutter may be constructed by either pouring the driveway directly up to the back of the curb or by removing the curb and gutter and pouring a valley gutter. When curb and gutter is removed for constructing a driveway, the new connections shall be of equivalent acceptable material and curb returns shall be provided or restored in a neat, workmanlike manner. The driveway or valley gutter surface shall connect with the highway pavement and sidewalks, if any, in a neat workmanlike manner. In no case shall the driveway construction impair the flow of water in the gutter. Figures 7 and 8 depict the proper details for constructing a valley gutter.
(9)
Any activities that impair the flow of water in a curb and gutter are prohibited. These prohibited activities include, but are not limited to: The filling in of curb and gutter with concrete or asphalt, or the removal of curb and gutter without providing an acceptable valley gutter as described in [subsections] (7) and (8) above.
(10)
The restricted area between successive driveways may be filled in or graded down only when the following requirements are fully complied with:
a.
The filling or grading down shall be to grades approved by the public works director; and, except where drainage is by means of curb and gutter, water drainage of the area shall be directed away from the highway roadbed in a suitable manner.
b.
Culvert extension under the restricted area shall be of like size and equivalent acceptable material of the driveway culvert, and intermediate manholes adequate for clean-out purposes may be required where the total culvert length exceeds 100 feet.
c.
Where no side ditch separates the restricted area from the roadbed, permanent provision may be required to separate the areas from the highway roadbed, to prevent its use for driveway or parking purposes, by construction of a border, curb, rail or posts deemed adequate by the public works director.
(Ord. of 6-20-2016 )

Sec. 20-11. - Maximum percentage of frontage for driveway use.
(a)
Each single driveway shall have a maximum width of 30 percent of the property frontage. Where two or more driveways are permitted, no more than 60 percent of property frontage shall be used as driveways.
(b)
No approval for a curb cut will be given where it is apparent that the intent is not to provide access but to provide parking only. A driveway approach must provide access to something definite on private property such as a parking area considerably greater in extent than the width of the driveway, or provide access to a driveway, or to a door at least eight feet wide intended for the entrance of vehicles, etc. (not applicable for residential driveways).
(Ord. of 6-20-2016 )
Sec. 20-12. - Distance to side property lines.
(a)
The area within five feet of a frontage boundary line shall be a restricted area on which no driveway may be developed on public right-of-way (E).
(b)
A minimum of 1½ feet of pavement edge or curb shall be left undisturbed adjacent to each frontage boundary line to serve as an island area. This distance shall be measured between the FB line and the point of tangency of the driveway radius and the edge of the pavement measured along the edge of the pavement.
(c)
Subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall apply, whichever is more restrictive.
(d)

(1)
Distance between double driveways (D), ten feet minimum at narrowest point;
(2)
Minimum island depth, four feet where parking abuts street right-of-way line.
(b)
Treatment of island or buffer area. In the development of private property and the construction of driveways thereto, it may be necessary to regrade the buffer area by cutting or filling. Such work shall be done in a manner to insure adequate sight distance for traffic operations, proper drainage, suitable slopes for maintenance operations, and good appearance. The buffer area outside the driveways shall be treated to prevent use by vehicles. This may be accomplished by grading, or use of curbs, rails, guide posts, low walls, low shrubs, etc., in a manner which will not impair clear sight across the area.
(c)
Visibility clearance. No landscaping, fences, terraces, or other natural or artificial features adjacent to any street shall be of a nature impairing visibility from or of approaching vehicular traffic where such visibility is important to safety, nor shall such features in any way create potential hazards to pedestrians. In particular, at vehicular entrances and exits, no off-street parking, landscaping, or other material impediment to visibility between the height of three feet and ten feet, measured from the roadway level, shall be permitted within triangular areas defined by lines connecting points described as follows:
a.
Nonresidential use. Beginning at a point where the midline of the entrance or exit intersects the public right-of-way, thence to a point of 35 feet along the right-of-way in the direction of approaching traffic, thence to a point of 25 feet toward the interior of the lot along the midline of the entrance or exit, and thence to a point of beginning. (See figure Sec. 20-13 A [Sec. 20-23 5A].)
b.
Multifamily residential use. Beginning at a point where the midline of the entrance or exit intersects the public right-of-way, thence to a point of ten feet along the right-of-way in the direction of approaching traffic, thence to a point of ten feet toward the interior of the lot along the midline of the entrance or exit, and thence to the point of beginning. (See figure Sec. 20-23 B [Sec. 20-23 5B].)
(Ord. of 6-20-2016 )
Sec. 20-14. - Intersection clearance.
The length, width and shape of corner island areas will vary for different locations. The angle of intersection, angle of driveways, width of the right-of-way on both approaches, channelization radii, and other conditions will influence the location of driveways at intersections. The location and angle of an approach in relation to the highway intersection shall be such that a vehicle leaving the service facility may be merged in the lane of traffic moving in the desired direction before crossing the intersection, and that a vehicle entering the facility from the intersection may do so in an orderly and safe manner with a minimum of interference to through traffic.
The following conditions may be applicable in most instances:
(1)
No driveway shall be allowed to encroach upon pavement edge radii.
(2)
The following minimum distances from the intersection right-of-way line (C) shall apply where there is no conflict with the foregoing conditions:
a.
Traffic volume A.D.T. of 1,500 or less, 20 feet;
b.
Traffic volume A.D.T. over 1,500 but less than 10,000, 35 feet;
c.
Traffic volume A.D.T. over 10,000 but less than 15,000, 50 feet;
d.
Traffic volume A.D.T. over 15,000, 65 feet.
The public works director shall have the authority to increase these distances if in his opinion such action is necessary for the protection of traffic. The public works director may also modify these requirements if justifiable on the basis of site conditions.
(Ord. of 6-20-2016 )
Sec. 20-15. - Parking and storage areas.
(a)
Each roadside business establishment, when providing off-street parking or storage space, shall provide such parking or storage space off the right-of-way to prevent the storage of vehicles on the driveway or the backing up of traffic on the travel way. This is particularly needed for businesses where a number of vehicles will be leaving and entering at the same time.
(b)
Particular attention will be paid to drive-in facilities such as banks, minute car washes, drive-in restaurants, drive-in bill paying facilities, and other service facilities where motorists are served while in their vehicles, to insure that queues of vehicles will not extend out onto the public streets.
(Ord. of 6-20-2016 )
Sec. 20-16. - Driveway grade.
(a)
Residential driveways: The maximum grade which shall be permitted is 17 percent.
(b)
Apartment, commercial and industrial driveways: The maximum grade which shall be permitted is eight percent.
(c)
Grades within the right-of-way shall be controlled by existing shoulder slope or existing and future sidewalk elevations.
