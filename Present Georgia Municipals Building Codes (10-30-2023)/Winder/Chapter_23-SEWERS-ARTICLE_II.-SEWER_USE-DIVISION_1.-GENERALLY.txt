DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 23-11. - Purpose and policy.
This article sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly owned treatment works for the city and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code section 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 403). The objectives of this article are:
(1)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned treatment works that will interfere with its operation;
(2)
Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned treatment works that will pass through the publicly owned treatment works, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with the publicly owned treatment works;
(3)
To protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the general public;
(4)
To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge from the publicly owned treatment works;
(5)
To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance and improvement of the publicly owned treatment works; and
(6)
To enable the city to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other federal and state laws to which the publicly owned treatment works is subject.
This article shall apply to all users of the publicly owned treatment works. The article authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; provides for monitoring, compliance and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.

Pretreatment. The reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in wastewater prior to, or in lieu of, introducing such pollutants into the POTW.
