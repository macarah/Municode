Editor's note— Ord. of (W-9-94), adopted Nov. 8, 1994, purported to delete § 13-39; however, in light of the subject matter, it is presumed to be the intent of the city that § 13-139 be deleted. Prior to deletion, § 13-139 pertained to a license fee for dealers in precious metals and derived from an ordinance of Dec. 2, 1980. For current provisions relating to such subject matter, the user's attention is directed to § 13-3.
