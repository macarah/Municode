Sec. 23-161. - Purpose, scope, and policy.
This article is designed to facilitate the maximum beneficial public use of the city's sewer system while preventing blockages and overflows of sewer system resulting from discharges of FOG into the city's sewer system and to specify appropriate FOG discharge requirements for all facilities emitting FOG.
By enactment of this article, the city intends to exercise its authority over sizing, location, maintenance, and material of grease traps and/or interceptors within the city limits.
The provisions of this article shall apply to the direct or indirect discharge of all wastewater or waste containing FOG discharged into the city sewer system.
This article establishes quantity and quality standards on all wastewater and/or waste discharges containing FOG; which may alone or collectively cause or contribute to FOG accumulation in the sewer system causing or potentially causing or contributing to the occurrence of sanitary sewer overflows and blockages.
