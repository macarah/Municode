ARTICLE IXA. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)

Sec. 9A-1. - Purpose.
A.
The purpose of this District is to provide for appropriate planned development of quality projects within the City of Winder by allowing greater freedom of design, by improving the opportunity for flexibility and creativity in the land development processes, by undertaking techniques which foster community and pedestrianism, and by limiting the expenditure of public funds in an effort to achieve the objectives and intent of the City's Comprehensive Plan.
B.
The proposed PUD may depart from strict conformance with the requirements of zoning and subdivision requirements to the extent specified in the master development plan and documents authorizing the PUD so long as tangible benefits are provided to the neighborhood or community in which it is located. These benefits shall be in the form of provisions of exceptional amenities, design excellence, etc. The waiver of any requirement shall be the direct cause of accrual of positive benefits to the residents of the development as well as to the general community.
C.
Specifically, the District is intended to promote the following objectives:
(1)
Provide for flexibility and creativity in responding to changing social, economic, and market conditions and that results in greater public benefits than could be achieved using conventional zoning and development regulations;
(2)
Implementation and consistency with the City's adopted plans and policies;
(3)
Efficient and economical provision of public facilities and services;
(5)
Variety in housing types and sizes to accommodate households of all ages, sizes, incomes, and lifestyle choices;
(7)
A coordinated transportation system that includes an inter-connected hierarchy of appropriately designed improvements for motorized and nonmotorized transportation;
(8)
Compatibility of buildings and other improvements as determined by their arrangement, massing, form, character, and landscaping to establish a high-quality livable environment;
(9)
The incorporation of open space amenities and natural resource features into the development design;
(10)
Conservation of natural amenities of the land by encouraging the preservation of environmentally significant, scenic, and functional open space;
(11)
Attractive, high-quality landscaping, lighting, architecture, and signage that reflects the unique character of the development;
(12)
Allow for and encourage diversification of uses, structures, densities, and open spaces and innovative concepts such as zero lot lines, townhouse-condominiums, traditional neighborhoods, villages, cluster-type, conservation subdivisions; mixed uses; and multi-uses.
(13)
Provide maximum opportunity for the application of innovative site planning concepts through the creation of aesthetically pleasing environments for living, shopping and working on properties of adequate size, shape, and location.
(14)
Ensure that development will occur according to the advantages and limitations of land, site design, population density, building coverage, improvement standards, and construction phasing as authorized through the approval of a comprehensive site development plan.
(15)
Encourage and allow the development of tracts of land as planned neighborhoods or communities according to designs that coordinate building forms that are interrelated and architecturally harmonious.
(16)
Encourage and allow more unique, flexible, creative, imaginative arrangements and mixes of land use in site planning and development than are permitted through zoning district requirements established in this Code, but not in conflict with the Comprehensive Plan of the City.
(17)
Encourage and allow for developments that offer enhanced protection of natural resources and sensitive environmental features, including streams, water bodies, floodplains, wetlands, steep slopes, woodlands and native plant communities
(18)
Encourage a broader mix of residential housing types, including detached and attached dwellings, than would normally be constructed in conventional subdivisions, and provide for unique dwelling arrangements not typically provided in conventional subdivisions.
(19)
Preserve the natural amenities of the land through maintenance of conservation areas and open spaces within developments, provide amenities, and provide, where needed, the civic and semi-public uses that help to make up a community.
(20)
Provide for the efficient use of land by encouraging smaller networks of utilities and streets which may lower development and housing costs.
(21)
Provide an environment of stable character compatible with surrounding residential areas.
D.
This District is not intended to be used as an alternative to obtaining variances for developments unable to comply with other zoning district provisions.
E.
The District is not intended to increase overall density or development intensity on a particular property except in relation to an improved design and benefit to the public through improved development through creative design and appropriate mixture of land uses.

There are no pre-specified permitted or special uses for the PUD District.
