PART I - CHARTER LAWS[1]
Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Georgia Laws 1974, Act No. 1165, enacted a new charter for the city, as set out in Subpart A, and repealed the city's former charter, derived from Georgia Laws 1917, page 926, as amended by: Georgia Laws 1931, page 1033; Georgia Laws 1943, page 1641; Georgia Laws 1956, page 2985; Georgia Laws 1961, page 2559; and Georgia Laws 1964, page 2347. The absence of a history note in parentheses following a particular section indicates that the section is derived unchanged from Georgia Laws 1974, Act No. 1165.
Several provisions of the city's former charter laws have been deleted as being superseded by the new charter. They are provisions on zoning and planning (Georgia Laws 1938, page 1373); gas distribution (Georgia Laws 1952, page 2475); real property evaluation (Georgia Laws 1956, page 3100); and extension of corporate limits (Georgia Laws 1958, page 2390; and Georgia Laws 1960, page 2909). Provisions concerning the city-county airport authority were designated as Subpart B and have been deleted at the request of the city since the city no longer participates in the airport authority.

If an independent city assessment is made, a board of equalization, consisting of three (3) freeholders of the city appointed by the mayor and council with compensation fixed by ordinance, shall hear appeals of taxpayers taken within ten (10) days after the city clerk has sent a notice, by ordinary mail, of a new or increased assessment; provided that such notice shall not be required, nor may appeals be taken, in the case of initial city assessments that are the same as county assessments.

On and after the date when such taxes become delinquent, the tax records of the city shall have the force and effect of a judgment of a court of record.
(2)
Said city shall have the right, power and authority to provide by ordinance for the return of all real and personal property for taxation; to provide for the compelling of such return; and to provide penalties for failure to do so after due notice and hearing to be prescribed by the mayor and council, for the current or any previous year, not in any conflict with any limitation prescribed by the law of Georgia; to prescribe the time or times at which said returns are due; and to provide the time or times when said taxes shall be due and payable.
