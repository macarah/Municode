Sec. 2-99. - Enforcement hearings.
(a)
Conduct of hearings.
(1)
The land use board shall hold a hearing on the allegations of the enforcement notice at the date, time and place set forth in that notice.
(2)
For the purposes of this section, the term "parties" shall refer to the director and all persons to whom an enforcement notice is sent pursuant to subsection 2-98(d).
(3)
Postponement. Three days before the scheduled date of the hearing, any party may for good cause request in writing from the land use board a postponement or advancement of the hearing. The requesting party shall transmit a copy of the request to all parties, whereupon all parties may promptly respond in writing to the request. The land use board, acting through its chairman, shall consider the request for postponement or advancement if the requesting party shows good cause to grant the request and no other party shows good cause to deny the request. A request for postponement or advancement may be denied if any party shows good cause why it should be denied. The land use board, acting through its chairman, shall notify all parties in writing whether or not a postponement or advancement has been granted and, if so, its duration.
a.
If a written request is received less than three days before the date of the hearing, a postponement may be by agreement between parties, or the land use board may grant a postponement within its discretion.
b.
It shall constitute good cause to postpone the hearing when one or more of the persons alleged in the enforcement notice to have violated county ordinances has not been duly served with the enforcement notice at least five days before the hearing.
c.
It shall constitute good cause to postpone the hearing when a party other than one alleged in the enforcement notice to have violated county ordinances has not been duly served with the enforcement notice at least five days before the hearing.
(b)
Submitting written responses.
(1)
Any party may submit to the land use board a written response to the enforcement notice before the hearing. A copy of the response shall be submitted to all other parties simultaneously and in the same manner that the response was submitted to the land use board.
(2)
If all persons alleged in the enforcement notice to be violating or have violated county ordinances submit a written response in which they admit the validity of all allegations of the enforcement notice and consent to the remedies and penalties requested by the director in the enforcement notice, then:
a.
There shall be no hearing;
b.
The allegations of the enforcement notice shall be the determination of the land use board in the enforcement order as if there were a hearing on the allegations; and
c.
The remedies and penalties applied in the enforcement order shall be those requested in the enforcement notice, or such other remedies and penalties as are proposed by the parties and approved by the land use board.
(3)
If all persons alleged in the enforcement notice to be violating or have violated county ordinances submit such a written response in which they admit the validity of all allegations of the enforcement notice, but one or more parties contest or object to the remedies or penalties requested in the enforcement notice, then:
a.
The allegations of the enforcement notice shall be the determination of the land use board in the enforcement order as if there were a hearing on the allegations; and
b.
A hearing shall be held, but only on the issue of the remedies and penalties to be applied in the enforcement order.
(4)
If one or more, but not all, persons alleged in the enforcement notice to be violating or have violated county ordinances submit such a written response in which they admit the validity of all allegations of the enforcement notice, the response or responses shall be given due weight by the land use board but the hearing shall proceed on all relevant issues.
(c)
Appearance of parties. All persons alleged in the enforcement notice to be violating or have violated county ordinances shall have an opportunity to be present at the hearing, either in person or through legal counsel. A default decision that the person has violated county ordinances as alleged may be made if such a person was duly served with an enforcement notice, is not present at the hearing, and there is a finding that there is or was a violation of county ordinances.
(d)
Right to present evidence. At the hearing, any party, except parties who, pursuant to subsection (b) above, are not entitled to a hearing, may present evidence and testimony, summon witnesses, question all witnesses and be represented by and receive the advice of legal counsel.
(e)
Standards for decisions. The issues for the land use board to decide, by a preponderance of the evidence, are:
(1)
Whether the alleged violator or violators are violating or have violated any county ordinances;
(2)
If so, what remedies or penalties are appropriate and just, taking into consideration the requests of the director in the enforcement notice.
(f)
Interpretation of ordinances. The interpretation or meaning of any county ordinance shall be a valid issue for the land use board to decide. The validity or constitutionality of any county ordinance shall not be a valid issue for determination at the hearing, except in such cases that a person alleged to have violated a regulation claims in good faith that the regulation in question is directly contrary to another regulation of equal or superior force, which he or she alleges that he or she has not violated. Questions of validity or constitutionality of any county ordinance, or amendment of the local comprehensive plan, that are properly raised before the land use board shall be preserved for appeal.
(Ord. of 8-6-02; Ord. of 10-1-02, § 3)
Sec. 2-100. - Enforcement order; remedies and penalties.
(a)
Issuance of enforcement order.
(1)
Within ten days of the enforcement hearing, or from the date upon which the hearing was to be held if there was no hearing, the land use board shall issue in writing an appropriate enforcement order. The order shall be sent by certified mail or facsimile to all parties.
(2)
The enforcement order shall state the determination of the land use board regarding the allegations of the enforcement notice, and shall state in reasonable detail all legal and factual bases for that determination.
(3)
If the land use board determines that no violation of county ordinances is being or has been committed by any person alleged to have done so in the enforcement notice, the enforcement notice shall be dismissed and the enforcement order shall so state.
(4)
If the land use board determines that a violation of county ordinances is being or has been committed, the enforcement order shall state the appropriate and just remedies or penalties, and shall state the party or parties against which the enforcement order is effective. The remedies and penalties may include:
a.
An order to cease and desist from continuing and future violation of county ordinances;
b.
An order to bring the property in question into compliance with county ordinances;
c.
An order to perform a specific act or acts, or to refrain from a specific act or acts, which effectuates the purposes of subsections (a)(4)a. and b. above;
d.
Authorization for the department to enter upon the property and take all reasonable necessary steps to place the property in compliance with county ordinances, combined with an order to compensate the department for all reasonable expenses incurred pursuant to this subparagraph; and
e.
An order to pay to the county a fine. Such fine shall not exceed $1,000.00 for each day of violation.
(5)
Any owner or occupant of the property may be subject to an order pursuant to subsections (a)(4)a. through d. above, even if he or she is not determined in the enforcement order to be a violator. Only a violator may be subject to an order pursuant to subsection (a)(4)e.
(6)
The enforcement order may include authorization for employees or agents of the director to enter upon the property in question in order to find that the enforcement order is being or has been compliant. Entrance upon land pursuant to an enforcement order, or any supplemental enforcement order, and to this section shall not constitute a violation of subsection 2-95(a)(4), nor shall any owner or occupant of the property have a cause of action for trespass except intentional, knowing, or reckless damage to the property.
(b)
Monitoring compliance.
(1)
The director shall monitor compliance with the enforcement order. If the director has reason to believe that any person subject to the enforcement order is not complying with the enforcement order, the director may, at its option, either:
a.
Refer the matter to the county attorney for the commencement of a civil action.
b.
Commence a supplemental enforcement action pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section; or
c.
Refer the matter to the solicitor or district for the commencement of criminal proceedings. A referral or commencement under this paragraph (b)(1) does not preclude a later referral or commencement when noncompliance is alleged to be continuing or a new act of noncompliance is alleged.
(2)
A supplemental enforcement action is commenced by the director by filing a petition with the land use board stating its belief that one or more persons subject to the enforcement order are not complying with the enforcement order, and the reasons for this belief.
a.
A copy of the petition shall be sent by the director to all parties by certified mail or by facsimile. Any party alleged in the petition to be in noncompliance shall respond to the petition in writing, and any other party may respond to the petition in writing.
b.
Upon receipt of the petition and of the responses of all parties required to respond, the land use board shall schedule a hearing on the petition and shall notify all parties of the date, time and place by certified mail or facsimile. If any party required to respond to the petition does not do so within fifteen days of receiving the petition, the land use board may schedule the hearing regardless.
c.
The hearing shall be subject to the same rules and held according to the same procedures as an enforcement hearing pursuant to this division.
d.
The land use board shall issue a supplemental enforcement order within five days of the completion of the hearing.
e.
If the land use board finds that there is compliance with the enforcement order, then the petition shall be dismissed and the supplemental enforcement order shall so state.
f.
If the land use board finds that there is continued noncompliance with the enforcement order, then the land use board shall include in the supplemental enforcement order an order or authorization:
1.
That the person or persons in noncompliance pay an additional fine, either a single fine or a fine assessed for each day of noncompliance;
2.
That the director enter upon the property and take all reasonably necessary steps to place the property in compliance with county ordinances, and that the person or persons in noncompliance compensate the director for all reasonable expenses incurred pursuant to this subparagraph;
3.
That the matter be referred to the county attorney for the commencement of a civil action.
4.
That the matter is referred to the prosecuting authority for the commencement of criminal proceedings.
(c)
Administrative fines.
(1)
The land use board, upon notification by the director that an order of the land use board has not been complied with by the set time may order the violator to pay an administrative fine in an amount specified in this section.
(2)
An administrative fine imposed pursuant to this section for a violation involving the health or safety of a third party shall not exceed $1000.00 per day.
(3)
An administrative fine imposed pursuant to this section for a violation that is not a violation involving the health or safety of a third party shall not exceed a total of $1,000.00.
(4)
In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the land use board shall consider the following factors:
a.
The gravity of the violation;
b.
Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and
c.
Any previous violations committed by the violator.
(5)
The land use board may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section.
(d)
Recording an order. The director is hereby authorized to record a certified copy of an order imposing an administrative fine in the public records of any county that thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon a petition to the superior court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the land use board may request the county attorney to foreclose on the lien.
(e)
Outstanding fines. An outstanding unpaid administrative fine will preclude the issuance of any further permit or certificate of occupancy by the department for persons against whom the fine is imposed.
(f)
Length of liens. No lien imposed under this chapter shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the foreclosure. The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.
(g)
Appeals to superior court. An aggrieved party, including the board of commissioners, may appeal a final administrative order of the land use board to the superior court. Such an appeal shall be a hearing de novo. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the date the final order is issued.
