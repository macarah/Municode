(7)
The commission may require any dead-end road to provide a cul-de-sac with not less than a 50-foot radius from the center.
(8)
The road must have a minimum graded width of 30 feet; this would allow for 20-foot paving with five foot shoulders should the county decide to upgrade this road in the future.
(9)
The board of commissioners, though a variance procedure, can look at other criteria provided by the parties involved.
(Ord. of 4-11-95)
Sec. 74-83. - Road criteria, previously maintained roads.
The purpose of these criteria is to provide a means for accepting and maintaining roads that at one time were maintained by the county, which may or may not have deeded rights-of-way, but, for whatever reason, the road was left off or either deleted from the Official Carroll County Road Registry of 1985, but which continue to serve as a means for residents to access their homes. This would not include roads which have been officially abandoned by the county.
(1)
Except in the instance of the addition of a cut-through road or bypass road that is requested by the roads superintendent as needed to improve the safe, economical or efficient flow of traffic within the county by the general public, a resident who is living on the road must request the county to maintain the road before it will be considered for addition to the roads registry. The resident must be living on the road as of the date of this article as set out below.
(2)
To be considered for placement on the county roads registry as an official county public road, it must be established to the satisfaction of the chairman of the board of commissioners that:
a.
The road was considered a county road at some time in the past;
b.
Said road was, at sometime in the past, worked by the county as a public road for a period in excess of seven years;
c.
The present roadbed is the same or essentially the same as that previously worked by the county; and,
d.
The road will service the properties of more than one individual or that the road is needed for efficient, safe and convenient flow of traffic for the general public as a cut-through or bypass road between two roads presently on the county roads registry.
(3)
In order to satisfy the requirements set out in section (b) above, the chairman may consider and accept as evidence of prior use as a county road such information as old county or state road maps; recitation in ancient instruments or deeds; aerial photos; old surveys performed by official registered land surveyors; affidavits of individuals having particular knowledge of the area and the old roadbed and the working of the same; affidavits of former roads employees of the county as to the prior working of the road; the shape and contour of the roadbed itself, the depth of cuts, banks and ditches on the road; whether the road is presently or at some time in the past has been used for school bus traffic or as a rural mail delivery route; utility service on the road, etc.
(4)
If the chairman believes that the old roadbed meets the requirements for addition to the roads registry, he or she shall:
a.
Contact the commissioner(s) within whose district the road is located to determine if that commissioner is aware of the requested addition of the road to the registry, and
b.
Request the roads superintendent to examine the road and define the beginning point and ending point, length of the road and point at which private driveways may intersect the road.
(5)
The chairman shall thereafter submit the road to the board of commissioners, at a regularly called meeting, for a vote on whether the road will be added to the official roads registry. At this meeting, it will be expected that the roads superintendent or his designee shall make a recommendation for or against official acceptance of the road. The road will be accepted only upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners, and the vote shall be placed on the minutes of the meeting. If accepted, the road shall be officially named and shall be submitted to the roads superintendent for addition to the official roads registry and reported to the state for addition to the county roads map as published by the state. The road shall not be graded, scraped or otherwise "worked" until after its acceptance by the board as reflected in the official county minutes.
(6)
Any other acceptance factors not covered in the criteria set out in section (3) shall be determined by the board of commissioners.
(7)
The right-of-way shall be the same as that required for a Class V road set out in section 12-29(d) below.
(8)
Any dead-end road shall require a minimum 50-foot cul-de-sac.
(Ord. of 4-11-95)
Sec. 74-84. - Road and street classifications and limitation of maintenance.

Editor's note— Provided for by existing ordinance for acceptance and maintenance of public streets, § 74-26 et seq.

Sec. 74-102. - Procedure for obtaining street acceptance and maintenance under the street acceptance and maintenance ordinance.
Once the program is initiated, the following is the step-by-step procedure for property owner/resident to obtain acceptance and maintenance for their respective streets:
When the county manager or executive officer receives a request for acceptance and maintenance of a public street or road (as defined herein) he shall inform the person that this can be accomplished only on a petition basis and completion of the following steps:
(1)
Someone, other than county personnel, must circulate a petition obtaining the signatures of all or 100 percent of the property owners, not tenant, who won all or 100 percent of the street side frontage abutting the street (road) and desiring the acceptance and maintenance. The county manager then gives (or mails) the petition form, appendix A and B to the person for circulation among the property owners.
(2)
Upon receipt of the signed petition (by 100 percent of the abutting property owners) the county manager authenticates the signatures from the property records on file in the tax assessor's office. When this is completed, the county manager/executive officer will direct the county engineering department to survey the roadbed and prepare the necessary right-of-way is required drawings, and determine in which class the road should be accepted in. If additional right-of-way is required, the petitioners will be asked to complete appendix C, petition 2. Appendix C is not set out herein but is on file and available for inspection in the office of the county clerk.
(3)
When the survey has been completed and the required right-of-way and classifications are completed the county manager/county engineer/board of commissioners will meet with the petitioners (or steering committee) and present and discuss this material with them. All aspects of the project will be discussed at this meeting, and if the minimum right-of-way can be obtained and if all petitioners agree to the classification, the county commissioners will act on the petition, at the next scheduled meeting.
(4)
When (if) the property owners wish to upgrade the road to a higher classification the county manager will direct the petitioners to complete appendix D, petition 3. Appendix D is not set out herein, but is on file and available for inspection in the office of the county clerk. This petition must be signed by all or 100 percent of the property owners; when (if) all signatures and agreement are obtained, then a resolution providing for the construction and the payment (or assessment) of the construction cost from the abutting property owners is prepared and forwarded to the board of commissioners of the county for their approval (see appendix D).
(5)
Construction work and pavement will be scheduled on a priority basis as a part of the overall continuous work program of the respective departments.
(Ord. of 4-11-95)
Sec. 74-103. - Assessments to property owners for improvements to upgrade road to higher classification.
(a)
The cost of necessary work and improvements shall be entirely the responsibility of the abutting property owners who principally and collectively profit most from these improvements. Actual pavement costs only will be borne by the county government.
(b)
The appropriate charge to abutting property owners for reimbursement of "actual costs incurred" for the improved street shall be added to their annual tax assessment by the county tax assessor. Or if preferable, a system of "lump sum" advance payment or direct billing shall be optional at the discretion of the county board of commissioners.
(c)
Abutting property owners shall be assessed on the basis of front footage owned, as based upon property records on file with the county tax assessor. In the event of unusual factors, such as improvements needed for only a single, or a few of the abutting properties and not the whole of the abutting properties, the county manager/executive officer shall recommend to the petitioners and to the board of commissioners his judgment of an equitable assessment under the prevailing circumstances not covered in this article.
(d)
Direct assessments for improvements (if this method of payment is used) will begin at the beginning of the next calendar quarter following completion of the street.
(e)
The county board of commissioners will hear any request for relief in extraordinary cases and determine if those assessments should be adjusted.
(f)
The county board of commissioners may authorize a change in assessments from time to time as necessary or desirable.
(g)
Where commercial and/or industrial areas request acceptance and maintenance for streets or an identical status (public streets as defined herein) such streets and areas are included within the scope and jurisdiction of this article. All rules pertaining to assessment and procedures described herein shall apply to such properties.
This general policy information will be given to those persons requesting acceptance and maintenance of streets and the petition will include proper reference to costs, etc. of the necessary construction and improvements.
(Ord. of 4-11-95)
Sec. 74-104. - Recommended charges for street improvements.
The following rates are recommended as a base for assessments and should not be construed as fixed or set rates:
Due to the nature and complexities of this type of construction; varying field conditions; varying degrees of inadequacy; varying severity of topography; varying drainage characteristics, etc. at each street to be considered, it is impossible to pre-determine fixed or base rates for all aspects of the necessary work to be accomplished. Total estimated project cost and estimated cost to each abutting property owner will be determined based on the in-the-field inspections of respective streets and current cost of the various segments of construction and related cost at the actual time of consideration by the board of commissioners. Property owners shall be assessed for "actual cost incurred" in providing all the necessary improvements, other than pavement costs. These estimated and approximate cost figures shall be expressed to the petitioners of each respective street when presented to the county board of commissioners for consideration with the acknowledgment of the petitioners.
