Chapter 9 - CURFEW FOR JUVENILES
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 9-1. - Findings; public purpose.
new
(a)
The council hereby finds and determines as a matter of fact that the city is facing a mounting crisis caused by crimes committed by juvenile offenders and crimes committed against juvenile victims.
(b)
The council further finds that persons under the age of 17 are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful activities and/or to place themselves in situations which would increase their potential for victimization.
(c)
The council further finds that a need exists for increased parental responsibility and parental control over the activities of juveniles.
(d)
The council further finds that this criminal activity, both individually and collectively, presents a clear and present danger to the citizenry and to public order and safety and that an ordinance establishing a curfew for persons under the age of 17 and parental responsibility for violations of said curfew is an appropriate method of addressing the foregoing issues.
(e)
Therefore, the purpose of this article is to:
(1)
Protect juveniles themselves and other citizens from the dangers of crimes which occur on sidewalks, streets, and in public and semipublic places during late night and early morning hours;
(2)
Decrease the amount of criminal activity committed by juveniles; and,
(3)
Promote and enhance parental control over juveniles.
