Residential and commercial customers have the option to use up to three 95-gallon plastic containers. All downtown commercial customers who have access to a city-provided dumpster must use the dumpster in their vicinity.

Commercial pickups by means other than dumpsters will be by means of a 95-gallon container provided by the city or its agent. Pickups may be scheduled for twice weekly or five times weekly (Monday through Friday). A monthly fee for residential and commercial accounts will be established by the mayor and council for one primary 95-gallon plastic container and, if requested, an additional charge for two extra 95-gallon containers. The residential or commercial customer cannot have more than three 95-gallon containers registered under one account. Each residential or commercial customer that has a separate electrical or water/sewer account with the city will be considered an individual account. When garbage volume exceeds the need for three 95-gallon containers per account, the residential or commercial customer must provide for private dumpster service.
(d)
The city shall provide at no charge recycling bins for corrugated cardboard boxes in the C-1 business district. Cardboard recycling dumpsters are located at the Pine Street recycling center, downtown alleys, the library and downtown parking lots.
