The annual registration fee and cost of the replacement sign shall be established by mayor and council in the same manner, either by resolution or ordinance, as all other fees and charges are set.

In addition to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a dangerous dog shall present to the dog control officer evidence of:
(1)
A policy of insurance in the amount of at least $15,000.00 issued by an insurer authorized to transact business in this state insuring the owner of the dangerous dog against liability for any personal injuries inflicted by the dangerous dog; or

Issuance of a certificate of registration or the renewal of a certificate of registration by the city does not warrant or guarantee that the requirements specified in subsections (b) and (c) of this section are maintained by the owner of a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog on a continuous basis following the date of the issuance of the initial certificate of registration or following the date of any annual renewal of such certificate.
(g)
A dog control officer is authorized to make whatever inquiry is deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this division.

(h)
The city may charge an annual fee as designated by appropriate resolution or ordinance in similar fashion as the city establishes all other fees and changes, including regular dog licensing fees, to register dangerous dogs and potentially dangerous dogs as required in this section. Certificates of registration shall be renewed on an annual basis. At the time of the annual renewal of a certificate of registration, a dog control officer shall require evidence from the owner or make such investigation as may be necessary to verify that the dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog is continuing to be confined in a proper enclosure and that the owner is continuing to comply with other provisions of this division.
