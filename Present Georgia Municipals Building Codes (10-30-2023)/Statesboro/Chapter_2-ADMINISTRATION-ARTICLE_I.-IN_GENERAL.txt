The absence or unavailability of a designated open records officer shall not delay the city's response to a properly served request.
(Ord. No. 2012-05, § 1, 8-21-12)
Sec. 2-12-3. - Request response.
Upon receipt of a request it shall be the duty of the open records officer to promptly ascertain the availability of all public records responsive to the request and to produce to the requester those records that can be located and produced within a reasonable time, not to exceed three business days of receipt of a request. For purposes of computing the time within which a response must be made, the open records officer shall not count the business day on which a request is received, nor any intervening Saturday, Sunday, or designated holiday on which city offices are closed for general business. Upon intake of a request, the open records officer shall stamp the request with the date and time of receipt, and initial the request. In any instance where records are unavailable within three business days of the request, it shall be the duty of the open records officer to provide the requester with a written description of such records and a timeline for when the records will be available for inspection or copying and to provide the responsive records to the requester as soon thereafter as practicable. Such response shall also contain a good faith estimate of the cost to the requester for the search, retrieval, redaction, and production and copying of records.
(1)
It is the intent that the open records officer be accessible within city hall during the normal hours of general operation of the city's administrative staff, i.e. 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, except on recognized holidays and those days when city hall is closed. The open records officer shall coordinate his or her work schedule with the assistant open records officers to assure coverage within city hall during normal hours at all times when the open records officer is scheduled to be absent or unavailable for extended periods of time. Backup procedures will be implemented by the city clerk to assure such coverage by assistant open records officers during the open records officer's unplanned absence or unavailability.
(2)
Notice of the designation of open records officers shall be posted on the official bulletin board at city hall, in the legal organ of Bulloch County, and on the city's website. In addition, city officers, department managers, and administrative staff shall follow the direction of the open records officer on how to assist and direct persons desiring to request inspection and copying of public records.
(3)
To further assist persons desiring to inspect records, a request form will be available at city hall and on the city's website.
(4)
The open records officer shall confer with every officer or department manager of the city, as necessary, to ascertain the existence of public records responsive to a request (including electronically-stored information), and it shall be the duty of every city officer and department manager to confer with and provide records, or true and correct copies of the originals thereof, to the open records officer promptly, time being of the essence. Upon receipt of a public record responsive to a request, the open records officer shall determine, in consultation with the city attorney, if the record is exempt from disclosure by order of a court of this state or by law; if the record is exempt from disclosure, the written response by the open records officer shall set forth the specific legal authority under which withholding of inspection of the record is claimed. The open records officer shall maintain a log or other documentation of his or her due diligence to comply with a proper request
(Ord. No. 2012-05, § 1, 8-21-12)
Sec. 2-12-4. - Fees.
The open records officer shall further have the duty to collect from a requester a reasonable charge for the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of records, utilizing the most economical means available to identify and produce non-excluded records. The charge for the search, retrieval, or redaction of records shall not exceed the prorated hourly salary of the lowest paid full-time employee who, in the reasonable discretion of the open records officer, has the necessary skill and training to perform the request; provided, however, no charge shall be made for the first quarter hour. In addition thereto, where certified copies of specific records are sought, the fees for certified copies prescribed by law shall apply; otherwise, a fee for the copying of records shall not exceed $0.10 per page for letter or legal size documents or, in the case of other documents and electronic records, the actual cost of reproducing the document or media on which the records or media are produced. It shall be the right of the requester, at the time of inspection, to make photographic copies or other electronic reproductions of records, at his or her own expense, using suitable portable devices brought to the place of inspection. Whenever any person has requested to inspect and copy public records and received a written response estimating the cost of the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of the records responsive to the request, and the city has actually incurred such costs but the requester fails to inspect or accept copies of the records, the open records officer shall be authorized to collect such charges in any manner authorized by law.
In any instance in which the open records officer has estimated costs in excess of $25.00 for responding to a request, the open records officer may defer the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of the records until the requester has stated, in writing, his or her willingness to pay an amount equal to the estimate of costs. In any instance in which the estimated costs exceed $500.00, the open records officer shall insist, in writing, upon prepayment of the estimated costs prior to beginning search, retrieval, redaction, production or copying of the records. In any instance in which a requester has outstanding costs owing to the city for a previous records request, the open records officer shall insist upon prepayment of the outstanding costs and estimated costs prior to beginning search and retrieval.
(Ord. No. 2012-05, § 1, 8-21-12)
Sec. 2-12-5. - Litigation.
Requests by civil litigants, or their counsel of record, in any ongoing civil action or administrative proceeding shall be made in writing and shall include the style of the action or proceeding, the names and addresses of all parties and, if a party is represented by counsel, the name, address, and telephone number of the party's attorney; a copy of the request shall be served by the requester upon all parties or their counsel of record in the action or proceeding contemporaneous to filing the written request with the open records officer. The open records officer shall make duplicate set(s) of records provided in response to the request available to all parties or their counsel for the cost of copies only, unless a party or its counsel elects not to receive the records and pay the copying charge. If the city is a party to the action or proceeding, a set of responses shall be provided to counsel for the city at no charge.
(Ord. No. 2012-05, § 1, 8-21-12)
Sec. 2-12-6. - Training.
The open records officer and assistant open records officer(s) shall, prior to assuming the duties of their office, undergo a course of training in public records management and specifically compliance with the Georgia Open Records Law, O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq., as approved by the city attorney. It shall be the responsibility of the city clerk, at least annually, to conduct a workshop for city officers and department managers on the minimum requirements and procedures for public records management and open records disclosure, including the penalties or civil fines that may be imposed for violating Georgia's public records laws.
