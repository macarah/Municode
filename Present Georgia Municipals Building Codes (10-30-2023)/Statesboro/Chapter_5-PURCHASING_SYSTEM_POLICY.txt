Sec. 5-317. - Sealed bid process.
(a)
This process must be used for any purchase that is for $20,000.00 or more, unless one of the special procurement methods applies. This process requires the advertisement twice in the local newspaper in which sheriff's sales are advertised, spaced seven days apart, with the first advertisement printed at least 14 days before the date of the bid opening.

(Ord. No. 2011-09, 11-1-11)
Sec. 5-319. - Open purchase order process.
Department heads may request that the city manager authorize the issuance of an open purchase order for a specified vendor, for a specified period not to exceed a month, with a maximum dollar figure attached.

(Ord. No. 2011-09, 11-1-11)
Sec. 5-320. - Georgia local government public works construction law projects.
(a)
This process shall be used by the city in order to comply with state law. The O.C.G.A. §§ 36-91-1 through 36-91-95, or as subsequently amended, requires cities that engage in the building, altering, repairing, improving, or demolishing of any public structure or building or other public improvements of any kind to any public real property other than those projects covered by O.C.G.A. Chapter 4 of Title 32 (see section 5-321 below) in which the value of said work is $100,000.00 or more, to use the competitive bid or proposal processes set out in these statutory provisions, unless the proposed work qualifies for one of the limited exceptions. This statute does not apply to the routine operation, repair, or maintenance of existing structures, buildings, or real property.
For public works projects under $20,000.00, competitive written quotes and proposals, per city policy, shall be obtained and presented to the city manager for approval. For projects costing $20,000.00 to $100,000.00 competitive written quotes shall be obtained and submitted to council for approval. Although there is no required sealed bid/proposal process per House Bill 1079 for projects with a cost of $100,000.00 or less, complete and detailed documentation of obtained written quotes shall be provided and kept in the central services division. The central services division shall be involved in every stage of the process in obtaining competitive written quotes. Vendors shall submit written quotes to the central services division by the determined due date and time. Although many formalities are not required for projects with a cost of $100,000.00 or less, vendors will be given a due date and time for written quotes and the quotes shall be in a sealed envelope at the time of submittal to the central services division.
(b)
The preferred construction delivery method for these projects is the "design, bid, build" method. No other method allowed by state law shall be used unless expressly approved by the mayor and city council. No project requiring a contract under this method shall begin the design phase without the express approval of the city manager, even if it has been included in the annual capital budget, so that its methods of financing, design, advertisement, and award have been thoroughly reviewed.
(Ord. No. 2011-09, 11-1-11)
Sec. 5-321. - Georgia municipal street projects.
(a)
This process shall be used by the city in order to comply with state law. The O.C.G.A. §§ 32-4-90 through 32-4-123, or as subsequently amended, requires cities that engage in a contract valued at $20,000.00 or more for the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of all or part of a public road in said municipality, including but not limited to a contract or subcontract for the purchase of materials, for the hiring of labor, for professional services, or for other things or services incident to such work, to use the competitive bid process set out in these statutory provisions, unless the proposed work qualifies for one of the limited exceptions. If the professional service design phase stands alone and is not part of a complete project package that contains a construction and management element, the requirements for obtaining professional services for street projects shall fall under the general provisions of the professional service guidelines contained in House Bill 1079.
(b)
No project requiring a contract under this method shall begin the design phase without the express approval of the city manager, even if it has been included in the annual capital budget, so that its methods of financing, design, advertisement, and award have been thoroughly reviewed.
(Ord. No. 2011-09, 11-1-11)
Sec. 5-322. - Sole source purchases.
The city manager shall be authorized to designate a sole source for any item or service under $20,000.00 in value, the purchase of which, due to special scientific, technological, or extraordinary specifications and circumstances such as but not limited to standardization, is available from only one vendor. Any such purchase shall be documented as to the reasons for the sole source and shall be maintained in the office of the central services division. Any proposed sole source purchase that is $20,000.00 or more in value must be approved by the mayor and city council.
(Ord. No. 2011-09, 11-1-11)
Sec. 5-323. - Emergency purchases.
The city manager is authorized to waive any or all bidding requirements for the purchase of necessary goods or services whenever an emergency condition exists which presents a threat to the safety, health and welfare of the citizens of the city and whenever such requirements would cause undue delay in the delivery of essential services under such conditions. Any emergency purchases must be reported to the mayor and city council at the next regular meeting of the city council.
(Ord. No. 2011-09, 11-1-11)
Sec. 5-324. - Professional services.
Professional services, as defined in subsection 5-302(2) of this Municipal Code, may be required on a project basis, for specific activities or for certain durations of time. Procurement of these services shall be the primary responsibility of the user agency with the assistance of the central services director. After a firm is selected, approval from the city manager must be obtained for services costing less than $20,000.00. For services with a cost of $20,000.00 and higher, it shall be required to obtain the approval of council prior to the contract being awarded. This process shall comply with O.C.G.A. § 36-91-22 and House Bill 1079. This shall apply to public works projects as well as municipal street projects in the area of professional services which are exempt from competitive processes per House Bill 1079. As stated in House Bill 1079, this shall be for stand-alone professional services and shall not be included in an all-encompassing construction project where design, construction and project management are contained in one bid package per House Bill 1079. However, this does not prohibit the usage of a competitive proposal process if it is deemed to be beneficial.
