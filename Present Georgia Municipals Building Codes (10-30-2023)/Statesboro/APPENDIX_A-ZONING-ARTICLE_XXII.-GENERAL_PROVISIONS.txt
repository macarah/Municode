ARTICLE XXII. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 2200. - Effect of private covenants.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to render inoperative any enforceable restriction established by covenants running with the land, and which restrictions are not prohibited by or not contrary to the regulations herein established.
Section 2201. - Lots of record.
A.
Single lots. Where the owner of a lot in an R-3, R-15, or R-20 district at the time of the adoption of this ordinance or his successor in title thereto does not own sufficient land to enable him to conform to the dimensional requirements of this ordinance, such lot may be used as a building site for a single-family residence.
B.
Adjoining lots. If two or more adjoining lots with continuous frontage are in a single ownership at any time after the adoption of this ordinance and such lots individually are too small to meet the yard, width, and area requirements of the district in which they are located, such groups of lots shall be considered as a single lot or several lots of minimum permitted size and the lot or lots in one ownership shall be subject to the requirements of this ordinance.
C.
Exemption. Any land that has been platted and accepted by the city will be exempted from lot size requirements.
(Ord. of 9-17-91; Amd. of 12-4-01(3), § 9)
Section 2202. - Reduction of lot area.
No lot, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced in size so that the lot width or depth, front, side, or rear yard, lot area per family, or other requirements of this ordinance are not maintained. This section shall not apply when a portion of a lot is acquired for public purposes.
(Ord. of 9-17-91)
Section 2203. - [Yards and frontage.]
A.
Principal building and frontage. Only one principal building and its customary accessory buildings may hereafter be erected on any lot. More than one multiple dwelling or institutional, commercial, or industrial building may be located upon a lot or tract in districts other than R-3, R-15 or R-20, but such buildings shall not encroach upon the front, side, and rear yards required by the district regulations, and for multiple dwellings the open space between buildings measured at the closest point shall not be less than 20 feet for one-story buildings and 30 feet when one or both are two-story buildings. No principal building shall be controlled or erected on any lot which does not have immediate frontage or an open and dedicated public street or road of not less than 50 feet.
B.
Yard service to one building. No part of a yard, or other open space, of [or] offstreet parking or loading space required about, or in connection with, any building, for the purpose of complying with this ordinance, shall be included as part of a yard, open space, or offstreet parking or loading place similarly required for any other building.
C.
Modification of front yard requirements. Where an unimproved lot of record is situate on the same street frontage with two improved lots or one unimproved and one improved lot, the front yard requirement for that district may be modified so that the front yard shall be an average of the existing and as required front yard.

Section 2203.3. - Parking and storage of certain vehicles in residential zones prohibited.
In districts zoned for residential use, no person shall park or store any vehicle over 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or 24 feet in length except for the purpose of loading or unloading such vehicle. The loading or unloading of such vehicle shall be done within a reasonable time but not to exceed 48 hours. No truck body, trailer, or truck tractor, or part thereof may be parked or stored within the districts herein described unless specifically authorized by this ordinance. Recreational vehicles, motor homes, campers, boat trailers, and similar vehicles used solely for noncommercial or personal recreation use shall not come within this prohibition if such vehicle is parked or stored within a garage or enclosed area, or within the rear yard of a lot not closer than five feet to any lot line.
(Ord. of 9-17-91)
Section 2204. - Vision clearance at corners, curb cuts, and railroad crossings.
Notwithstanding any part of this ordinance or any permit granted or any variance granted by the board of appeals, no type of structure, vehicle, tree, plant, vegetation, sign or fence, or any type of obstacle or any portion thereof shall be placed or retained in such a manner which would create a traffic hazard or would obstruct the vision clearance of corners, curb cuts, or railroad crossings in any zone.
Section 2205. - Unsightly or unsanitary storage.
No rubbish, salvage materials, junk, or miscellaneous refuse shall be openly stored or kept in the open and no weeds shall be allowed to go uncut within any zones when the same may be construed to be a menace to public health and safety or to have a depressing influence upon property values in the area.
Section 2205.1. - Screening of junkyards.
Certain uses such as junk or salvage yard operations and other commercial and industrial operations requiring the storage of inoperative equipment or vehicles for prolonged periods of time could present unsightly views or health hazards. To preclude this from occurring, owners of such properties shall completely enclose such operations by a fence with completely obscured views of the property from adjacent sidewalks and streets, built to a height greater than that of the height of the highest piece of equipment or vehicle stored on the property provided that no fence shall be less than three feet nor more than 20 feet in height when measured from the crown of the adjacent street(s). Such fences shall be constructed of solid materials. Construction of cyclone fencing which utilizes metal inserts as screening shall be prohibited. Fencing along street frontages shall be located no closer than 90 feet from the centerline of the adjacent street.
Many operations which involve the stacking of inoperative or obsolete equipment or vehicles pose a direct health hazard to the public. All such operations are subject to an annual inspection by the Bulloch County Health Department. The results of any such inspections shall be delivered to the zoning enforcement officer for review. If a business fails to pass such inspection it shall have 30 days to comply or it shall cease operations until such time that compliance is effected.
All uses listed herein shall be operated in strict conformance with the following regulations:
1.
The minimum land area for a junk salvage yard shall be five acres; provided further that the mayor and city council upon recommendation of the zoning administrator may authorize a licensed automobile salvage yard to maintain less area if all other provisions of the zoning ordinance are observed and a smaller area would best serve the public interest; provided however, that in no case will an automobile yard contain less than one acre.
2.
No automobile salvage yard or used parts dealer shall store more than 50 automobile bodies per net storage acre. For the purpose of enforcing this ordinance a "net storage acre" is 75 percent of an acre; provided that the formula for determining maximum storage density to individual automobile salvage yards is:
A × .75 × 50 (automobile bodies)
A = Total contingent acreage
3.
All junkyards, salvage yards, and related uses shall be located on well-drained areas; provided that no drainage channel or watercourse shall traverse storage and dismantling operation areas.
(Ord. of 9-17-91)
Section 2206. - Public utilities.
The provisions of this ordinance shall not be so constructed as to limit or interfere with the installation, operation, and maintenance of public utility structures or facilities in existence at the time of passage of this ordinance, or which may hereafter be located within public easements or rights-of-way designated for such purposes.
Section 2207. - Annexation-deannexation.
In the event of changes in the city limits removing territory from the city, district boundaries shall be construed as moving with city limits. In the event of annexation of new areas to the city, such areas shall be considered to be in the R-40 district until otherwise classified.
(Amd. of 12-4-01(3), § 9)
Section 2208. - Administrative standards.
Whenever, in the course of administration and enforcement of this ordinance, it is necessary or desirable to make any administrative decision, then, unless other standards are in this ordinance provided, the decision shall be made so that the result will not be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this ordinance.
Section 2209. - Swimming pools and screen enclosures.
A.
Private swimming pools. A private swimming pool shall be allowed in any residential zoning district, and on any lot used principally as a single-family, duplex or multifamily dwelling, as an accessory use only if it fully complies with the following standards:
1.
The swimming pool shall be used solely for the enjoyment of the occupants of the principal use on the property or their guests.
2.
The swimming pool, including any surrounding patio, decking, etc., shall be located no closer than ten feet from any property line, provided, however, that it shall not be located in any front yard.
3.
The swimming pool shall not be constructed on a lot prior to the time of construction of the principal building to which it is accessory.
B.
Screen enclosures. A screen enclosure constructed around and over a swimming pool shall be considered an accessory structure, whether detached or attached to the principal building. Screen enclosures which are utilized to enclose swimming pools shall not be restricted as to square footage, except that they shall be only of adequate size to envelope the pool and surrounding patio, decking, etc. Screen enclosures shall further comply with the following standards:
1.
In no case shall a screened enclosure exceed 25 feet in height, or a height equivalent to the peak of the principal building on the lot, whichever is less.
2.
Screen enclosures shall not be located within the front yard, and shall not be within ten feet of any property line.
