If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling, building or structure can be made at reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or

The use or occupancy of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(f)

The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid.
(h)
The city may enforce its lien in the following manner:

Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this chapter, the city manager or his or her designee shall transmit to the city clerk a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notice of lis pendens provided to interested parties.

It shall be the duty of the city revenue officer who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply.
(2)
Enforcement of liens pursuant to this chapter may be initiated at any time following receipt by the city clerk of the final determination of costs in accordance with this chapter.

(3)
The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this chapter shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this chapter together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority, county tax commissioner, or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien.

(b)
Any fine or penalty imposed under this section may be imposed by the court hearing the case on his own motion at the hearing or as the result of a motion and hearing for such purpose brought by a party to such proceedings. Until paid, any such fine or penalty so imposed shall also constitute a lien against the property which is the subject of the proceedings in favor of the city, and notice of such lien shall be given by the recording of the order in the office of the city clerk on a lien docket maintained for such purposes and in the deed records of the clerk of the Superior Court of Bulloch County.

DIVISION 2. - DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS

Sec. 38-91. - Applicability.
The policies, design principles and standards set out in this division in regard to grading, soil erosion and sedimentation control and drainage shall be incorporated in the plans and conduct of any development, excavation, construction or land-disturbing activity within the city, and incorporated into site plans submitted to the city engineer in applying for a permit under this article.
(Ord. of 6-18-96(1))
Sec. 38-92. - Grading.
Grading of development, construction or land-disturbing activity shall be conducted in a manner that:
(1)
Encourages the design of grading plans to provide natural appearance of land contours and to provide ease of use in public areas.
(2)
Minimizes the adverse effect of land clearance and grading upon existing vegetation.
(3)
Minimizes the adverse effects of land clearance and grading upon the drainage system by strict erosion control and sedimentation and control devices and alteration of natural or established drainage patterns.
(Ord. of 6-18-96(1))
Sec. 38-93. - Drainage.
(a)
Design principles. Development, excavation, construction or land-disturbing activity shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the following principles:
(1)
Maintaining, where feasible, the natural environment of city streams or drainageways through reduction of flow quantities resulting from new development and, where feasible, restoring the floodplain to its natural functional purpose to resolve existing flooding problems, but recognizing the necessity of using urban streams for stormwater runoff in those situations where maintenance of the natural stream environment would result in continuation or worsening of flooding conditions.
(2)
Encouraging innovative design solutions to the effective detention/retention and reduction of runoff. Drainage control measures to retain, reduce and regulate the rate of stormwater discharge shall include but need not be limited to retention or detention ponds, percolation facilities, parking lots, open space areas, and oversized storm drains with restricted outlets. In addition, the city encourages the development of retention facilities in such a manner that they will become aesthetically and recreationally beneficial to the community in which they are located.
(b)
Design and maintenance standards. All development, construction and land-disturbing activities shall be conducted in compliance with the following standards:
(1)
All engineering design items for storm drainage and delineation of the 100-year floodplain shall meet the applicable minimum requirements available from the city engineer. Rainfall intensities used in hydrologic computations shall not be less than shown by applicable rainfall curves published by the National Weather Service for the affected area.
(2)
A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all developments and construction which will increase the peak rate of runoff from the site by more than one cubic foot per second (cfs) for a 10-year frequency storm of 24-hour duration; however, this shall not apply to those activities specifically exempted in section 38-70.
(3)
The release rate of stormwater from all developments where retention or detention is required shall not exceed the peak stormwater runoff rate from the area in its existing state from all intensities up to and including the 25-year frequency for a 24-hour storm.
(4)
The drainage system being developed shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of 25-year design frequency, except for areas considered to be major drainage canals. The major drainage canals shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of 100-year frequency.
(5)
Land uses within the 100-year floodplain shall not diminish or restrict the capacity of the channels or floodplains of the stream or its tributaries, drainage ditches or any other drainage facilities or systems, and shall not increase the 100-year elevation or velocity or concentration of flow in downstream areas. If the required hydrologic studies reveal that a request for filling or grading within the 100-year floodplain would overload the capacity of the channel downstream or increase flood stages upstream, the development permit shall be denied unless equivalent flow and storage capacity is replaced and maintained by the owner within the 100-year floodplain. Altered sections of the 100-year floodplain shall have a positive slope so as to provide positive drainage back to the stream flow line, and these sections must be maintained by the owners in perpetuity so as to prevent or remove silt buildup.
(6)
The live detention/retention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the basis of the 25-year frequency rainfall as published by the National Weather Service for the affected areas. The detention/retention system required shall be that necessary to handle the runoff for all storm frequencies up to and including 25-year, 24-hour storm. Detention/retention control structures and other drainage improvements shall be located and designed to prevent erosion damage to adjacent property owners. Retention or detention control structures shall be sized for the release rate as presented in this section, and will have provisions for overflow of the 50-year and 100-year storms without damage to the structure.
(7)
When the developer requests and the city engineer determines that development and construction projects are too small, or that engineering and economic factors make combined detention/retention or other drainage facilities more practical, the city may authorize the joint construction of these facilities to serve two or more properties by two or more developers. This authorization shall be granted by the city engineer. Where joint detention/retention facilities serving two or more properties are approved for construction, no use of land or occupancy of buildings within the properties served by these facilities shall be permitted until completion of the detention/retention facility, except upon approval of the city administrator.
(8)
When adequacy of existing drainage structures is being considered in association with proposed development, the overall capacity of the structure will be evaluated and divided among upstream properties. The available capacity will be divided among property owners based on acreage in the basin. Under no condition will the available capacity of the structure be exceeded. Should the developer desire to replace the structure in lieu of retention or detention, all downstream structures should be evaluated and deemed adequate.
(9)
The following requirements shall apply to the installation, development and maintenance of all retention, detention and sedimentation control facilities designed for storage of stormwater runoff:
a.
These facilities shall be located on tracts of land designated for this use on the recorded plat, with sufficient area around the perimeter to provide access for maintenance purposes. The access easement shall provide at least 20 feet of width outside of aboveground obstructions, including trees, headwalls, wires and settling basins or other drainage structures.
b.
Perforated standpipes or a french drain, as approved by the city engineer, or other methods which will achieve equal performance to prevent standing of water and inadequate drainage, shall be installed within all these facilities.
c.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of these detention/retention facilities during grading and construction and following final approval of the completed project. This maintenance obligation shall be binding on future owners, successors and assigns of the property.
d.
In the case of single-family residential subdivisions approved after the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives, the city shall assume maintenance responsibility two years after the release of subdivision streets. A special drainage district as authorized by 1972 Ga. Laws, page 1552, is established for property in a single-family residential subdivision at the time the plat is finally recorded, and will be so noted on the plat. Upon completion of developer maintenance, all detention ponds shall have a positive slope to the outlet in order to facilitate complete drainage. Detention/retention facilities shall be designed so that they are safe and where possible restrict access to the public.
e.
Those facilities in single-family residential subdivisions constructed under permits issued prior to the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives will not be accepted for city maintenance unless such facilities are individually approved by and at the discretion of the city council and suitable access easements are provided. At the time the city council accepts a detention/retention facility for city maintenance, a special drainage district may be established that includes all properties for which the detention/retention facility is designed to compensate for increased peak runoff rates due to development.
f.
Pursuant to the creation of special drainage districts by the city as authorized by 1972 Ga. Laws, page 1552, revenues to fund city detention/retention facilities maintenance may be obtained by an ad valorem tax on all properties for which the retention facilities are designed to compensate for increased peak runoff rates due to development. Such ad valorem millage rates may be set annually by the city council when other ad valorem millage rates are set. No assessment will be made in a special drainage district in the calendar year in which it is established.
(10)
All buildings located adjacent to or in the 100-year floodplain shall be constructed in accordance with chapter 46, pertaining to flood damage prevention.
(11)
Special drainage system maintenance requirements are as follows:
a.
No impoundment of water which retains in excess of 0.5 acre-feet of runoff shall be removed without first obtaining a development permit, which shall only be issued after competent engineering studies provided by the developer show that this removal will not adversely affect downstream properties.
b.
Trash, garbage, construction materials, construction byproducts or other debris shall not be deposited in any part of the drainage system.
c.
No restrictions or barriers, including fences, may be placed in the drainage system without first obtaining a development permit. When onsite or offsite debris has accumulated within a floodplain in such a manner as to interfere with the free flow of water so as to increase the risk of hazardous inundation of upstream properties adjacent to the floodplain, the public works director shall require the owner of the property where this debris was generated, if its source can be identified, to clear and remove the debris so as to permit the free flow of water.
(12)
All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
(13)
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharges from the systems into drainageways.
(14)
Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
(15)
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

Sec. 38-124. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 38-124(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections 38-124(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 38-124(b)(2) of this article;
(15)
Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any pehemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an pehemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 38-124(b) and (c) of this article.
(e)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
(Ord. No. 2010-15, 7-7-10)

ARTICLE VII. - COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM

Sec. 38-160. - Purpose.
The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services.
In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, the mayor and council in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations at Chapter 61, Urban Redevelopment, of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread.
In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.
