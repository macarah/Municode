Sec. 80-56. - Mandatory subcontracting projects.
The department of central services, may designate certain procurement projects or contracts as requiring a certain number or percentage of subcontracting opportunities (wherein all subcontractors perform a commercially useful function). The "mandatory subcontracting" designation for a particular project is discretionary on the part of the department of central services and should be applied only where there is a reasonable expectation, based on the various components of the project and subcontractor availability, that there will be a sufficient number of subcontracting firms ready, willing, and able to do the assigned work.

In the event there are two local MFBE vendors within six percent, the local MFBE vendor with the lowest quote or bid submittal shall have the first opportunity to match the out-of-county and or non MFBE vendor's quote or bid. If the lowest local MFBE vendor declines, the opportunity shall be offered to the next local MFBE vendor providing their bid is within the six percent range. This applies to purchases in the range of $1,000.01 and up. When public works and/or street projects are involved, this policy shall not contradict state law regarding mandated procedures for these processes.
