Fees for excessive false alarms. Any person who owns or occupies a building or lot upon which is located a private alarm system which experiences excessive false alarms, as defined above, shall be assessed a fee by the city for each false alarm over and above those defined as excessive in the amount set forth in the schedule of fees and charges.
