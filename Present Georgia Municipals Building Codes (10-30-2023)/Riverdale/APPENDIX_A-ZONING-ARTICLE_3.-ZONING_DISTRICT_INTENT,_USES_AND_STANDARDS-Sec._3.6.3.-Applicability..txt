Sec. 3.6.3. - Applicability.
These standards apply to all proposed development within the TCMU district that is subject to site plan approval. Development within the TCMU district is also subject to the architectural design standards set forth in article 5, Architectural Design Standards. Planning commission, at its discretion, may ap-prove minor deviations from the design standards if, in the opinion of the commission, such deviations contribute to the principles articulated in section 3.5.2 more effectively than strict compliance with specific standards. Applicants shall clarify how proposed deviations advance the goals of the town center as defined by the guiding principles. These design standards do not exempt applicants from obtaining all required permits and complying with all applicable building codes, laws, and regulations in force.
