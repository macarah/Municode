Sec. 3.3.3.1. - Purpose.
The O-I district is a typical office-institutional district that should be promoted by Riverdale as a source of high paying jobs. As with the majority of zoning districts in the ordinance, the O-I is an exclusive district, prohibiting low density residential development that could compete with office development in a market where vacant land is limited. Given that reality, development standards that foster high intensity development, in combination with the reservation of open space, are intended to create park-like settings that will attract and sustain office tenants and employees. Institutional uses such as places of worship and schools of all types are also allowed in the O-I District. Buffers and setbacks can facilitate an appropriate transition from office and institutional uses to either neighborhood commercial districts or multifamily districts that would be appropriate uses to step down from O-I District uses to single-family detached neighborhoods.
