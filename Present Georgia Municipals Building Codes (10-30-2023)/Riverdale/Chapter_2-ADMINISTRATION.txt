The mayor is the presiding officer for city council meetings unless absent in which case, the mayor pro tem shall preside. Council members are not permitted to call out or interrupt another speaker. The order in which members of the governing body are to be recognized for the purpose of addressing or speaking to any particular issue or subject matter shall be determined by the presiding officer in his or her discretion, provided that the presiding officer shall not be entitled to prohibit a member of the governing body from speaking regarding each issue or matter under discussion, for up to a total of three minutes for each issue or matter. The only manner in which any member of the governing body may be recognized by the presiding officer for the purpose of speaking during a meeting is to first raise a hand and be recognized by the presiding officer, in accordance with this subsection.
(b)
When making remarks at a meeting, each member of the governing body shall confine his or her remarks to the topic being discussed or debated, and shall avoid personal attacks upon other members of the governing body or upon the motives or character of other members.

(d)
A second is required for any motion to assure minimum support for the motion.
(e)
When a second is not forthcoming, the motion will "die for lack of a second," and the presiding officer shall so announce. Then the next order of business will be taken up without further debate or discussion.
(f)
The presiding officer has the right to rule remarks or comments out of order and thereby terminate them, if a council member has already made essentially the same point, or if the council member is repeating something he or she has already stated. The purpose of this rule is to avoid redundancies and repeating the same point more than once, and to avoid wasting time during debate and discussion.
(g)
No council member shall be allowed to speak on any one topic for more than a total of five minutes during any single meeting.
(h)
This section shall not affect the time limits set forth in the city's zoning ordinance.

(a)
A member of the city council may raise a "point of inquiry" if a simple clarification of a motion (a motion that is already before the council for consideration) is needed. This should be done by raising a hand and stating to the presiding officer, "point of inquiry," and at that time the presiding officer may in his or her discretion, recognize the council member by stating "state your point."
(b)
Points of inquiry are used sparingly and only in case of honest confusion as to the intent or meaning of a then pending motion. A point of inquiry may not be used to simply add to the debate or discussion.
(c)
Clarification cannot take longer than three minutes.
( Ord. No. 06-2015 , § 1, 8-10-15)
Sec. 2-33. - Point of order.
(a)
A council member may interrupt a speaker in order to raise a "point of order," if the council member reasonably believes a meeting is being conducted in a manner inconsistent with these rules or Robert's Rules of Order.
(b)
If a point of order is properly raised by the council member being recognized by the presiding officer to speak, then the council member who was speaking will upon request of the presiding officer yield the floor for the limited purpose of hearing the point of order.
(c)
The mayor would then say "state your point" and the point of order will be handled in accordance with Robert's Rules of Order.
( Ord. No. 06-2015 , § 1, 8-10-15)

(b)
Public comments will be limited in time to a total of three minutes per speaker, and a total time limit at any one meeting of 15 minutes. If more than five potential speakers sign up to make public comments, then the total amount of time permitted for each individual speaker will be reduced by an announcement of the presiding officer, so as to limit the total time to 15 minutes.
(c)
No person may sign up more than once in an effort to gain more time for a public comment.
(d)
Public comments during a meeting of the city governing body will only be allowed to residents of the City of Riverdale or to owners of businesses maintaining a business site physically situated within the corporate limits of the City of Riverdale.
(e)
Persons not residing within the City of Riverdale who do not own a business as specified in subsection (d) above who wish to address the governing body during any regular meeting must first request that they be placed on the agenda for the upcoming regular meeting, such request to be made in writing by close of business at city hall on the Wednesday immediately preceding the regular meeting at which they wish to speak.
(f)
All public comments must be limited to matters on the agenda or over which the governing body has jurisdiction.
(g)
Nonresidents who do not own a business as specified in subsection (d) above will also be limited to three minutes per speaker, and a total of 15 minutes for an entire group of speakers at any single meeting, whether they are speaking on the same topic or not. If more than five potential nonresident speakers are placed on the agenda in order to address the governing body, the time permitted for each individual speaker shall be reduced so as to limit the total time for speaking for such nonresidents to 15 minutes at any one meeting.
( Ord. No. 06-2015 , § 1, 8-10-15)
Sec. 2-35. - Addressing the city council and citizens.
(a)
Speakers may raise any point of concern regarding any matter on the agenda or any matter over which the governing body has jurisdiction, but each speaker must maintain a decorous demeanor and refrain from personal attacks upon members of the governing body, shouting and using obscene language.
(b)
The presiding officer may interrupt and take the floor away from individuals who violate subsection (a) above.
(c)
Comments which are redundant or repetitive from previous statements made in the same meeting may be ruled out of order and terminated by the presiding officer.
( Ord. No. 06-2015 , § 1, 8-10-15)
Sec. 2-36. - Removal for violation of these rules.
Any council member who violates these rules must first be orally warned by the presiding officer, and if the council member then interrupts another speaker or speaks out without being recognized, or violates these rules in any other way for a second time in a single meeting, then the presiding officer may ask the sergeant at arms (a sworn City of Riverdale Police Officer) to remove the offending council member from the city council chambers for the remainder of the meeting.
( Ord. No. 06-2015 , § 1, 8-10-15)
Sec. 2-37. - Purpose of these rules.
It is not the intent of these rules to in any way hinder or impair the full and free expression of all competing viewpoints in discussions and debates. Instead it is the intent of this section to foster confidence in government through encouraging civil and respectful meetings. The failure to strictly observe these rules and procedures shall not affect the jurisdiction of the governing body and shall not be deemed to in any way invalidate or impair the legal validity and effect of official action taken by the governing body at any meeting that is otherwise held and conducted in accordance with law.
