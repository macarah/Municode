(b)
Pursuant to the City Charter, sections 47 and 58, the council has the authority and now chooses to exercise that authority to regulate animal control in the City of Riverdale.

It must be maintained clean, dry and compatible with current weather conditions, in addition to age, size, species and condition of the animal. The structure must be of sufficient size to allow the animal to stand, turn around, lie down and go in and out of the structure comfortably. To be adequate, some type of bedding that is quick drying, such as hay or pine straw, must be provided to maintain comfortable temperatures within the structure during times when the ambient, outside temperature is below freezing. In addition, the structure shall include a heavy plastic or rubber flap to cover the door and/or window openings during the months of November through March. From April through October, the structure shall either be shaded or moved out of direct sunlight. If the shelter is made of wood, it shall be raised at least two inches off the ground to prevent seepage or rotting.
