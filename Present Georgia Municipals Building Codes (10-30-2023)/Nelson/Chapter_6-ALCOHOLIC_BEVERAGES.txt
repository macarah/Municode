Sec. 6-144. - Suspension and revocation.
(a)
Grounds. It shall constitute grounds for the suspension and revocation of any license issued under this division that the licensee no longer meets the qualifications required of an initial applicant, or has violated other restrictions or regulations applicable to a licensee and contained in this article. The violation of any state or federal law applicable to the possession or sale of beer and wine shall also constitute grounds for suspension and revocation.

Upon discovery of any violation authorizing a suspension or revocation of a license under this division, or upon the receipt of an affidavit from any citizen alleging such a violation, the mayor shall decide whether the license in question should be suspended pending the completion of investigation and the provision of a hearing for the licensee concerning the proposed revocation. Should the mayor elect to suspend the license for good cause shown, he may do so, and shall have notice of such suspension and the hearing date served upon the licensee or the agent in charge at the license location by the city police chief.
(c)
Appeal. A licensee whose license has been suspended may appeal to the mayor and council for a hearing if he wishes to further contest the accuracy of the findings upon which the suspension was grounded. The decision of the majority of the mayor and council as to the disputed grounds shall be binding in any further proceeding on the proposed revocation. If any of the grounds for suspension is upheld by the council on appeal, the license shall stand revoked; it shall otherwise be reinstated.
