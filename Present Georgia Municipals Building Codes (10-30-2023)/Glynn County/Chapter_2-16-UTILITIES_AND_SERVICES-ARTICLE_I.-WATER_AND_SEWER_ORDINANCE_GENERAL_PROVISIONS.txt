(a)
Water Conservation. All irrigation systems shall be designed, installed, maintained, altered, repaired, serviced, and operated in a manner that shall prevent the waste of water, promotes the most efficient use of water, and applies the least amount of water that is required to maintain healthy individual plant material or turf and control erosion.
(b)
Definitions. As used in this Section the following words shall mean:
(1)
Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, gasses, or other substances into the distribution pipes of the Utility's potable supply of water from any source or sources.
(2)
Backflow Prevention Assembly means an assembly used to prevent backflow into the Utility's potable water system. The type of assembly used should be based on the degree of hazard or pollution which may impair or have an adverse effect on the quality of potable water.

(1)
Notwithstanding any provision in this Section to the contrary, the Utility may enter into private contracts with developers consistent with provisions of O.C.G.A. § 36-71-13(b) to construct system improvements that benefit the water or sewer systems as a whole as well as the developer involved. Contracts involve financial participation of the developer. The degree of benefit to the Utility and developer shall be evaluated by the Director based on facts available at the time and applicable capital improvement plans of the Utility. The evaluation shall identify capacities created and shall fix the percentage of participation by the developer as his proportionate share of development.
(2)
Contracts should be standardized to the extent circumstances and special conditions pertaining to systems improvement will permit. This standardization does not pertain to the capacity evaluation by the Director that identifies the developer's proportionate share.
(3)
Costs of required land, other than street rights-of-way and easements, shall be considered as part of the improvement cost. If the land required is within the development, however, its value shall be based on cost to the developer of the unimproved acreage of the planned development.
(4)
The contract may specify reimbursement to the developer from Capital Tapping Fees generated in the area benefitting from the improvement to the extent of developers financial participation that is in excess of the amount specified in the contract as the developer's proportionate share. A map delineating the area of improvement shall be prepared and attached to the contract. Reimbursement shall not exceed the dollar amount of such developer's participation in cost.
(5)
Expenditures and costs which may be eligible for reimbursement of proportionate share of development: Construction of water production facilities, wastewater pollution control plants, wastewater lift stations, water distribution and sewer collection infrastructure; engineering pertaining to such construction; survey and legal costs pertaining to the improvements, and land required for system improvements.
(6)
The contract may require, at developer's expense, a guarantee of performance by irrevocable letter of credit or other guarantee acceptable to the Utility's Attorney.
(7)
Project improvements solely benefitting the developer are not eligible for Utility participation. Such improvements shall be constructed at the developer's or owner's expense in accordance with the County's "Standard Construction Practices for Water and Sewer Improvement" or as such document is superceded by the Utility's "Water and Sewer Design and Construction Standards and Specifications."
