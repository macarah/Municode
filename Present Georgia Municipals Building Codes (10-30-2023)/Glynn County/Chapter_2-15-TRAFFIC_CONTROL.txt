ARTICLE III. - PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION VEHICLE ORDINANCE

2-15-60 - Short Title.
This Ordinance shall be known as the "Glynn County Personal Transportation Vehicle Ordinance."
( Ord. No. O-2019-04 , 7/18/2019)
2-15-61 - Findings and Intent.
This Ordinance is adopted in the interest of public safety. Personal transportation vehicles, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles, while not designed or manufactured to be used on public highways, streets, and roads (hereafter "public streets") are nonetheless being used on the public streets in the unincorporated area of Glynn County. However, Glynn County has concluded that public streets in the unincorporated area of Glynn County which have a posted speed limit of 25 miles per hour or less are suitable to safely accommodate both regular vehicle traffic and personal transportation vehicles without adversely impacting traffic safety or the travel needs of other users if operated as required by this Ordinance. All persons who operate or ride in personal transportation vehicles, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on public streets do so with their own judgment and at their own risk, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, Glynn County has no liability in negligence, nuisance or under any other cause of action for losses resulting from the use of personal transportation vehicles, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on roads, rights-of-way or other public property under this Ordinance. Any person who operates personal transportation vehicles, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by any law of the State of Georgia or this Ordinance as a condition of operating same on the roads of Glynn County.
( Ord. No. O-2019-04 , 7/18/2019)
