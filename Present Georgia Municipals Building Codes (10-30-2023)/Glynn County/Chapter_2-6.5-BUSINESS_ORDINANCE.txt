This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "Door-to-Door Commercial Solicitation Ordinance of Glynn County."

The intent of the Glynn County Commissioners in enacting this ordinance is to regulate the sale of goods and services by soliciting at residences in the County, to the end that criminal activity in the County and abusive techniques utilized by any such solicitors which adversely affect the public health safety and welfare in the County will be curtailed.
