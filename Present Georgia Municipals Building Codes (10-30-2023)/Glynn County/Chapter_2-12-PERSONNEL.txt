2-12-23 - Policy.
Policy. It is the policy of the Board of Commissioners and the Appointing Authority to treat all covered employees in a fair and impartial manner. The Board of Commissioners and the Appointing Authority are firmly committed to the belief that undisclosed problems will remain unresolved, and eventually lead to a decay of working relationships, dissatisfaction in working conditions, and a decline in operational efficiency. Accordingly, the Board of Commissioners hereby establishes an administrative review system, the intent of which is to solve problems as quickly, fairly, and informally as possible.
Employees who seek resolution of employment disputes by using established procedures will not be subjected to discrimination, retaliation, or be penalized in any way for their use of these procedures.
2-12-24 - Administrative Review System.
Regular covered employees, who have complaints, problems, concerns or disputes with another employee not related to proposed or adverse action, the nature of which adversely affects the employee, may file a grievance, according to procedures herein established. Such grievance must be reasonably related to specific working conditions such as job safety, unfair treatment, compensation, job classification, reassignments, or any form of alleged discrimination.
2-12-25 - Informal Administrative Review.
A regular covered employee having a complaint, problem, concern or dispute shall make every effort to resolve the matter through an informal discussion with his or her immediate supervisor within seven working days of the occurrence or cause of such matter or, in the alternative, if such employee's work unit structure is such that the immediate supervisor is subordinate to another supervisor, the aggrieved covered employee may request a discussion with both supervisors within this time period. The supervisor(s) will take the matter under consideration and attempt to resolve it verbally or provide a satisfactory explanation within five calendar days, unless additional time is needed to gather information necessary to resolve the matter. If the department head is the employee's immediate supervisor, the employee shall proceed directly to formal administrative review within seven days of the occurrence.
2-12-26 - Formal Administrative Review.
If after informal administrative review the employee's grievance remains unresolved, or is not resolved to the employee's satisfaction, the aggrieved employee may file a written request for an Administrative Review with his or her department head, or which the Appointing Authority within five calendar days following the supervisor's response. The department head or the Appointing Authority will arrange a meeting with the employee to allow the employee an opportunity to present a personal and complete description of the grievance. The department head or the Appointing Authority will take into consideration all matters presented to him, including any necessary investigation or evaluation of the facts related to the situation, and render a written decision, response, or explanation as expeditiously as possible, but not to exceed seven calendar days from the date of the meeting with the employee.
If an employee is not satisfied with the outcome of the decision rendered by the department head or Appointing Authority, he or she may appeal the decision to the Personnel Director within five calendar days from the date of such a decision. If the Personnel Director feels that the subject matter of the complaint has county-wide importance, he will refer the matter to the Personnel Review Board for its decision, to be rendered within 21 calendar days of the transfer. If the subject matter of the complaint is determined not to be of county-wide importance, the Personnel Director will review the decision of the Department Head or the Appointing Authority and will, within 14 calendar days, render a decision. If the Personnel Director agrees with the department head, or appointing authority, the decision shall be final and conclusive. If the Personnel Director and department head, or appointing authority, do not agree on a solution to the grievance, no decision shall be rendered but the matter shall be referred to the County Administrator or to the County Officer, if applicable, for a decision which shall be rendered within 14 calendar days of the transfer. The decision of the County Administrator or the County Officer shall be final and conclusive and then the County Administrator or the Appointing Authority may, in the exercise of his or her discretion, render a decision based on a written record or may hold an informal hearing on the matter.
2-12-27 - Exceptions to Procedural Steps.
Glynn County recognizes that there may arise certain situations in which it may be inappropriate for employees to pursue the resolution of a grievance in the prescribed sequence. Consequently, the following exceptions are instances where an employee may bypass these procedural steps, after having obtained the written approval of the Personnel Director, to seek resolution of a grievance by the next higher authority under circumstances appropriate to the relief sought. Employees who are uncertain as to the proper authority, or the method, should discuss the matter confidentially with the Personnel Director. The following matters may warrant a change in the procedural steps:
(a)
If the complaint or problem involves a known or suspected violation of law;
(b)
If the complaint or problem is clearly not within the authority of the employee's superior to resolve;
(c)
If the employee and superior mutual agree to bypass the superior's review;
(d)
If the nature of the complaint, problem or dispute involves or has been caused by the employee's superior, and the employee, with the concurrence of the Personnel Director, has reason to believe the superior may be less than impartial;
(e)
If the nature of the complaint or problem involves sexual harassment; or
(f)
If the nature of the complaint involves any sort of deprivation or discrimination prohibited by the Constitution of the United States, Constitution of the State of Georgia, or any federal, state or local law.
2-12-28 - Adverse Action.
Depending on the nature and circumstances of an incident, adverse action will normally be progressive and bear a reasonable relationship to the violation(s) charged. The types of adverse action that may be imposed under this ordinance are as follows:
(a)
Verbal Reprimand. A verbal statement by a supervisor or other appropriate official, to an employee, which points out an unsatisfactory element of job performance, and is corrective or cautionary in nature. A verbal reprimand should define the area or areas of needed improvement by the employer, set up goals for achievement of the improvement, and inform the employee that failure to improve the area of deficiency may result in a more serious adverse action.
(b)
Written Reprimand. A written statement which points out an unsatisfactory element of job performance, and is corrective or cautionary in nature. A written reprimand should define the area or areas of needed improvement by the employer, set up goals for achievement of the improvement, and inform the employee that failure to improve the area of deficiency may result in a more serious adverse action. A written reprimand shall be issued by the employee's immediate supervisor with the approval of the employee's department head or the Appointing Authority.
(c)
Probationary Period. A regular employee may be placed in a probationary status for disciplinary reasons for a period not to exceed 60 calendar days during which time the employee will be expected to meet specific goals, as set out in memoranda from the department head or Appointing Authority to the employee, which memoranda shall be signed by the employee. If the regular employee fails to meet such goals, he may subject himself to additional adverse action.
(d)
Suspension. A regular employee may be suspended with or without pay from employment with Glynn County, or the Appointing Authority, if applicable, for a period of time not to exceed 30 days or ten shifts. Such a suspension may be imposed by a department head or the Appointing Authority when alternative personnel action such as demotion or dismissal may not be warranted, appropriate or deemed in the best interest of Glynn County or the Appointing Authority.
(e)
Pay Reduction. A regular employee's pay rate may be reduced for disciplinary reasons, upon the recommendation of the employee's immediate supervisor and with the approval of the department head or Appointing Authority.
(f)

(g)
Dismissal. A regular employee may be dismissed for good cause from employment with Glynn County by the department head with the concurrence of the County Administrator, or the Appointing Authority, for disciplinary reasons.

A new Notice of Proposed Adverse Action may then be instituted against the employee in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance.
