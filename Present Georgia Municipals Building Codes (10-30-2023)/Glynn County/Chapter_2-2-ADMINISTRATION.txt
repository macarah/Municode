2-2-13 - Purchasing Policies.
(a)
Pre-Authorization.
1.
Funds must be budgeted prior to making any acquisition of material, goods, or services. Should unbudgeted capital equipment become necessary, a funding source(s) must be identified by the requesting Department/Agency and acquisition approval granted by the County Manager for unbudgeted capital equipment costing less than $50,000.00. The County Manager will provide the Board of Commissioners a monthly report of unbudgeted capital equipment approvals he or she granted during the preceding month. The authority to approve acquisition of unbudgeted capital equipment costing $50,000.00 or more lies with the Board of Commissioners. Transferring of funds in, out, or within capital improvement(s) categories is not permitted without approval of the Board of Commissioners.
2.
All non-budgeted material, goods, or services requiring formal competitive bidding must be approved by the Board of Commissioners prior to bidding.
3.
All acquisitions must follow County bidding procedures, and where applicable, state law.
4.
For expenditures valued less than $50,000.00, the Department Director or his/her designee shall secure at least three written quotes and submit the quotes to the Procurement Officer or his/her designee for review and rejection or approval. For expenditures valued at $50,000.00 or more, the Department Director or his/her designee shall provide a description of the job and detailed scope of work, to include project location, allotted time for the project, and plans/drawings associated with the project, to the Procurement Officer. In addition, for an RFP, the Department Director shall provide to the Procurement Officer the specific tasks expected to be completed and an explanation of the evaluation to be used to award a winner. The Procurement Officer shall use this information to create the IFB or RFP to secure competitive sealed bids or proposals. The type of bid will be determined by the dollar amount of the purchase in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this Ordinance. Competitive bids will be taken in order to assure open and competitive bidding on County purchases. Bid specifications will be prepared in such a manner as to invite and encourage bidding from all suppliers of goods and equipment being purchased by the County.
5.
Materials, supplies, and equipment purchased by the County on a regular basis will be standardized as much as possible in an effort to purchase goods and services at the best possible prices. Purchases will be made through the use of standard specifications established by the Procurement Department whenever possible. Each standard specification will apply in terms and effect to the purchase or contract for the item or service described in the specification. However, if any item requested by a department is not on the standard list or listed as an exemption, the Procurement Department is authorized to exempt the item if sufficient justification in writing is provided by the requesting department.
If a requisition is submitted for a brand name item or particular service, the Procurement Department shall notify the requesting department of acceptable and approved like items or services which meet the specification requirements except as noted in section 2-2-11 (ee) and (ff) above.
6.
All quotes will be documented as to the vendor, amount quoted, description and specification of the product, contact person and delivery costs and date by using a quote summary form. The quote summary form and received quotes will serve as backup documentation for the purchase.
(b)
Authorization.
1.
Any item, group of items, or service whose total cost, including fees, charges, taxes, etc., equals $1,500.00 or less may be acquired through the use of the County Purchasing Card.
2.
Any item, group of items, or service whose total cost, including fees, charges, taxes, etc., equals more than $1,500.00 but less than $50,000.00 requires three written quotes obtained by the Department Director or his/her designee and submitted to the Procurement Officer or his/her designee from the Vendor/Provider. The requisition for purchase must be approved by the Division Manager or Department Director. A purchase order, signed by the Procurement Officer on behalf of the Board of Commissioners, is required.
3.
Any item, group of items, or service whose total cost, including fees, charges, taxes, etc., is anticipated to be $50,000.00 or more shall require formal competitive bidding by the Procurement Officer and award made by the Board of Commissioners, even if the purchase was previously approved in the Fiscal Year Budget. The requisition for purchase must be approved by the Department Director. A purchase order, signed by the Procurement Officer on behalf of the Board of Commissioners, is required.
(c)
Exceptions. All acquisitions shall follow the process outlined in Section 2-2-13(b) with the following exceptions:
1.
Services that are of an expected and continuing nature, including but not limited to, (utility bills, travel, seminar and conference fees, membership dues, subscription costs, maintenance agreements) and payments made under the terms of a previously approved contract are exempt from the purchasing process and purchase order requirements.
2.
The County Manager shall have the authority to exempt the procurement of professional services whose total cost is anticipated to be less than $50,000.00 from the acquisition procedures and limits set forth in Section 2-2-13(b). Professional services whose total cost is anticipated to be $50,000.00 or more shall follow the acquisition procedures and limits set forth in Section 2-2-13(b) and the RFP procedure set forth in Section 2-2-14(b)(2). At the discretion of the Board of Commissioners, the procurement of such services or policies may be exempted from all bidding requirements with the approval of five (5) or more members of the Board of Commissioners. The bidding requirements of this Section shall not apply to the procurement of professional services as a result of an emergency need, which may or may not include a declaration of a state of emergency, as certified by the County Manager. The hiring or retaining of legal counsel shall be approved by the County Attorney and shall be exempt from all acquisition procedures and limits of Section 2-2-13(b).
a.
A request for quotations document will be sent to professional service firms interested in providing professional services to the County. Respondents will be requested to indicate their interest in the project, their ability to perform the services requested and their fee for the services requested. Firms interested in being included in professional service requests for quotations may contact the Procurement Officer to be considered for future requests for quotations of professional services.
b.
It is the policy of this County to award contracts for professional services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications at a fair and reasonable price with the ultimate selection based on the best interest of the County and receipt of maximum value.
c.
The selection process for professional services shall follow the authorization limits under 2-2-13(b) or the RFP procedure set forth in Section 2-2-14(b)(2) unless specifically exempted by the Board of Commissioners or unless exempted pursuant to Section 2-2-13(c)(2) above. When the selection process for professional services is handled in any way other than through an RFP or the procedures described in Section 2-2-13(c)(2), it shall be governed by procedures as determined by the Board of Commissioners. Such procedures shall permit as much competition as possible consistent with obtaining qualified persons and/or firms to perform necessary professional services. The selection process may vary from type to type of professional service or according to the purpose of an individual contract.
d.
For professional services selected through the normal process, using a request for proposals and being handled through the Procurement Department, the user departments or agencies, along with the Procurement Officer, will have primary responsibility for the service requirements and evaluation of the proposals, while the Procurement Department will ensure that the process is handled properly and that appropriate documentation is maintained. Generally, the qualifications of the vendors are the determining factor in the award. Accordingly, contract negotiation is permitted and encouraged.
3.
Budgeted materiel and goods purchases (i.e., vending machine goods, goods for resale, gasoline, diesel fuel, mosquito control chemicals, janitorial supplies, office supplies, etc.) whose unit price has been bid, as certified by the Procurement Officer, shall be exempt from further bidding for the life of the bid. This period cannot exceed 12 consecutive months without formal approval by the Board of Commissioners. A purchase order, signed by the Procurement Officer on behalf of the Board of Commissioners, is required.
4.
Budgeted materiel, goods, or services from a single or sole source vendor, as certified by the Procurement Officer, are exempt from the bidding process only, with the approval of the Board of Commissioners for purchases that are anticipated to be $50,000.00 or more. Prior to a single source procurement action, the Department Director or his/her designee shall explore all reasonably viable options to allow potential competition, including but not limited to defining the requirements of the procurement action so as to separate attributes that are strictly required from those attributes that are only desired. The Department Director or his/her designee is responsible for performing the due diligence and providing documentation for a single or sole source requested procurement action to the Procurement Officer so the Procurement Officer can make an informed decision. A requisition for purchase along with a memorandum documenting the reasons (i.e., special scientific technology, extraordinary specifications, and compatibility with existing equipment, etc.) for the single or sole source determination and a purchase order, signed by the Procurement Officer on behalf on the Board of Commissioners, is required. This exemption shall not apply to federal- or state-funded grants. The single source exemption shall not apply to public works construction projects whose total cost is anticipated to be $100,000.00 or more.
5.
Budgeted vehicle or equipment parts or maintenance/repair vendor services up to $20,000.00 shall follow the requirements of Section 2- 2-13(b)(2). For heavy equipment repairs, only those vendors certified as factory authorized dealers will be allowed to submit a bid for the repairs contemplated. This exception permits award to be made by the Public Works Director or Fire Chief, as appropriate. A requisition for purchase and a purchase order, signed by the Procurement Officer on behalf of the Board of Commissioners, is required.
a.
The Procurement Officer in considering bids for capital heavy equipment may consider, in addition to the bid price, the guaranteed delivery, maintenance and operating costs as well as the guaranteed resale or buy back price of equipment at established time intervals when purchasing equipment.
6.
An emergency need outside of normal business hours requiring the immediate purchase of materiel, goods, or services, in an amount not to exceed $5,000.00, can be approved by the Department Director for the protection of the best interests of the County. The acquisition shall be reported to the County Manager and the Procurement Officer in writing the next business day. A requisition for purchase subsequent to the emergency purchase shall require a purchase order signed by the Procurement Officer on behalf of Board of Commissioners.
7.
In the event of a declared state of emergency, or under circumstances necessitated by emergency conditions involving public safety or the preservation of property or public services, the Board of Commissioners or the County Manager may suspend all or part of this Procurement Ordinance, or any policies and procedures promulgated thereunder. During any such event or circumstances, the County Manager may approve unbudgeted purchases up to $100,000.00 without prior Board approval, and the County Manager shall keep the Board informed of those purchases. Prior to a suspension of the Procurement Ordinance or related policy or procedure under circumstances necessitated by emergency conditions, a finding that such circumstances exist shall be made in writing by either: (1) the Board of Commissioners; or (2) the County Manager, the County Chief Financial Officer, and the Chairman of the Board of Commissioners.
8.
Whenever any services, supplies, materials, or equipment which meet all county requirements are available through a contract with the State of Georgia, the Federal Government, or other local government cooperative programs (i.e., the National Association of Counties, the Government Purchasing Alliance, etc.), the Procurement Officer is authorized to purchase the services, supplies, materials or equipment from these contracts when such actions are lower in price than competitive bidding could provide or advantageous to operational efficiency. A requisition for purchase and a purchase order, signed by the Procurement Officer on behalf of the Board of Commissioners, is required.
9.
Purchases directly from the Georgia Department of Administrative Services, Georgia Surplus Property Agency and Georgia Correctional Industries storage warehouses may be made by Department Directors. If purchases are requested by Department Directors from any other agency or department that maintains a warehouse for supplies, materials, or equipment, the Department Director shall contact the Procurement Officer who will verify that the supplies, materials, or equipment to be purchased have been competitively acquired. Said verification must be completed prior to purchasing such supplies, materials, or equipment. A requisition for purchase and a purchase order, signed by the Procurement Officer on behalf of the Board of Commissioners, is required for all purchases made pursuant to this subsection.
10.
The budgeted purchase of parts, materials, or services for the repair of county facilities and heavy equipment and the budgeted purchase of fuel and employee gift cards, any of which are anticipated to be less than $50,000.00, may follow the requirements of section 2-2-13(b)(24) in lieu of formal competitive bidding; provided however, in order for the purchase of parts, materials, or services for repairs to be exempt from formal competitive bidding under this paragraph, the repair should be of an unanticipated nature and limited to circumstances where the failure to make such repair in a prompt manner would be detrimental to public safety, public property, or to the County's operations and ability to provide basic services, as certified by the Procurement Officer and either the Public Works Director or Facilities Supervisor.
11.
The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority and discretion to exempt the procurement of pre-owned heavy equipment for use by the Public Works Department from the acquisition procedures and bidding requirements set forth in Section 2-2-13(b). A request to exempt the procurement of pre-owned heavy equipment may be initiated by a request from the Public Works Director to the County Manager. The request shall include an opinion from the Public Works Fleet Manager concerning the condition of the equipment and whether it is advisable to purchase pre-owned equipment rather than new. If the County Manager concurs with the request, it shall be placed before the Board of Commissioners for consideration. For purposes of this provision, the term heavy equipment shall mean bulldozers, tractors, backhoes, and other similar heavy construction equipment and shall not include automobiles or light trucks (i.e. pick-up trucks). The Board of Commissioners shall also have the authority and discretion to exempt the procurement of pre-owned buildings for use by any department from the acquisition procedures and bidding requirements set forth in Section 2-2-13(b). For purposes of this provision, the term building shall mean industrialized buildings, modular buildings, or any other type of manufactured building. These provisions shall not apply where prohibited by state or federal law.
12.
The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority and discretion to exempt the procurement and/or acquisition of Information Technology Resources from the acquisition procedures and bidding requirements set forth in Section 2-2-13(b). For purposes of this Section, Information Technology Resources means licensed, copyrighted, or patented computer hardware, software, or services; new computer equipment, products, peripherals, services, and software where compatibility with existing equipment or products is desirable or necessary; proprietary or custom built software or information systems; technology services, consulting, and maintenance contracts; web-based software and software as service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) applications or solutions.

2-2-14 - Formal Competitive Bidding Procedure.
(a)
Public Works Construction Prequalification Process. Potential bidders or offerors shall be required to be prequalified before being permitted to submit a bid or proposal on public works construction projects that are anticipated to cost $200,000.00 and over. When it is determined to be in the best interest of Glynn County by the Procurement Officer, potential bidders or offerors may be required to be prequalified before being permitted to submit a bid or proposal on public works construction projects that are anticipated to cost under $200,000.00. Potential bidders or offerors shall not be required to be prequalified before being permitted to submit a bid or proposal on demolition or asbestos removal projects.
When prequalification for a project is required, a potential bidder or offeror that is currently prequalified by the Georgia Department of Transportation shall be deemed prequalified for horizontal projects upon the presentation of a prequalification packet that includes a copy of a valid and current Certificate of Qualification issued by the Georgia Department of Transportation. Horizontal projects are those projects for which road, drainage, or bridge work is anticipated by the Procurement Officer to account for 80 percent or more of the total project work. Prequalification by the Georgia Department of Transportation may be used for any projects in which the conditions of federal or state project funding specify the necessity of such bid prequalification.
If the potential bidder or offeror does not possess a valid and current Certificate of Qualification issued by the Georgia Department of Transportation or if the potential bidder or offeror desires to become prequalified for projects other than horizontal projects, the potential bidder or offeror must become prequalified before being permitted to submit a bid or proposal on all projects not considered horizontal projects by possessing certain minimum criteria, as set forth in the pre-qualification criteria, questionnaire, and as established by the Procurement Officer, that are reasonably related to the specific project or the quality of work of a potential bidder or offeror. For example, potential bidders or offerors that are required to become prequalified by possessing the minimum criteria before being permitted to submit a bid or proposal may be required to:
1.
Be properly licensed;
2.
Provide references on past projects;
3.
Provide references to show a history of compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances relating to performance of past projects;
4.
Provide evidence that they have the ability to obtain any necessary permits;
5.
Provide assurance that the firm has stable financial and human resources and capabilities to successfully perform the project within the time specified, within budget, and without delay or interference;
6.
Show that the potential bidder or offeror has the necessary character, integrity, reputation, and judgment;
7.
Have an appropriate amount of experience on similar projects; and
8.
Provide any other criteria that are reasonably related to the specific project.
A statement that only prequalified bidders or offerors will be permitted to submit bids or proposals on a particular project shall be included in all advertisements for a project where prequalification is required. If a particular project is determined to be a horizontal project, all advertisements shall state such determination. Similarly, a copy of this policy, the specific prequalification criteria for a particular project, and the deadline for submission of the prequalification packet shall be posted on the Glynn County Website and included in all requests for proposals or invitations for bids. Copies shall also be in the Procurement Officer's office. This policy, any criteria specific to the project, and the prequalification questionnaire shall be made available to any prospective bidder or offeror or any other member of the public requesting such information.
A prequalification application packet, which shall consist of a completed prequalification questionnaire and any necessary attachments, must be received by the Procurement Officer prior to the established deadline. All prequalification questionnaires must be typewritten or handwritten in ink. Bonding and bank information shall be considered confidential and will not be subject to disclosure pursuant to the Open Records Act. The Procurement Officer shall evaluate timely submitted prequalification application packets using the established prequalification criteria. A contractor discovered providing false material information in an application for prequalification or during any consideration for prequalification shall be disqualified from submitting a bid or proposal on any Glynn County project for a period of five years.
Potential bidders or offerors submitting prequalification packets shall be notified whether they are prequalified or disqualified. The decision of the Procurement Officer shall be final. Only prequalified bidders or offerors may submit bids or proposals. Disqualified bidders or offerors may respond to their disqualification by a letter to the Procurement Officer within ten days of notice of disqualification. The opportunity for a disqualified potential bidder or offeror to provide a letter is for name-clearing purposes only; it shall not be construed as a right to appeal, to be reinstated, or to protest the process or the award of the project. The Procurement Officer shall include a copy of the letter in the contract file and provide copies to any party requesting such information.
When a potential bidder or offeror is prequalified, that bidder or offeror shall be prequalified to submit bids or proposals for a period of three years from the date of prequalification.
Potential bidders or offerors who desire to become prequalified for a project and have previously been prequalified for another project may inform the Procurement Officer in writing prior to the established deadline that they would like to apply to become prequalified for the current project using their previously submitted prequalification application packet. However, a prequalification application packet may only be used for prequalification consideration for a period of three years from the date of initial prequalification.
(b)
Formal Competitive Bidding Methods. All acquisitions requiring Formal Competitive Bidding are subject to the following bidding procedures. The Procurement Officer will determine which method to use based on the requesting Department's ability to quantitatively and qualitatively describe its requirements.
1.
Invitation for Bids (IFB). In most cases, the invitation for bids is the preferred method of source selection and should be used whenever possible as it allows qualified, responsive vendors to compete on the basis of price. The selection decision would therefore be determined by the responsible and responsive vendor offering the lowest bid price. Generally, the following conditions must be met:
a.
Clear and adequate specifications are available.
b.
The item, material, or service does not qualify as a single or sole source purchase.
c.
The anticipated cost of goods, materials, supplies, equipment or project is $50,000.00 or greater.
i.
Notice of Bidding. It shall be the duty of the Procurement Officer to solicit sealed bids from reputable owners of supplies in all cases where the total requirement will be $50,000.00 or more. Notice inviting sealed bids shall be posted conspicuously in the lobby of the first floor of the Harold Pate Building and shall either be advertised in the legal organ of the County or by electronic means on the County's Website. Except as otherwise stated in this paragraph, bids may be solicited by advertisement in a newspaper of state-wide circulation, or in the legal organ of the County, at least once and for at least 15 calendar days prior to opening the bids. Bids expected to be $100,000.00 or more shall also be posted on the Georgia Procurement Registry. Contract opportunities that are advertised on the County's website shall be posted continuously for at least 15 days prior to the opening of the sealed bids.
Other methods of advertisement, however, may be adopted by the County when such other methods are deemed more advantageous for the particular item to be purchased.
For Federal grant contract opportunities, or public works construction project opportunities involving an expenditure of $100,000.00 or more, if such opportunities are advertised in the legal organ of the County, they shall be advertised a minimum of two times, with the first advertisement occurring at least four weeks prior to the opening of the sealed bids, and the second advertisement following no earlier than two weeks from the first advertisement. If such opportunities are advertised solely on the Internet, they shall be posted continuously for at least four weeks prior to the opening of sealed bids.
Plans and specifications shall be available on the first day of the advertisement and shall be open to inspection by the public. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, contract opportunities for any insurance policy or insurance service requiring formal bidding shall be advertised: (1) in the legal organ a minimum of two times, with the first advertisement occurring at least four weeks prior to the opening of the sealed bids and the second advertisement following no earlier than two weeks from the first advertisement; or (2) by posting the contract opportunity on the County's website continuously for at least four weeks prior to the opening of the sealed bids. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in optimal competition may be used in addition to the required advertisement, at the discretion of the Procurement Officer.
ii.
Pre-bid Conference. A pre-bid conference may be convened between the date of advertisement and the actual bid opening date. The purpose of the conference is to clarify advertised specifications for prospective responsive vendors.
iii.
Receipt of Bids. Electronic Bid Submissions shall be submitted to the Glynn County portal no later than the date and time specified in the IFB when electronic bid submissions are acceptable and available.
Sealed Envelope Submission (Hard Copy): The outside of the sealed envelope should be clearly marked with the bid title to avoid confusion. No hard copy sealed bid submission shall be eligible for consideration by the County unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the Procurement Officer by the date and time specified in the invitation for bids. The Procurement Officer shall cause all bids to be stamped with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time.
A bid delivered late shall under no circumstances be eligible for consideration by the County and such bid shall be returned unopened to the vendor.
iv.
Bid Opening. Sealed bid submissions and electronic bid submissions shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The name of each vendor, the purchase price contained in each bid, and such other information as the Procurement Officer deems appropriate shall be announced as the bids are opened. A record of bid information shall be recorded and available for public inspection.
v.
Modification of Bids. Any clerical mistake which is patently obvious on the face of a bid may, subject to the limitations described below, be corrected upon written request and verification submitted by the vendor. A nonmaterial omission in a bid may be corrected if the Procurement Officer determines the correction to be in the County's best interests. Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening:
1.
Unit price information.
2.
Total price information when unit prices are not required.
3.
Any required insurance.
vi.
Withdrawal of Bids. Bids may be withdrawn at any time prior to the bid opening. With the concurrence of the Procurement Officer, vendors may be allowed to withdraw bids containing mistakes not discovered until after the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, withdrawal of bid shall be based upon the following: The vendor shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid due to an error within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure. Bids may be withdrawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. The vendor's original work papers shall be the sole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if he elects to withdraw his bid. In all other cases, bids will be accepted unconditionally without alteration or correction. When bids are accepted where unit prices are shown, the County may correct obvious extensions and footing errors after advising the vendor in writing. If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsible, responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid.
vii.
Bid Evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that are not specifically set forth in the solicitation.
viii.
Bid Cancellation. An invitation for bids may be canceled prior to opening date or any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of Glynn County in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Procurement Department or as a result of improper conduct on the part of a county employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the bid file.
ix.
Bid Award.
1.
Responsive and Responsible Vendor(s). A contract shall be awarded, if awarded, to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids.
2.
Approval of Bids. All bid awards for amounts of $50,000.00 or greater shall be approved by the Board of Commissioners.
3.
Rejection of Bids. The County reserves the right to reject any or all bids if it determines such rejection to be in the best interest of the County in accordance with Section 2-2-16 of this ordinance.
4.
Disqualification of Bids. The following types of bids shall be disqualified for consideration for a bid award:
a.
A bid which is incomplete in any material aspect.
b.
A bid submitted without required bonds or insurance. The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority and discretion to consider an incomplete bid or a bid submitted without the required bonds or insurance when only one responsive bid is received and the bidder cures the deficiency within ten business days of the bid opening.
This authority and discretion shall not extend to projects subject to the competitive bidding requirements of the "Georgia Local Government Public Works Construction Law", O.C.G.A. § 36-91-1 et seq., the bidding requirements for road construction contracts in Chapter 4, Title 32, of the Official Code of Georgia, or where prohibited by state or federal law.
5.
Tie Bids. In the event two or more responsible and responsive bids are tied for the lowest price and the other terms and conditions of the tied bids are substantially the same, the bid shall be awarded to the local vendor if only one of the vendors has its principal place of business in the County. If all or none of the tied vendors have its principal place of business in the County, then the bid award shall be made to the winner of a coin toss by the Procurement Officer in a public session where vendors and one or more witness may be present.
6.
Local Vendor. There is established in Glynn County a local vendor privilege. The Board of Commissioners believes that bids awarded to local vendors contribute to the local tax base and benefit the economy of Glynn County and will therefore be given special consideration when bidding.
a.
A local vendor shall be afforded the opportunity to match the bid amount of the lowest responsive and responsible bid if: (1) the lowest responsive and responsible bidder is not a local vendor; (2) the local vendor is the second lowest responsive and responsible bidder; and, (3) the local vendor's bid is within two percent or $10,000.00, whichever is less, or within $500.00 of the lowest bid. If the local vendor agrees to match the amount of the low bid received from the out-of-county vendor within the time specified by the County, the bid shall be awarded to the local vendor. If the local vendor does not agree to match the low bid received from the out-of-county vendor within the time specified by the County, the bid shall be awarded to the out-of-county vendor.
b.
In the event that more than one local vendor meets the criteria in subsection (a), the opportunity to match the low bid shall be afforded to the winner of a coin toss by the Procurement Officer in a public session where vendors and one or more witness may be present.
c.
This local vendor privilege shall not apply to any bid or contract that is subject to the competitive bidding requirements of the "Georgia Local Government Public Works Construction Law", O.C.G.A. § 36-91-1 et seq., the bidding requirements for road construction contracts in Chapter 4, Title 32, of the Official Code of Georgia, federal- or state-funded grants, or where prohibited by state or federal law.
2.
Request for Proposals (RFP). When use of the invitation for bids is either not practicable or not advantageous to the County, a contract may be entered into by use of a sealed request for proposals. Generally, the qualifications of the vendors are the determining factor in the award. Accordingly, contract negotiation is permitted and encouraged. Use of the proposal is dependent upon such factors as:
• The scope of work for the contract cannot be accurately and completely defined.
• The service or product can be provided in several different ways, any of which could be acceptable.
• Contractor qualifications and the quality of the service to be delivered can be considered more important than the contract price.
• The expected responses may contain a different level of services than that requested, requiring negotiation to reduce or increase prices relative to the available budget.
a.
Dissemination of Proposals. It shall be the duty of the Procurement Officer to solicit sealed proposals from reputable owners of supplies in all cases where the total requirement will be $50,000.00 or more. Notice inviting sealed proposals shall be posted conspicuously in the lobby of the first floor of the Harold Pate Building and shall either be advertised in the legal organ of the County or by electronic means on the County's Website. Except as otherwise stated in this paragraph, proposals may be solicited by advertisement in a newspaper of state-wide circulation, or in the legal organ of the County, at least once and for at least 15 calendar days prior to opening the proposals. Proposals expected to be $100,000.00 or more shall also be posted on the Georgia Procurement Registry. Contract opportunities that are advertised on the County's website shall be posted continuously for at least 15 days prior to the opening of the sealed proposals.
Other methods of advertisement, however, may be adopted by the County when such other methods are deemed more advantageous for the particular item to be purchased.
For Federal grant contract opportunities, or public works construction project opportunities involving an expenditure of $100,000.00 or more, if such opportunities are advertised in the legal organ of the County, they shall be advertised a minimum of two times, with the first advertisement occurring at least four weeks prior to the opening of the sealed proposals, and the second advertisement following no earlier than two weeks from the first advertisement. If such opportunities are advertised solely on the Internet, they shall be posted continuously for at least four weeks prior to the opening of sealed proposals.
Plans and specifications shall be available on the first day of the advertisement and shall be open to inspection by the public. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, contract opportunities for any insurance policy or insurance service requiring formal competitive bidding shall be advertised: (1) in the legal organ a minimum of two times, with the first advertisement occurring at least four weeks prior to the opening of the sealed proposal and the second advertisement following no earlier than two weeks from the first advertisement; or (2) by posting the contract opportunity on the County's website continuously for at least four weeks prior to the opening of the sealed proposals. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in optimal competition may be used in addition to the required advertisement, at the discretion of the Procurement Officer.
b.
Receipt of Proposals. Electronic Proposal Submissions shall be submitted to the Glynn County portal no later than the date and time specified in the RFP when electronic bid submissions are acceptable and available.
Sealed Envelope Submission (Hard Copy): The outside of the sealed envelope should be clearly marked with the proposal title to avoid confusion. No hard copy sealed proposal submission shall be eligible for consideration by the County unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the Procurement Officer by the date and time specified in the request for proposals. The Procurement Officer shall cause all proposals to be stamped with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time.
A proposal delivered late shall under no circumstances be eligible for consideration by the County and shall be returned unopened to the Proposer.
c.
Proposal Opening. Sealed proposal submissions and electronic proposal submissions shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the request for proposals. The name of each Proposer shall be announced but no other information shall be disclosed nor shall the proposals be considered public records until proposal is awarded.
d.
Proposal Cancellation. A request for proposals may be canceled prior to opening date or any or all proposals may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of the County in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Procurement Department or as a result of improper conduct on the part of a County employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the proposal file.
e.
Proprietary Information. Information submitted by a Proposer which is specifically marked "proprietary" shall not be disclosed outside of the Procurement Department without the prior written consent of the vendor or a determination by the Procurement Officer or a court that the information sought is not of a privileged or proprietary nature.
f.
Evaluation of Proposals.
i.
Initial Evaluation. Each proposal shall be evaluated to determine whether it is responsible and responsive to the specifications and other terms and conditions contained in the request for proposals. The evaluation criteria contained in the solicitation must be adhered to. In evaluating the proposals, the evaluating team may request supplemental information to clarify and amplify each vendor's proposal. No information concerning any other vendor's proposal shall be communicated in any way to the vendor.
ii.
Negotiation. As set forth in the solicitation, vendors submitting proposals may be afforded an opportunity for discussion, negotiation, and revision of proposals. Discussions, negotiations, and revisions may be permitted after submission of proposals and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers. In accordance with the solicitation, all responsible vendors found to have submitted proposals reasonably susceptible of being selected for award shall be given an opportunity to participate in such discussions, negotiations, and revisions. During the process of discussion, negotiation, and revisions, the evaluating team shall not disclose the contents of proposals to competing vendors.
iii.
Local Vendor. There is established in Glynn County a local vendor privilege. The Board of Commissioners believes that proposals awarded to local vendors contribute to the local tax base and benefit the economy of Glynn County and will therefore be given special consideration when making a proposal. Local preference shall be included in a request for proposals as an evaluation criterion to be considered by the evaluating team. Two percent of the total points available to each proposer shall be awarded on the basis of whether the proposal was submitted by a local vendor. Local vendors shall be entitled to and shall receive the local preference points provided for in this subsection. This local vendor privilege shall not apply when utilizing federal- or state-funded grants or where prohibited by state or federal law.
g.
Award of Proposal.
i.
Award shall be made to the responsible and responsive vendor whose proposal is determined in writing to be the best value to the County, taking into consideration the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation. The evaluation factors shall be the basis on which the award decision is made. The contract file shall indicate the basis on which the award is made.
ii.
Approval of Proposals. All proposals where the cost is $50,000.00 or more shall be approved by the Board of Commissioners.
iii.
Rejection of Proposals. The County reserves the right to reject any or all proposals if it determines such rejection to be in the best interest of the County in accordance with Section 2-2-16 of this ordinance.
iv.
Disqualification of Proposals. The following types of proposals shall be disqualified for consideration for award:
• A proposal submitted without the required bid bond.
The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority and discretion to consider a proposal submitted without the required bid bond when only one responsive proposal is received and the vendor cures the deficiency by submitting a bid bond within ten business days of the proposal opening.
This authority and discretion shall not extend to projects subject to the competitive bidding requirements of the "Georgia Local Government Public Works Construction Law", O.C.G.A. § 36-91-1 et seq., the bidding requirements for road construction contracts in Chapter 4, Title 32, of the Official Code of Georgia, federal- or state-funded grants, or where prohibited by state or federal law.

2-2-15 - Cooperative Procurement.
(a)
General. In lieu of section 2-2-13-(b), the Procurement Officer is authorized to participate in, sponsor, conduct or administer cooperative procurement with one or more states, municipalities, counties, public agencies, or public organizations to purchase items and services from the same vendor in order to combine requirements, increase efficiency or reduce administrative expenses.
(b)
Cooperative Procurement Techniques.
1.
The Procurement Officer may contact other states, municipalities, counties, public agencies, or public organizations to purchase items or services from the same vendor through group or joint contracts. The procurement is accomplished by combining the purchasing quantities or amounts into a single invitation— for bids for all parties to the cooperative procurement agreement. One participant shall serve as the Lead Purchaser who shall be the participant with the greater quantity or amount for purchase. The Lead Purchaser shall perform the administrative details of preparing and issuing bid documents, analyzing and awarding bids and issuing a final contract to the successful bidder. Bids shall be awarded to the responsible bidder(s) who has submitted the lowest cost responsive bid(s). The Procurement Officer shall purchase the supplies, materials, equipment or services directly from the successful bidder(s). If Glynn County is the Lead Purchaser, all parties in the cooperative procurement shall purchase the supplies, materials, equipment or services directly from the successful bidder(s).
a.
If a Department Director is aware of a state, county, municipality, public agency, or public organization that is planning to seek bids for supplies, materials, equipment or services for which his/her department has a budgeted need, the Department Director shall contact the Procurement Officer with his/her desire to purchase through the cooperative procurement procedure. The Department Director shall provide documentation to the Procurement Officer that will assist in arranging for a joint bid with the other jurisdiction(s). The following information shall be provided:
i.
Detailed specifications for the item(s) or services to be purchased;
ii.
The amount or quantity to be purchased;
iii.
Program and Object codes for the budgeted item or services; and
iv.
The requested date of the delivery of the purchase.
The Procurement Officer will then contact the other participants requesting permission for Glynn County to enter into a cooperative procurement agreement. The Procurement Officer is authorized to enter into this agreement to purchase the supplies, materials, equipment or services from these contracts.
b.
Agreements entered into by the authority granted under this Section shall in no way create or authorize any partnership or joint agency between the parties to these agreements. All liability and damages arising from the prosecution of such agreements shall be the sole responsibility of each party, and each party shall be severally and not jointly liable under the agreement.
2.
a.
If the Procurement Officer determines that another state, municipality, county, public agency, or public organization has competitively entered into a contract for the purchase of supplies, materials, equipment or services, then the Procurement Officer is authorized to purchase from these contracts when such actions are lower in price or likely to be lower in price than Glynn County's sole competitive bidding could provide or is advantageous to the operational efficiency of Glynn County. In order to purchase from such contracts, the vendor shall agree to substantially the same terms and conditions as were offered to the contracting jurisdiction.
b.
If a Department Director determines that a contract for the sale of supplies, materials, equipment or services has been entered into by another state, municipality, county, public agency, or public organization that may be cost-saving or operationally efficient to the County, the Department Director shall submit a Purchase Requisition for the goods or services required. The requisition must be accompanied with a memorandum to the Procurement Officer detailing the specifics of the contract. Said memorandum shall be accompanied by:
i.
A copy of the agreement's contract period;
ii.
A copy of the agreement's fee schedule;
iii.
A copy of the bid tabulation sheet(s);
iv.
The name, phone and fax numbers, and e-mail address of the procurement officer involved in the procurement of the contract; and
v.
The name, phone and fax number, and e-mail address, of the successful vendor awarded the contract.
The Procurement Officer shall use this information to ensure the requirements of this subsection have been meet. The Procurement Officer will then contact the vendor to allow the County to purchase from the vendor by substantially the same terms and conditions as were offered to the contracting jurisdiction. Prior to the purchase, a purchase order, signed by the Procurement Officer on behalf of the Board of Commissioners, will be issued to such vendor for the purchase of the supplies, materials, equipment or services.
c.
Prohibited Cooperative Procurement Activities.
1.
All unit price agreements or contracts based on a cooperative procurement shall be the primary and sole source for purchasing by the departments or employees of Glynn County. No new or separate orders or contracts for materials, supplies, equipment or services which are subject to a cooperative procurement agreement shall be issued or sought prior to the completion or termination of the cooperative agreement(s).
2.
County employees shall be prohibited from procuring cooperative agreements by bargaining or negotiating a contract with a vendor not a party to the cooperative agreements through the use of contracts or information contained thereof from a county, or other party to such contract.
