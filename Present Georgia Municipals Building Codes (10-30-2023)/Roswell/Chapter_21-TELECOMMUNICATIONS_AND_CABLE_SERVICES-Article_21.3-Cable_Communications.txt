(e)
Indemnification. Through the foregoing contracts, the grantee shall indemnify and hold harmless the city, its officers, boards, commissions, agents, and employees, against and from any and all claims, demands, causes of actions, actions, suits, proceedings, damages (including, but not limited to, damages to city property and damages arising out of copyright infringements, and damages arising out of any failure by the grantee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors, or licensees of programs to be delivered by the grantee's CATV system), costs or liabilities (including costs or liabilities of the city with respect to its employees), of every kind and nature whatsoever including, but not limited to, damages for injury or death or damage to person or property, and against all liability to others, and against any loss, cost, and expense resulting or arising out of any of the same, including any attorney fees, accountant fees, expert witness or consultant fees, court costs, per diem expense, traveling and transportation expense, or other costs or expense arising out of or pertaining to the exercise or the enjoyment of any franchise granted hereunder.

This payment by the grantee to the city shall be in lieu of any applicable occupation tax, license tax, or other similar levy, and shall be paid quarterly. Nothing herein contained, however, shall in any way relieve the grantee or its assigns or successors from the obligation of paying any property taxes to the City of Roswell or any other governmental subdivision of the State of Georgia or any other taxes lawfully levied by the State of Georgia on the operation of grantees. Grantees shall file with the city administrator, within ninety (90) days after the expiration of any calendar year during the term of the rights granted hereunder, a statement prepared by a certified public accountant showing the gross revenues as defined herein.
