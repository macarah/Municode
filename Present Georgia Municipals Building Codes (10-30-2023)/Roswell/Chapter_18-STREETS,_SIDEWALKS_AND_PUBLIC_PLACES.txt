Section 18.1.7 - Installation of Sidewalks
Sidewalks shall be installed as follows:
(a)
All owners, developers or occupiers of parcels of land where a development permit or building permit is issued shall be required to provide a sidewalk adjacent to any public street along the entire lot frontage.
(b)
In cases where a development permit or building permit is sought on a tract of land proposed for single-family development requiring new public or private streets, the director of transportation shall require sidewalk installation along both sides of proposed public or private streets. Subsequently, the development permit shall indicate proposed construction of sidewalks along the entire road frontage on the designated sides of all proposed streets. The sidewalk shall be installed and the construction accepted by the director of transportation or his designee prior to a certificate of occupancy being issued for any building or structure for any lot or project on the designated sidewalk side of the roadway. Such sidewalk shall conform to the AASHTO and ADA requirements.
(c)
In the case of non-single-family development, sidewalks shall be required to be represented on design plans and development plans and installed in accordance with such plans along the total property frontage on public streets as required by the director of transportation.
(d)
In the event of private roadways in non-single-family developments, sidewalks shall be installed as required by the design review board or for historic properties as required by the historic preservation commission and approved by the director of transportation.
(e)
Where the director of transportation determines the topography of the road frontage is such that a special hardship exists on the property, he may authorize a payment to the City of Roswell in lieu of the required installation of the sidewalk. Criteria shall be established for all such approved hardships by the director of transportation to determine how the amount of payment will be calculated. Such criteria to determine the method of calculating such payment shall be approved by the mayor and city council and may be amended by the mayor and council thereafter upon recommendation of the director of transportation or the city administrator.
(f)
Where trees exist or other conditions exist, the director of transportation may require the sidewalks to meander in the right-of-way or into the lot where the permit is being sought. The director of transportation may encourage all sidewalks to meander where conditions allow such to occur.
(g)
The director of transportation shall require the sidewalk to be installed at least five (5) feet from the edge of the road pavement or the back of curb along the road unless the director determines a practical difficulty exists. Where the director has determined a practical difficulty exists, the sidewalk shall be installed no closer to the edge of the road or the back of the curb than two (2) feet unless authorized by the mayor and city council or the city administrator.
This section shall not apply to any lot or parcel for which a development permit or building permit is issued but where the community development director determines that the permit is for an accessory use or structure to the principal use or structure or for minor repairs or additions to the principal building or structure in existence. Sidewalks are not required in established communities originally permitted without sidewalks unless required by the community development director.
For any land or building development where sidewalks are required as outlined above and there is an existing sidewalk along the road or street frontage, an inspection of the sidewalk shall be made by the director of transportation or his agent. If the inspection shows the sidewalk is deficient or does not exist along the entire frontage, the owner must construct or repair the sidewalk to current design specifications including material revisions, such as concrete to brick, as required by the director of transportation.
Along public roads where a city sidewalk project is being or has been awarded for construction, the director of transportation may accept payment in lieu of the actual installation of the required sidewalk where in his opinion the acceptance of funds would be appropriate. Any payment in lieu of the installation of the required sidewalk shall be in an amount determined by the director of transportation or his designee. The funds received shall be deposited in an account of the City of Roswell and restricted to use for the installation of sidewalks.
The installation of the required sidewalk shall be completed prior to a certificate of occupancy being issued for the building or structure on the affected parcel.
The property owner shall be required to maintain the sidewalk along the entire lot frontage by maintaining the grass or landscaping installed between the sidewalk and the edge or curb of the roadway.

(a)
If any provision of this ordinance provides for the review of an application for a permit by a city officer designated therein, the administrator or his designee shall forward a copy of the application to that officer for recommendation.

Upon receipt of the recommendation of the reviewing officer, the administrator shall take action upon the application, although he may refer the same to the mayor and council for consideration at the next regular meeting.
(c)

The administrator shall issue a signed permit to an applicant therefore, which permit shall be dated and state the nature and time of the activity authorized.

No appeal shall be heard after thirty (30) days subsequent to denial of the application.
Upon appeal, the mayor and council shall determine the cause for denial and unless possible significant interference with the rights of non-participating citizens; an unreasonable obstruction of the orderly flow of traffic; a clear and present endangerment of Roswell citizens or another possible specific unreasonable interference with the public welfare, peace, safety, health, good order or convenience of the general public is shown, the permit shall be issued.
(f)
In no event shall any private organization or group of private persons be permitted to bring signs, banners, posters, leaflets, handbills or any other printed material of any size or shape containing any message intended to influence any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty at the City of Roswell City Hall, the City of Roswell Municipal Court, or the grounds upon which they stand.
