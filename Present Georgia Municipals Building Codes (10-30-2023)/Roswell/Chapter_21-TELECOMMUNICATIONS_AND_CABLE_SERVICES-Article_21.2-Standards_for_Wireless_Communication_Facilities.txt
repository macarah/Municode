Section 21.2.2 - Definitions.
Accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structure.
Alternative tower structure means man-made trees, clock towers, bell steeples, light poles and similar alternative-design mounting structures, that in the opinion of council, are compatible with the natural setting and surrounding structures, and effectively camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers.
Antenna shall mean any exterior transmitting or receiving devices mounted on a tower, building or structure and used in communications that radiate or capture electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals, radio, wireless telecommunications signals or other communications signals. Such definition does not include, for purposes of this article, radar antennas, amateur radio antennas, satellite earth stations, MMDS antennas, television receiving antennas and direct broadcast satellite dishes.
Co-location is the placement of antennas of two (2) or more service providers on the same tower or accessory structure.
Height when referring to a tower or other structure, means distance measured from the finished grade of the parcel to the highest point on the tower or other structure, including the base pad and any antenna.
Historic or scenic views mean geographic areas in Roswell which have been formally designated as part of the historic district; have been included in any nature preserve or scenic preservation efforts; or have sufficient historic or scenic merit as determined by council and the historic preservation commission so as to require preservation. A scenic view may be from a stationary viewpoint or be seen as one travels along a roadway or path.
Master siting plan refers to the siting map developed by council and approved by city council to identify appropriate sites for the location of wireless transmission facilities as may be amended from time to time. Such map may be derived from propriety information submitted by wireless providers.
Microcell means a wireless communication facility comprised of antennas extending no more than four (4) feet above the structure to which it is attached, and with an area no larger than five hundred seventy-six (576) square inches (e.g. 3' x 1Â½') panel antenna or a two-foot diameter parabolic antenna as viewed from any one point.
Preexisting towers and preexisting antennas mean any tower or antenna for which a building permit or special use permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance, including permitted towers or antennas that have not yet been constructed so long as such approval is current and not expired.
Technically feasible and viable means capable of being provided through technology which has been demonstrated in actual applications (not simply through tests or experiments) to operate in a workable manner.
Tower means any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one (1) or more antennas, including self-supported or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, and cellular telephone or PCS towers.
Wireless transmission facilities shall mean the buildings, cabinets, equipment and property, including but not limited to, generating and switching stations, repeaters, cables, wires, conduits, ducts, pedestals, antennas, towers, alternative tower structures, electronics and other appurtenances used to transmit, receive, distribute, provide or offer low-power mobile voice transmission, data transmission or other wireless communications by linking a wireless network of radio wave transmitting devices through a series of short range, contiguous cells that are part of an evolving cell grid.

(6)
Installing any antenna or tower not to exceed the limitations contained in subsection 21.2.5(f) in any area zoned AG-43, CX, CC, CH, OP, IX, IL or CIV and provided accessory structures are located underground, where technically feasible, or shielded to the satisfaction of the design review board.
(7)
Installing any antenna or tower in a location identified on the City of Roswell Master Siting Plan, as amended, provided accessory structures are located underground where technically feasible, or shielded to the satisfaction of the design review board.
If council determines that any application does not meet the general application requirements, development requirements and/or standards enumerated herein, or such application conflicts with the Master Siting Plan, approval of the application shall be denied provided substantial evidence exists to support such denial. Any aggrieved party may appeal the denial to the Fulton County Superior Court. For purposes of this section, an aggrieved party is one who demonstrates that his or her property will suffer special damage as a result of the decision complained of rather than merely some damage that is common to all property owners and citizens similarly situated.
(b)
If the proposed tower or antenna is not included under the above described expedited approval uses, or the application does not on its face satisfy the development standards and other criteria specified herein, then a public hearing before the mayor and council shall be required for the approval of the construction of a wireless transmission facility in all Unified Development Code (UDC) districts. Applicants shall apply for a public hearing through the community development department and pay the required $500.00 fee at such time. Applications, when complete, shall be placed on the next available agenda of the mayor and council at which Unified Development Code (UDC) matters are considered. At least thirty (30) days prior to any scheduled hearing, the community development department shall cause a sign to be posted on the property and the publication of a public notice in a newspaper of general circulation and notice sent to surrounding property owners as shown on the county tax records within one thousand (1,000) feet of the proposed tower or antenna. Said notice shall state the nature of the application, street location of the proposal and height of the proposed structure.
Before approving an application for an "other use," the governing authority may impose Unified Development Code (UDC) conditions to the extent necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. The factors considered in granting such a permit include those enumerated in sections 21.2.4 and 21.2.5. The mayor and council may waive one (1) or more of these criteria, if, in their discretion doing so will advance the goals of this article as stated in section 21.2.1. Approved applications shall be valid for one (1) year from the date of the approval by the mayor and council.
