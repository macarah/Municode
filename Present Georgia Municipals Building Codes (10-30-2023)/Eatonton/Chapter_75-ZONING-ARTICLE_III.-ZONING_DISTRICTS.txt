ARTICLE III. - ZONING DISTRICTS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 75-91. - Establishment and purpose of districts.
In order to implement the intent of this chapter, the official zoning maps shall divide the incorporated area of the city into the following districts:
(1)
Agricultural (A-1). The A-1 district is a district for the rural use of land, or a district, which may reflect the existence of vacant land not as yet appropriate for development. This district may be used for residential purposes with a five-acre minimum lot. Farming in this district will be limited to horticultural uses. No livestock or farm animals will be permitted.
(2)
Agricultural (A-2). The A-2 district is a district for the rural use of land, or a district, which may reflect the existence of vacant land not as yet appropriate for development. Residential development will not be permitted or allowed on agricultural land without reclassification to a residential zone. Residential development means changing the use, nature or character of a tract of land under single ownership by construction, preparing land for construction, or moving onto the land more than one dwelling per five acres, except that more than one dwelling per parcel may be allowed on said parcel provided that all dwellings on said parcel are occupied by a parent, child or sibling of the lot owner of record.
(3)
Single-family residential district (R-1). The purpose of this district is to provide single-family residential areas with minimum lot sizes of 12,000 square feet, said areas being protected from the depreciating effects of small lot development and excessive density and from the encroachment of those uses which are incompatible to a desirable residential environment. New residences erected in this district shall be in conformity with and not substandard to the existing homes in their vicinity.
(4)
Single-family residential district (R-2). The purpose of this district is to provide single-family residential areas with minimum lot sizes of 10,000 square feet. This district is designed to accommodate manufactured housing in addition to site built and modular homes.
(5)
Multi-family residential district (R-3). The purpose of this district is to provide orderly development of high-density residential areas for one, two and multi-family dwellings, said areas being protected from the encroachment of those uses which are incompatible to a desirable residential environment.
(6)
Manufactured home community district (R-4). The purpose of the manufactured home community district is to provide areas within the city exclusively for manufactured home residences and for buildings directly related to the operation of the manufactured home community residential area. Manufactured home community residential areas shall be a minimum of three acres with manufactured home spaces of at least 4,000 square feet each. (See section 75-452)
(7)
Local business district (C-1). The purpose of this district shall be to enhance and protect shopping facilities in the local business districts of the city. It is a district primarily for planned shopping centers or limited retail activities designed to serve the surrounding neighborhood with convenience goods, retail services and personal services.
(8)
General commercial district (C-2). The purpose of the general commercial district is to provide for those business activities that are larger users of space than commercial uses serving the central commercial district and the needs of individual neighborhoods and highway business areas. It is a district for general business, storage and limited manufacturing activities, which also includes retail sales and personal services.
(9)
Light industrial district (I-1). The purpose of this district shall be to provide and protect areas for those industrial uses that do not create excessive noise, odor, smoke, dust, and which do not possess other objectionable characteristics that might be detrimental to surrounding neighborhoods, or to the other uses permitted in the district.
(10)
Heavy industrial district (I-2). The purpose of this heavy industrial district is to provide a location for those industrial operations and processes which are not considered nuisances but which have objectionable characteristics that are not injurious to the health, safety, and general welfare of the public.
(11)
Downtown business overlay (DB). The purpose of this overlay is to identify and protect that area that centers on the courthouse square for its unique and/or historic buildings with limited commercial uses.
(12)
Flood hazard overlay (F-H). The purpose of the flood hazard overlay is to identify areas of the city that are identified by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as being subject to periodic flooding; and to limit development in these areas to uses that will be least damaged by flooding. Registered land surveyors must establish boundary limits.

Sec. 75-92. - Designation on maps.
The boundaries of the various zoning districts are shown upon the official zoning maps of the city/county, as they may be amended from time to time and which are hereby made a part of this article and which shall be maintained in the office of the clerk of the board of commissioners by the building inspector as a public document available for public inspection and examination. The official zoning maps shall be those 228 tax parcel/land lot tax maps as shown in the atlas entitled, "The Official Zoning Atlas of Putnam County, Georgia, June 17, 1997," signed by the chairman of the board of commissioners and maintained for public inspection at the clerk's office by the building inspector and which contain land lot, district, parcel and street boundaries located in the city/county; the "Aerial Photo-Sheet Index" map and the "1997 Master Zoning Map of Putnam County"; such maps shall and do also contain the zoning districts and zoning district boundaries. All such official zoning maps and all notations, references, and information shown thereon shall be as much a part of this article as if all the matter and information set forth by the maps were fully described in this section.
(Ord. of 3-20-2006)
Sec. 75-93. - Interpretation of district boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on the official zoning maps, the following rules shall apply:
(1)
Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline or right-of-way line of streets and alleys, land lot lines, militia district lines or lot lines, these lines shall be construed to be these boundaries.
(2)
In un-subdivided property or tracts, where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of these boundaries, unless indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on theses maps.
(3)
Where boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the centerline or right-of-way line of streets, alleys or highways, these boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance there from as indicated on the zoning maps. If no distance is given, this dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the maps.
(4)
In case any further uncertainty exists, the city council shall determine the location of boundaries as a request for interpretation and only after public hearing as per the policies and procedures set forth in division 2 of article II of this chapter.
