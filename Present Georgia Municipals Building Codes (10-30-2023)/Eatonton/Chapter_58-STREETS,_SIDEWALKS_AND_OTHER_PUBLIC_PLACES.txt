For the purpose of controlling traffic and pedestrian congestion and of providing for the public health, safety and general welfare, the following regulations shall pertain to all parades conducted within the city:
(1)
All parades shall form on S. Washington Street in the block between W. Walnut Street and Oak Street; thence, proceed north along Oak Street through its intersection with S. Jefferson Street; then, travel along N. Jefferson Street to Wayne Street and turn west on Wayne Street to N. Madison turning south to Marion turning west to Washington turning south traveling back to the point of origin to disband, at which point the parade shall terminate. Parades may follow a shorter distance along this route with express written approval of the chief of police. Buses and other vehicles used to transport participants to the formation site shall be moved to the point where the parade is to disband before the parade starts. To the extent the owners of commercial properties at or near the forming and disbanding points give the parade sponsor their written consent, parades should be lined up or formed, and disband, off the public street and sidewalk so as not to impede the free movement of motor vehicles and pedestrians. The normal route of the parade may be reversed if the chief of police finds it in the best interest of the safety of participants and spectators. Other routes may be approved by the city council.
(2)
Parades shall be conducted on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and legal holidays only, between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. and the hours of 1:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m., and on Sundays between the hours of 1:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m., provided the city council may approve such other times as requested by the sponsor of a parade. Parade sponsors are encouraged to schedule parades at those times which create the least interference with traffic and pedestrian movement along the parade route and its intersecting streets. Notice of previously scheduled events or assemblies within the downtown area shall be sufficient cause for the chief of police to deny issuance of a permit during a conflicting time period; provided, the sponsor shall be permitted to conduct its parade at a nonconflicting time.
(3)
All parade participants shall assemble for the parade at the location designated in the permit. Participants entering upon private property without permission of the owner may be charged as trespassers.
(4)
No parade participant or spectator shall carry firearms, knives, or weapons of any character while engaged or participating in a public assembly, parade or gathering.
(5)
All materials used in the construction of floats or other mobile displays shall be fire-resistant and shall be subject to inspection for compliance with fire safety requirements by the city fire chief.
(6)
Once commenced, a parade shall not stop along the parade route, but shall continue to move at a fixed rate of speed. Any willful delay or stopping, except where reasonably required for the safe and orderly conduct of the parade, shall constitute a violation of the permit.
(7)
To prevent the risk of injury to persons, no objects shall be thrown from floats or vehicles in the parade. Individually wrapped pieces of candy, literature, or other objects of a nature not likely to cause physical injury may be handed out to spectators by participants walking the parade route, if done in such manner as to be away from the roadway so as not to cause injury. Literature, publications, flyers, leaflets or other written materials of a commercial nature shall not be distributed during a parade. No objects may be thrown by spectators into the parade route or at parade participants.
(8)
Parade participants shall not engage in speeches during the parade, but may make speeches and distribute literature at rallies and similar gatherings conducted after the conclusion of a parade, if suitable arrangements have been made for a location off the public street and sidewalks of the city.
(9)
Drivers of motor vehicles, whether or not required by law to be tagged or titled, shall operate their vehicles in accordance with the Uniform Rules of the Road, as adopted by city ordinance, while participating in a parade or funeral procession. Any driver who operates their vehicle in an unsafe manner, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 40-6-251, may be cited accordingly. Drivers of parade vehicles shall follow the lawful commands and instructions of police officers at all times.
(10)
Where barricades, ropes, tape or similar devices are used to demarcate the limits of the parade route, spectators shall remain within these defined spectator areas. Spectators shall not cross the parade route between floats and vehicles while the parade is in progress or in such manner as to interfere with its progress.
(11)
It shall be the duty of every parade sponsor to whom a permit is issued under this article to familiarize all participants, either orally or by written notice, of the terms and conditions of the permit and these regulations prior to commencement of the parade. Every participant shall, in advance of participating, sign a statement acknowledging that he has been so advised by the permittee, understands and will comply with the regulations, terms and conditions of the permit. Where a group participates or enters the parade, the participant shall designate, in writing, to the parade sponsor an individual of adult age who shall be physically present and responsible for his group.
(b)
All parades shall be held and strictly governed by the regulations in this section and any special conditions set forth as terms and conditions of the specific parade permit. Any violation or material departure from these regulations, without the express written consent of the chief of police, shall be sufficient grounds for the police officers of the city to immediately stop the parade and direct it to immediately disband.
(c)
Any person knowingly violating the regulations in this section, or the terms and conditions of any permit issued pursuant to this article shall be cited to appear before the municipal court. Upon conviction, any person found to have violated this article shall be punished as set forth in section 1-12. Conviction for a violation of this article shall be sufficient grounds for denial of a future parade permit to such person.

Sec. 58-69. - Identification of funeral processions.
No permit shall be required for a funeral procession; provided, however, a funeral procession composed of motor vehicles shall be clearly identified by lighted headlights or other appropriate markings on the vehicles as designated by the chief of police. Funeral directors shall notify the police department of the approximate time and route of the funeral procession in order that an escort or other necessary arrangements can be made to prevent disruption of the orderly flow of traffic.
(Ord. of 2-20-2006(4))
Sec. 58-70. - Driving through parades and processions.
