Sec. 75-504. - Computations.
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height:
(1)
Computations of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, or triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblems, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself. In the case of a freestanding sign, this area shall include not only the sign face as described above, but also the area of the sign structure that is flat, contiguous thereto, and which comprises the framework or decorative background for the sign.
(2)
Computation of area of multifaced signs. The sign area for the sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same structure and are not more than 48 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
(3)
Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the normal grade at the base of the sign to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of the existing grade prior to construction or the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is lower.
(4)
Computation of maximum total permitted sign area for a zone lot. The permitted area of all individual signs on a zone lot shall be computed by applying the standards contained in the appendices which are at the end of this article and which pertain to the various zoning districts in the city. The maximum area for freestanding signs shall be dependent in part on the road frontage of the zone lot in which such sign is located. Lots fronting on two or more arterial streets shall be allowed to allocated the permitted sign area to each street frontage, without increasing the total sign area allowed. When multiple freestanding signs are erected on a single zone lot under this provision, each shall be placed at the midpoint of the applicable road frontage.
(Ord. of 3-20-2006)
Sec. 75-505. - Signs allowed on private property.
Signs shall be allowed on private property in the city only in accordance with Appendices B through I, which are located at the end of this article and which pertain to the various zoning districts in the city.
(1)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, no person shall erect a sign of any type on any zone lot unless there is located on said lot a building with an area of 1,000 square feet or more unless said sign is exempt from the requirement of obtaining a permit pursuant to section 75-514.
(2)
New signage along the Scenic Byway (State Route 16) shall be regulated by the Georgia Department of Transportation (D.O.T.) regarding new signage along a scenic byway.
(Ord. of 3-20-2006)
Sec. 75-506. - Sign permit required.
(1)
If a sign requiring a permit under the provisions of this article is to be placed, constructed, erected, or modified on a zone lot, the owner of the lot shall obtain a sign permit prior to the construction, placement, erection, or modification of such a sign in accordance with the requirements of section 75-513. Furthermore, the property owner shall maintain, at all times, a sign permit for such sign in accordance with sections 75-514, 75-515, or 75-516. No sign shall be erected in the public right-of-way except in accordance with section 75-509 and the permit requirements of section 75-516. No sign permit of any kind shall be issued for a proposed sign unless such sign is consistent with the requirements of this article (including those protecting existing signs) in every respect and with the master signage plan in effect for the property.
(2)
All signs located within 660 feet of a state or federal highway must apply for a permit from the Georgia Department of Transportation before a permit can be issued by planning and development.
(3)
Signs located inside the corporate limits of a municipality cannot be placed within 100 feet of each other unless signs are separated by buildings so that only one sign face within the 100-foot zone is visible from the highway at any on time.
(Ord. of 3-20-2006)
Sec. 75-507. - Design, construction, and maintenance.
All signs shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the following standards:
(1)
All signs shall comply with applicable provisions of "the state minimum standard codes" as defined in O.C.G.A. § 8-2-20.
(2)
Except for banners, flags, temporary signs, and window signs conforming in all respects with the requirements of this article, all signs shall be constructed of permanent material and shall be permanently attached to the ground, a building, or another structure by direct attachment to a rigid wall, frame, or structure.
(3)
All signs shall be maintained in good structural condition, in compliance with all building and electrical codes, and in conformance with this Code, at all times as well as be in compliance with any structural requirements. For larger signs, a structural integrity inspection is recommended every three to five years or more frequent as standard practice dictate. So as to maintain a clean and attractive cityscape, all signs that have deteriorated or are in general disrepair or damaged must be repaired, replaced, or removed. A citation may be issued for all such signs. A sign must then be replaced or repaired within 90 days of notice to avoid penalties as stated in section 75-520.
(Ord. of 3-20-2006)
Sec. 75-508. - Master signage plan.

The master signage plan for all zone lots with multiple uses or multiple users shall limit the number of freestanding signs to a total of one for each street on which the zone lots have frontage and shall provide for shared or common usage of such signs.

(7)
Binding effect. After approval of a master signage plan, no sign shall be erected, placed, painted, or maintained, except in conformance with such plan, and such plan may be enforced in the same way as any other provision of this article. In case of any conflict of interest between the provisions of such a plan and any provision of this article, this article shall control.
