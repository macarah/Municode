(Ord. of 3-20-2006)
Sec. 75-715. - Tree and site related disturbances.
(1)
Tree protection zones, specimen trees or stands of trees designated to be saved must be protected from the following damages which may occur during all phases of land disturbance and construction processes. Methods of tree protection and disturbance prevention are provided in section 75-716.
(a)
Direct physical root damage.
(b)
Indirect root damage.
(c)
Trunk and crown disturbances.
(2)
Direct physical root damage most frequently occurs during site clearing and grading operations, where transport or feeder roots are cut, torn, or removed.
(a)
Transport and feeder roots tend to tangle and fuse among the roots of adjacent trees. The removal of trees with heavy machinery along the outer periphery of a tree save area can result in considerable damage within the tree save area.
(b)
The most substantial form of root damage for all root types occurs in the form of cut roots. Roots are cut in grade reduction, or from trenching for underground utilities, sanitary sewer, or storm sewer lines.
(c)
A more subtle form of root damage is the loss of feeder roots. Feeder roots normally occur within the organic layer, and the surface four inches of topsoil, subsequently, these roots can be easily damaged by the track action from a single bulldozer pass. The stripping of topsoil within a tree's critical root zone can totally eliminate its feeder root system.
(3)
Indirect root damage through site modification can result from positive grade changes, temporary storage or fill material, the sedimentation of erosion materials, soil compaction, and soil chemical changes.
(a)
Positive grade changes from fill and sedimentation causes a decrease in soil oxygen levels. An increase in soil carbon dioxide and other toxic gases can also occur, leading to large areas of anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic soil conditions cause a decrease in the root respiration process that is essential for the uptake and transport or minerals and nutrients.
(b)
Anaerobic soil conditions are also produced by soil impaction, the increase in soil bulk density with a decrease in soil pore space. Compacted soil is also impervious to root penetration, and thus inhibits root development. Soil compaction is generally caused by the weight and vibrations of heavy machinery, vehicle parking, and the storage of fill and/or construction materials within the critical root zones of trees.
(c)
Changes in soil chemistry will adversely affect tree survival. The most frequent occurrence is the change (decrease) in soil acidity by concrete washout. Most trees native to the city area prefer slightly acid soils; concrete residues are highly basic. The leakage or spillage of toxic materials such as fuels or paints can be fatal for trees.
(4)
Trunk and crown disturbances are generally mechanical in nature and are either caused directly by clearing and grading machinery, or indirectly by debris being cleared and falling into trees marked for protection.
(a)
Common forms of damages include stripped bark and cambium, split trunks, and broken limbs.
(b)
Damage also occurs from the posting of signs as building permits, or survey markers on trees.
(c)
Indirect damage can be caused by the placement of burn holes or debris fires too close to trees. The possible range of damages include scorched trunks with some cambiall dieback, the loss of foliage due to evaporative heat stress (leaf desiccation), and completely burned trunks and crowns.
(Ord. of 3-20-2006)
Sec. 75-716. - Methods of tree protection.
(1)
Planning considerations. Tree space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the development process. The root system of trees can easily extend beyond the drip line of the tree canopy. The root system within the drip-line region is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Disturbance within this zone can directly affect a tree's chances for survival. To protect these critical root zones the following standards shall apply:
(a)
The use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged rather than the protection of individual (non-specimen) trees scattered throughout a site. This will facilitate ease in overall site organization as related to tree protection.
(b)
The protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees or otherwise designated tree save areas shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree(s) canopy as defined by the farthest canopy drip line of the tree(s). In some instances, the planning and development department may require a protective zone in excess of the area defined by the tree's drip-line.
(c)
Layout of the project site utility and grading plans should accommodate the required tree protective zones. Utilities must be placed along corridors between tree protective zones.
(d)
Construction site activities such as parking, material storage, concrete washout, burn hole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protective zones.
(e)
No disturbance shall occur within the protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees without prior approval by the planning and development department.
(f)
No tree shall be planted close to a building foundation, water line, sewer line, electrical line or natural gas line as follows:
1.
Five feet for a mature small tree.
2.
Ten feet for a mature medium tree.
3.
Fifteen feet for a mature large tree.
4.
No trees shall be planted under overhead utility cable lines if the average mature height of the tree is greater than the lowest overhead wire.
(2)
Protective barriers.
(a)
Active protective tree fencing shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely surrounding the critical root zones of all specimen trees or stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones, prior to any land disturbance.
(b)
These fences will be a minimum four feet high, constructed in a post and rail configuration. A two-inch by four-inch post and a double one-inch by four-inch rail is recommended. Four-foot orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing is also acceptable.
(c)
Passive forms of tree protection may be utilized to delineate tree save areas that are remote from areas of land disturbance. These areas must be completely surrounded with continuous rope or flagging (heavy mill, minimum four inches wide). All passive tree protection must be accompanied by "Keep Out" or "Tree Save" signage.
(d)
All tree protection zones should be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are recommended for site entrances.
(e)
All specimen trees or stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones must be protected from the sedimentation of erosion material.
1.
Silt screening must be placed along the outer uphill edge of tree protective zones at the land disturbance interface.
2.
Silt screening should be backed by 12-gauge two-inch by four-inch wire mesh fencing in areas of steep slope.
3.
All erosion control must comply with the City of Eatonton Erosion Control Standards.
(f)
All tree fencing and erosion control barriers must be installed prior to and maintained throughout land disturbance process and building construction, and should not be removed until landscaping is installed.
(3)
Encroachment. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. If encroachment is anticipated within the critical root zones of specimen trees, stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones, the following preventive measures shall be employed:
(a)
Clearing activities: Roots often fuse and tangle amongst trees. The removal of trees adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Wherever possible, it is advisable to cut minimum two-foot trenches (e.g. with a "ditch-witch") along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, roots. Trenching may be required for the protection of specimen trees.
(b)
Soil compaction: Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials storage, the tree protective zone must first be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of processed pine bark or wood chips, or a six-inch layer of pine straw.
(c)
Trenching: The installation of utilities through a protective zone should occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching. If roots must be cut, proper root pruning procedures must be employed.
(d)
Grade changes: Moderate fill can be tolerated within a tree's critical root zone with the prior installation of an aeration system. Commercially available aeration systems are subject to approval by the planning and development department. A decrease in grade is best accomplished with the use of retaining walls or through terracing.
(e)
Where the planning and development department has determined that irreparable damage has occurred to trees within tree protective zones, the trees must be removed and replaced.
(4)
Remedial procedures. Remedial site reclamation and tree care procedures shall be implemented when encroachment within protective zones has caused damage to either the tree or the tree's growing site, and that damage is reparable.
(Ord. of 3-20-2006)
Sec. 75-717. - Re-vegetation.
(1)
Tree replacement.
(a)
The replacement of trees in the minimum required landscape areas, as determined by this article, must occur under the following conditions:
1.
To establish the minimum tree density requirements for the site.
2.
Where grading occurs outside the buildable area of the lot.
3.
If the lot's buildable area leaves no protected zone.
4.
If no trees are present within an existing protected zone.
5.
Where specimen trees or stands of trees within the buildable portion of the lot are to be removed.
6.
Where specimen trees or stands of trees, and trees within otherwise designated tree protective zones have been irreparably damaged or removed through land disturbance or construction activities.
(b)
The quantity of replacement trees into a site must be sufficient so as to produce a total site-tree density factor of no less than 15 units per acre. (Note: The terms unit and tree are not interchangeable.) Procedures for determining the site density requirements and the subsequent tree replacement requirements are provided in Appendix B.
(c)
The spacing of replacement trees must be compatible with spatial limitations, and with responsible considerations towards potential species size.
(d)
Where the planning and development department has determined that site spatial constraints result in an absolute inability to provide tree density, as many trees as possible must be planted on site. The remaining balance of required trees must be provided for planting on public properties. Tree bank arrangements will be made through the planning and development department.
(e)
Species selected for replacement must be quality specimens, and must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing site. Standards for transplanting, and selecting quality replacement stock, are provided in Appendix C.
(f)
Specimen trees and stands of trees must be replaced by species with potentials for comparable size and quality. Tree replacement in addition to the minimum site tree density may be required in recompense for the removal of specimen trees.
(g)
Species selection and replacement densities are subject to approval by the planning and development department.
(Ord. of 3-20-2006)
Sec. 75-718. - Appendices A through F.
Appendix A. Technical terms.
(1)
Cambium. Tissue within the woody portion of trees and shrubs which gives rise to the woody water and nutrient conducting system, and the energy substrate transport system in trees. Cambium growth activity results in a tree's radial development, i.e., increase in diameter.
(2)
Cambial dieback. The irreparable radial or vertical interruption of a tree's cambium, usually caused by mechanical damage, such as "skinning bark" or from excessive heat.
(3)
Coniferous. Belonging to the group of cone-bearing evergreen trees or shrubs.
(4)
Critical root zone. The rooting area of a tree established to limit root disturbances. This zone is generally defined as a circle with a radius extending from a tree's trunk to a point no less that the furthest crown drip line. Disturbances within this zone will directly affect a tree's chance for survival.
(5)
Deciduous. Not persistent; the shedding of leaves annually.
(6)
Feeder roots. A complex system of small annual roots growing outward and predominantly upward from the system of "transport roots". These roots branch four or more times to form fans or mats of thousands of fine, short, non-woody tips. Many of these small roots and their multiple tips are 0.2 to 1 mm or less in diameter, and less than 1 to 2 mm long. These roots constitute the major fraction of a tree's root system surface area, and are the primary sites of absorption of water and nutrients.
(7)
Major woody roots. First order tree roots, originating at the "root collar" and growing horizontally in the soil to a distance of between three and 15 feet from the tree's trunk. These roots branch and decrease in diameter to give rise to "rope roots". The primary function of major woody roots includes anchorage, structural support, the storage of food reserves, and the transport of minerals and nutrients.
(8)
Root collar. The point of attachment of major woody roots to the tree trunk, usually at or near the ground-line and associated with a marked swelling of the tree trunk.
(9)
Root respiration. An active process occurring throughout the feeder root system of trees, and involving the consumption of oxygen and sugars with the release of energy and carbon dioxide. Root respiration facilitates the uptake and transport of minerals and nutrients essential for tree survival.
(10)
Rope roots. An extensive network of woody second order roots arising from major woody roots, occurring within the surface 12 to 18 inches of local soils, and with an average size ranging from .25 to one-inch in diameter. The primary function or rope roots is the transport of water and nutrients, and the storage of food reserves.
(11)
Soil compaction. A change in soil physical properties that includes an increase in soil weight per unit volume, and a decrease in soil pore space. Soil compaction is caused by repeated vibrations, frequent traffic and weight. As related to tree roots, compacted soil can cause physical root damage, a decrease in soil oxygen levels with an increase in toxic gasses, and can be impervious to new root development.
(12)
Transport roots. The system or framework of tree roots comprised of major woody roots and rope roots.
Appendix B. Procedure for calculating the required tree replacement density factor. (Ref. section 75-717(1)(b) and TABLE 1.)
Step 1. Calculate the required density factor for the site (RDFS) by multiplying the number of site acres by 15.
EXAMPLE: A 2.2 acre site has a DFS of 2.2 x 15 = 33.
Step 2. Calculate the existing density factor (EDF) of trees that will remain on site to be protected during construction. EDF is determined by converting the DBH of individual existing trees to density factor units, using Table 2. These units are then totaled to determine the EDF for the site.
EXAMPLE: A total of 15 trees will remain on the 2.2 acre site in Step 1. These trees include:
7—12-inch pines
3—14-inch pines
3—18-inch oaks
1—20-inch hickory
1—30-inch oak
When converted to density factor units using Table 3, we arrive at the following values:
EXPAND
DBH UNITS# TREES
12" .8x7 =5.6
14" 1.1x3=3.3
18" 1.8x3=5.4
20" 2.2x1=2.2
30" 4.9x1=4.9
21.4
  The sum total of units, 21.4, is the EDF.
Step 3. Calculate the required replacement density (RDF) by subtracting the EDF (Step 2) from the DFS (Step 1). RDF = DFS - EDF
Example: RDF = 33 - 21.4
RDF = 11.6
Step 4. The RDF can be converted back to caliper inches using Table 3. Any number or combination of transplantable size trees can be used so long as their total density factor units will equal or exceed the RDF.
Example: On the 2.2 acre site the following number and size of trees will be planted:
EXPAND
NUMBER SIZE SPECIES DENSITY FATOR
12 1" Pines (12X.4) = 4.8
10 2" Red Maples (10X.5) = 5.0
2 6" Oaks (2X1.0) = 2.0
11.8
  11.8 is greater than the RDF of 11.6 thus the minimum requirements (Subsection 75-717(1)(b)) have been met.

Appendix C. Standards for selecting quality replacement stock.
(1)
Trees selected for planting must meet the minimum requirements as provided in the "American Standard for Nursery Stock", (ANSI Z60.1, 1980).
(2)
Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, or nutritional disorders.
(3)
Trees selected for planting must be of good vigor. The determination of vigor is a subjective evaluation, and dependent upon species variability. The following criteria is generally used for the determination of vigor:
(a)
Foliage should have a green or dark green color. Vigorous trees will have large leaves and dense foliage when compared to trees with poor vigor.
(b)
Shoot growth for most vigorous trees will be at least one foot per year. At least one-half of the branches should arise from points on the lower two-thirds of a trunk.
(c)
Bark texture can denote vigor. Smooth or shiny bark on the trunk and branches of a young tree usually signifies good vigor, conversely, rough and dull bark could indicate poor vigor.
(d)
Trunk taper. The trunks of vigorous trees will generally have an increase in diameter with a decrease in height. Trees with reverse tapers or no taper should be avoided.
(e)
Root color. Young roots of most trees will be light in color.
(4)
Trees selected for planting must be free of root defects. Two types of root defects generally occur:
(a)
Kinked roots, in which taproots, major branch roots, or both are bent more than 90 degrees with less than 20 percent of the root system originating above the kink. A tree with such roots will probably bend at the soil line when released from a supporting stake.
(b)
Circling or girdling roots which circle 80 percent or more of the root system by 360 degrees or more. A tree with such roots would ultimately have less than 20 percent of its system available for support.

Appendix D. Landscape strip and buffer standards.
(1)
Landscape strips/islands.
(a)
The width of landscape strip must as a minimum, must be such that a five-foot diameter circle fit inside and be at least 50 square feet.
(b)
The following permanent structures are not permitted within landscape strips: pavement, retaining walls, curbing, dumpsters, or major utility boxes.
(c)
Curb stops must be used to prevent vehicle overhang into required landscape strips and parking islands.
(d)
Signs within required landscape strips are to be approved by the planning and development department. These signs may only be located in areas of turf or groundcover, and must not conflict with the growth potential of trees and shrubs. Signs are not permitted within required undisturbed buffers.
(e)
The deposition of storm water runoff into, or drainage swales through landscape strips is generally not permitted. Exceptions will be considered only if this standard will create an undue hardship to the property owner. Under no circumstances may the length of a drainage easement through a landscape strip exceed the width of the strip.
(f)
Parking lot landscape islands must, as a minimum, be planted with at least one shade tree for every 20 linear feet. All other landscape standards apply.
(g)
When fencing is required as a condition of rezoning, the finished surface of the fence must face externally to the project. The fence or wall must be located interior to the landscape strip or buffer such that the strip is outside of the enclosed area.
(h)
All species within required landscape strips must be ecologically compatible with the intended growing site. Ornamental trees may not be used to satisfy tree density requirements. All plant materials are subject to approval of the planning and development department.
(i)
Trees within required landscape strips shall be provided as follows:
1.
Landscape strips 25 feet wide or less; a minimum of one tree for every 30 linear feet of landscape strip.
2.
Landscape strips greater than 25 feet wide; a minimum of one tree for every 20 linear feet of landscape strip.
3.
Clumping is permitted.
(j)
All required landscape strips must be designated with at least 60 percent coverage in trees and shrubs, and no more than 40 percent coverage in grass and ground cover. Landscape strip coverage will be calculated as follows:
1.
Calculate the total spatial area of the landscape strip.
2.
Count the number of trees within the landscape strip and multiply by 50 square feet for trees less than six-inch caliper and 100 square for trees six-inch in caliper or greater. (This will allow some credit for the spatial coverage of the tree canopy).
3.
Calculate the coverage provided by the shrubs: shrubs planted three feet on center equal nine square feet of coverage; shrubs planted four feet on center equal 16 square feet of coverage; shrubs planted five feet on center equal 25 square feet of coverage. Shrub species and spacing is subject to approval of the planning and development department.
4.
Grass may not exceed 40 percent coverage within the strip.
(k)
The total area of all islands shall comprise at least five percent of parking lot area in commercial, office/institutional, residential and industrial zoning districts' plus one percent of other vehicle use area on the property such as loading, storage, or display area.
(2)
Planting within right-of-ways. Approval from the planning and development department (and D.O.T. where applicable) is required as planting is generally not permitted in the right-of-way. Where approval is received, the following conditions must be met:
(a)
Indemnification and maintenance agreements must be recorded with the city city clerk, prior to permitting irrigation or plantings within city right-of-ways.
1.
These agreements must be recorded in the name of a homeowner's association (along with documentation attesting to that association's existence), for subdivisions.
2.
These agreements must be recorded in the property owner's name for all other types of projects.
(b)
Trees planted within rights-of-way cannot be counted towards the tree density requirement for a site, unless otherwise approved by the planning and development department.
(3)
Buffers.
(a)
Required undisturbed buffers must remain undisturbed, and actively protected (under the auspices of article VIII - Tree Preservation Regulations), except where otherwise stipulated in conditions of rezoning.
(b)
Buffers must be replanted where sparsely vegetated or where disturbed for approved access and approved utility crossings, to meet the following standards:
1.
Must provide a 100 percent visual barrier to a height of six feet within two years of planting. To accomplish this screening, the plant materials must be a minimum three and one-half to four feet in height at time of planting, moderately growing, and evergreen. Slower growing trees may be used if larger materials are planted. All buffer plant materials are subject to approval of the planning and development department.
2.
The number of planting rows for trees replacement in buffers is determined by the buffer width.
Buffer Width Minimum Planting Rows
< 20' 2
20' to 30' 3
31' to 50' 4
> 50' 4 plus 1 row for each additional 15 feet.
  (c)
Drainage within or through buffers is subject to the approval of the planning and development department.
(d)
Encroachment into buffers for the construction of retaining walls footings, or wall supports is not permitted unless otherwise specified in the conditions of rezoning, all encroachments into buffers require zoning modifications.
(e)
A ten-foot improvement setback is required interior to all buffers. Clearing and grading are only permitted within that setback.
Appendix E. Checklist for landscaping/tree protection plan review
