(b)
Policy.
(1)
No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by state/provincial laws and regulations and this article. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow-prevention assembly required by this article is not installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow-prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such condition or defects are corrected.
(2)
The customer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the water superintendent to determine whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the water superintendent shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with state/provincial and city statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
(3)
An approved backflow-prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served; but in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist:
a.
In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply that is not or may not be safe bacteriological or chemical quality and that is not acceptable as an additional source by the water superintendent, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the decree of hazard.
b.
In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system that have been subject to deterioration in quality.
c.
In the case of premises having (1) internal cross-connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or (2) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line.
(4)
The type of protective assembly required under subsections (3)a through (3)c above shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as follows:
a.
In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in subsection (3)a above and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principal backflow-prevention assembly.
b.
In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly.
c.
In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and plating plants.
d.
In the case of any premises where there are "uncontrolled" cross-connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly at the service connection.
e.
In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly on each service to the premise.
f.
In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the water superintendent, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely toxic substances, the water superintendent may require an air gap at the service connection to protect the public water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the water superintendent and is dependent on the degree of hazard.
(5)
Any backflow-prevention assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the water superintendent. The term approved backflow-prevention assembly shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association titled ANSI/AWWA C510-89—Standard for Double Check Value Backflow-Prevention Assembly, and AWWA C511-89—Standard for Reduced-Pressure Principle Backflow-Prevention Assembly, and have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research (FCCCHR) of the University of Southern California established by "Specification of Backflow-Prevention Assemblies", Sec. 10 of the most current issue of the Manual of Cross-Connection Control.
Said AWWA and FCCCHR standards and specifications have been adopted by the water superintendent. Final approval shall be evidenced by a certificate of approval issued by an approved testing laboratory certifying full compliance with said AWWA standards and FCCCHR specification.
The following testing laboratory has bee qualified by the water superintendent to test and certify backflow preventers: Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research, University of Southern California, University Park, Los Angeles, CA 90089.
Testing laboratories, other than the laboratory listed above, will be added to an approved list as they are qualified that may be subjected to backpressure or backsiphonage that have been fully tested and have been granted a certificate of approval by said qualified by the water superintendent.
Backflow preventers that may be subjected to backpressure or backsiphonage that have been fully tested and have been granted a certificate of approval by said qualified laboratory and are listed on the laboratory's current list of approved backflow-prevention assemblies may be used without further testing or qualification.
(6)
It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where backflow-prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least one per year. In those instances where the water superintendent deems the hazard to be great enough, certified inspections may be required at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by the assembly manufacturer's representative, water department personnel, or by a certified tester approved by the water superintendent. It shall be the duty of the water superintendent to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The customer-user shall notify the water superintendent in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that the customer-user may witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be kept and made available to the water superintendent.
(7)
All presently installed backflow-prevention assemblies that do not meet the requirements of this section but where approved assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance under subsection (6) above, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the water superintendent is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location, requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the water superintendent finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow-prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section.

Secs. 70-104—70-109. - Reserved.
ARTICLE IV. - FATS OILS AND GREASE (FOG)

Sec. 70-110. - Purpose, short title and definitions.
(1)
Purpose and short title. The short title of this article is the Fats Oils and Grease Ordinance (FOG). The purpose of this article is to control discharges into the public sewerage collection system and wastewater treatment plant that interfere with the operations of the system, cause blockage and plugging of pipelines, interfere with normal operation of pumps and their controls, and contribute waste of a strength or form that either causes treatment difficulties or is beyond the treatment capability of the wastewater treatment plant.
(2)
Definitions.
Food service facilities. Those establishments primarily engaged in activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for consumption foodstuffs and that use one or more of the following preparation activities: cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling, sauteing, rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching, roasting, toasting, or poaching.
Also included are [infrared] heating, searing, barbecuing, and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot, non-drinkable food product in or on a receptacle that requires washing. These facilities include restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, grocery stores, prisons, jails, churches, camps, caterers, manufacturing plants, or any other sewer users as determined by the Eatonton Putnam Water and Sewer Authority who discharge applicable waste.
Grease. Material composed primarily of fats, oil, and grease (FOG) from animal or vegetable sources. The terms fats, oil, and, grease shall be deemed as grease by definition. Grease does not include petroleum based products.
Grease trap. A device for separating and retaining waterborne greases and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. These devices also serve to collect settleable solids, generated by and from food preparation activities, prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system.
Oil/water separator. An approved and industry standard system that is specifically designed and manufactured to separate oil from water. The system shall allow the oil to be collected and removed on a regular basis as to prevent it from being discharged into the wastewater collection system. Only oil/water separators manufactured for that specific operation will be approved. Adequate support literature from the manufacturer will be required so as to allow a proper review by the EPWSA personnel.
User. Any person or establishment including those located outside the jurisdictional limits of the city who contributes, causes, or permits the contribution or discharge of wastewater into the Eatonton Putnam Water and Sewer Authority's wastewater collection or treatment system, including persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater.
(Res. of 3-19-2012)
Sec. 70-111. - Control plan for FOG and food waste.
(a)
Any new construction, renovation, or expansion of food service facilities shall be required to submit to EPWSA a FOG and food waste control plan that will effectively control the discharge of undesirable materials into the wastewater collection system.
(b)
Any existing food service facilities shall also be required to submit a FOG and food waste control plan that will effectively control the discharge of undesirable materials into the wastewater collection system. Existing facilities shall not be exempt from the requirements of this article. There will be no "Grandfathering".
(c)
General control criteria.
(1)
Installation requirements. All existing, proposed, or newly remodeled Food service facilities inside the EPWSA wastewater service area shall be required to install, at the user's expense an approved, properly operated and maintained grease trap.

Sanitary sewer flows. Sanitary sewer flows from toilets, urinals, lavatories, etc. shall not be discharged into the grease trap. These flows shall be conveyed separately to the sanitary sewer service lateral.
(3)
Floor drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease trap.
(4)
Garbage grinders/disposers. It is recommended that solid food waste products be disposed of through normal solid waste/garbage disposal means. If a grinder/disposal is used it must be connected to the grease trap. The use of grinders is discouraged since it decreases the operational capacity of the grease trap and will require an increased pumping frequency to ensure continuous and effective operation.
(5)
Dishwashers. Commercial dishwashers must be connected to the grease trap. Dishwashers discharge soap and hot water which can melt grease and allow it to pass through an undersized grease trap. Traps must be sized accordingly to allow enough detention time to allow water to cool and grease to solidify and float to the top of the trap.
(6)
Location. Grease trap shall be installed outside the building upstream from the sanitary sewer service lateral connection. This will allow easy access for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at any time. A grease trap may not be installed inside any part of a building without written approval by the EPWSA.
(7)
Pass through limits. No user shall allow wastewater discharge concentration from grease trap to exceed 100 MgPL (milligrams per liter) as identified by EPA method 413.
(Res. of 3-19-2012)
Sec. 70-112. - Design criteria.
(a)
Construction. Grease traps shall be constructed in accordance with EPWSA's standards and shall have a minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All grease removal devises or technologies shall be subject to the written approval of the EPWSA. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed technology.
