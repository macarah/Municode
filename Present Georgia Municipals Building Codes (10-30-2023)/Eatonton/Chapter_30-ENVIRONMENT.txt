Sec. 30-103. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed or maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16), and (17) of this section, [in] light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments onsite or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section;
(15)
Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) and (17) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, O.C.G.A., the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and an aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured form the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(17)
There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 or Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to Code section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to Code section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulk heads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water-detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction.
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
c.
The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
d.
Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01 (r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
(e)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
(Amd. of 6-21-2010; Res. of 11-19-2018, Exh. A)
Sec. 30-104. - Application/permit process.
(a)
Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules and regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.
(b)
Application requirements.
(1)
No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the county planning and development department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable.
(2)
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the county planning and development department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 30-103(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7.10.
(3)
Local permitting fees shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area based on the chart below.
Land Disturbance Permit Application Fee Schedule
EXPAND
1—5 acres $100.00 per disturbed acre
5.1—10 acres $60.00 per disturbed acre
10.1 + acres $20.00 per disturbed acre
  Examples:
1. For 14 acres of disturbed land the fee is calculated as such:
5 × ($100.00) + 5 × ($60.00) + 4 × ($20.00) = $880.00
2. For 7 acres of disturbed land the fee is calculated as such:
5 × ($100.00) + 2 × ($60.00) = $620.00
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(4)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 30-103(c)(15), (16), and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
(5)
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
(6)
The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond, in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof, to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.
(c)
Plan requirements.
(1)
Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 30-103(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices.

Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken.
(2)
No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 30-103(c)(15), (16), and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
(3)
Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority.
(4)
If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase.
(5)
The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit.
(6)
The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).
(Amd. of 6-21-2010; Res. of 11-19-2018, Exh. A)
Sec. 30-105. - Inspection and enforcement.
(a)
The county planning and development department shall periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state a time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.
(b)
The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
(c)
The county planning and development department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as may be necessary to carry out his duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
(d)
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
(e)
The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found.
(f)
The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.
(Amd. of 6-21-2010)
Sec. 30-106. - Penalties and incentives.
(a)
Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority.
(b)
Stop-work orders.
(1)
For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning.
(2)
For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and
(3)
All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred.
(4)
When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.
(c)
Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 30-104(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
(d)
Civil monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil monetary penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of its ordinance, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

(Ord. of 1-21-2003(1); Ord. of 3-7-2006(2))
Sec. 30-169. - Groundwater recharge area protection district.
Groundwater recharge areas are vulnerable to residential and commercial development activities and agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste, and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually causes an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in groundwater recharge areas can alter or impair the recharge characteristics thereby decreasing the groundwater supplies.
(1)
District delineation. The groundwater recharge area districts in the City of Eatonton, Putnam County are shown on and identified as such on the Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18 (Current Edition), as supplemented by the City of Eatonton, Putnam County Groundwater Recharge Areas Map". At the time of adoption of this article, all of Putnam County has been designated as an area with low pollution susceptibility on the Department of Natural Resources Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20.
(2)
Limitations on land use. In addition to the provisions of the zoning ordinance, limitations on land use within groundwater recharge areas shall be as follows:
a.
There shall be no landfills.
b.
There shall be no new permits for the land disposal of hazardous waste.
c.
Facilities permitted or to be permitted to treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste shall perform such operations on an impermeable pad having a spill and leak collection system.
d.
New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons or more, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt provided they comply with all federal requirements.
e.
New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within:
1.
A high pollution susceptibility area;
2.
A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet in capacity; or
3.
A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet in capacity.
Any liner required by this subsection shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of at least one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5×10- 7 cm/sec or other criteria established by U.S. Soil Conservation Service. The average size of existing agricultural waste impoundments in Putnam County is about 15 acre-feet. The recommended vertical hydraulic conductivity in clay can be compacted by the use of sheep's-foot rollers or pans with heavy rubber tires.
f.
New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on Table MT-1 of the Department of Human Resources Manual for on-site sewage management systems DHR Table MT-1). These minimum lot sizes may be increased based on consideration of other factors as set out in sections A—F of the DHR manual.
1.
One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area;
2.
One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area;
3.
One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area.
g.
New manufactured home parks served by septic tank/drain field systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on Table MT-2 of the Department of Human Resources (DHR) Manual for on-site sewage management systems (DHR Table MT-2). These minimum lot sizes may be increased based on consideration of other factors as set out in sections A—F of the DHR manual.
1.
One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area;
2.
One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; and
3.
One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area.
h.
If the applicable zoning ordinance requires a larger lot size than that required by subsections f. and g., the larger lot size shall be used.
i.
Any lot of record on the date of the adoption of this ordinance shall be exempt from the lot size standards required by subsections f. and g.
j.
No construction may proceed on a building or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Human Resources Manual and the lot size standards required by subsections f. and g.
k.
Facilities which handle hazardous materials, of the types (listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in accordance with any applicable federal or state spill prevention requirements and any state or local fire prevention code requirements.
l.
The design of any new facility for the spray irrigation of wastewater sludge in any high pollution susceptibility area shall comply with DNR's Criteria For Slow Rate Land Treatment (current edition), as amended, and other technical publications, as well as site-specific information submitted by a registered professional engineer for each such project.

Notes to tables
Section A. The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (3 or 4-bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed for construction or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the Putnam County Board of Health will require larger lots to assure usable soil area.
Section B. The Putnam County Board of Health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features.
Section C. Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively.
Section D. The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors.
Section E. There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent county zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met.
Section F. The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine the square footage of the lot needed, X, use the following formula:
X = 5,000 gal/day / 1,200 gal/acre/day
= 4.17 acres
= 4.17 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre
= 181,500 ft 2 area of land needed.
Likewise, for a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine the square footage of the lot needed, Y, for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula:
Y = 5,000 gal/day / 600 gal/acre/day
= 8.33 acres
= 8.33 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre
= 363,000 ft 2 area of land needed.
[(b)]
Exemptions. Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of this article is exempt from the minimum lot size requirements contained in subsection (a)(2)f and g.
(Ord. of 1-21-03(1); Ord. of 3-7-2006(2))
Sec. 30-170. - Wetlands district.
(a)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources and in which development activities are significantly restrained because of flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation, water quality maintenance and pollution control, water pollution control, flood control, natural resource education, opportunity for scientific study, and recreation.
The following categories of freshwater wetlands and aquatic habitats have been defined, identified, and mapped by DNR:
(1)
Open water. Areas of open water, primarily reservoirs, ponds, lakes, rivers, and estuaries.
(2)
Non-forested emergent wetlands. Freshwater marshes dominated by a variety of grasses, sedges, rushes, and broad-leaved aquatics associated with streams, pond areas, and tidally influenced non-saline waters.
(3)
Scrub/shrub wetlands. Non-forested areas dominated by woody shrubs, seedlings, and saplings averaging less than 20 feet in height; these wetlands may integrate with forested wetlands, non-forested emergent wetlands, and open water.
(4)
Forested wetlands. Natural or planted forested areas having a dominant tree crown closure of hardwoods, pines, gums, cypress, or any combination of these types. These areas are usually in stream or river floodplains, isolated depressions, and drain-ways, and contain standing or flowing water for a portion of the year. Subcategories are:
a.
Hardwood floodplain forests;
b.
Coniferous floodplain forests;
c.
Mixed floodplain forests;
d.
Non-alluvial forested wetlands.
(5)
Altered wetlands. Areas with hydric soils that have been denuded of natural vegetation and put to other uses, such as pasture, row crops, etc., but that otherwise retain certain wetlands functions and values.
(b)
District delineation. The wetlands area districts in the city are shown on and identified as such on the Little River Watershed and Wetland Delineation Map. Said overlay map is a generalized wetlands map and shows the general location of wetlands according to the 1987 National Wetlands Inventory and should be consulted by persons considering development activities in or near wetlands. However, this map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and shall not serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended.
(c)
Permit coordination process. In order to assure that all applicable federal and state requirements in regard to wetlands are met, the local issuing authority of the city shall compare all requests for subdivision, rezoning, development, construction, demolition, or land disturbance to the generalized wetlands map. This review is simply a coordination process and is not an additional wetlands permitting process. No action by the city or its employees shall relieve a landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. This review shall result in one of two actions by the local issuing authority:
(1)
He shall issue a local permit pursuant to the zoning ordinance of the city or the city land disturbance ordinance without requiring a jurisdictional wetlands determination by the Corps of Engineers if either of the following two conditions exists:
a.
The request does not involve an activity which would cause alteration of wetlands; or
b.
The request involves a location, which is not near or within a protected wetland boundary as shown on the generalized wetlands map.
(2)
He shall not issue a local permit but shall defer issuing any local permit pending a jurisdictional wetlands determination by the Corps of Engineers and shall issue such a permit only after either a letter of permission or a Section 404 permit is issued by the Corps of Engineers whenever his review determines that the request appears to involve land which contains wetlands or is located near wetlands so as to have a potential to alter them.
(d)
Limitations on land use. In addition to the provisions of the zoning ordinance, limitations on land use within wetlands districts shall be as follows:
(1)
No landfills shall be allowed.
(2)
No receiving areas or transfer points for toxic waste, hazardous waste, or other potential contaminants shall be allowed.
(3)
No permit for construction or development within the wetlands districts shall issue without action by the chief local issuing authority, the planning and zoning commission and the governing authority of the city, which shall consider the following factors and issue written findings in regard thereto before issuing such a permit:
a.
Whether impacts to an area would adversely affect the public health safety, welfare, or the property of others.
b.
Whether the area is unique or significant in the conservation of flora and fauna including threatened, rare, or endangered species.
c.
Whether alteration or impacts to wetlands will adversely affect the function including the flow or quality of water, cause erosion or shoaling, or impact navigation.
d.
Whether impacts or modification by a project would adversely affect fishing or recreational use of wetlands.
e.
Whether an alteration or impact would be temporary in nature.
f.
Whether the project contains significant state historical and archaeological resources, defined as "Properties On or Eligible for the National Register of Historic Places".
g.
Whether alteration of wetlands would have measurable adverse impacts on adjacent sensitive natural areas.
h.
Where wetlands have been created for mitigation purposes under Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act, such wetlands shall be considered for protection.
(e)
Permitted uses. Unless otherwise prohibited by the zoning ordinance, the following uses shall be permitted by right within the wetlands district:
(1)
Forestry activities that comply with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and to include road construction best management practices which comply with Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
(2)
Passive outdoor recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing.
(3)
Natural water quality treatment or purification.
(4)
Normal agricultural activities including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock, subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.

Sec. 30-171. - Water supply watershed protection district.
In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate, safe drinking water is essential. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff is threatened by both residential and commercial development. Land-disturbing activities can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. Stormwater runoff, from impervious surfaces can introduce toxins, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and making the resulting sewage more dangerous to humans and wildlife. To control and alleviate these problems and to protect public water supplies, water supply watershed districts shall be created as prescribed herein.
(1)
District delineation. The water supply watershed districts in the City of Eatonton, Putnam County are shown on and identified as such on the Little River Watershed and Wetland Delineation Map. These districts are defined as that area surrounded by the ridgelines of the respective watersheds upstream of a reservoir or government-owned water system intake and are divided for regulatory purposes by the arc formed by a radius seven miles upstream of each respective public water supply intake.
(2)
Limitations on land use. In addition to the provisions of the zoning ordinance, limitations on land use within water supply watershed districts shall be as follows:
a.
No landfills shall be allowed.
b.
The corridors of all perennial streams in a large water supply watershed tributary to a water supply reservoir within a seven-mile radius of the reservoir boundary shall be protected by the following criteria:
1.
A buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 100 feet on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
2.
No impervious surface shall be constructed within a 150-foot setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
3.
Septic tanks and septic tank drain fields shall be prohibited in the setback area of subsection 2., above.
c.
A tributary to the water supply intake in a large water supply watershed shall have no specified minimum criteria for protection, except that new facilities, located within seven miles of a water supply intake or water supply reservoir and which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces having spill and leak collection systems as prescribed by DNR.
d.
The perennial stream corridors of a small water supply watershed within a seven-mile radius upstream of a governmental-owned public drinking water supply intake or water supply reservoir shall be protected by the following criteria:
1.
A buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 100 feet on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
2.
No impervious surface shall be constructed within a 150-foot setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
3.
Septic tanks and septic tank drain fields are prohibited within a 150-foot setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
e.
The perennial stream corridors within a small water supply watershed and outside a seven-mile radius upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake or water supply reservoir are protected by the following criteria:
1.
A buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 50 feet on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
2.
No impervious surface shall be constructed within a 75-foot setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
3.
Septic tanks and septic tank drain fields are prohibited within a 75-foot setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
f.
The following criteria apply at all locations in a small water supply watershed:
1.
New hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities shall be prohibited.
2.
The impervious surface area, including all public and private structures, utilities, or facilities, of the entire water supply watershed shall be limited to 25 percent of the total area.
3.
Facilities, which handle hazardous materials of the types and amounts determined by the department of natural resources, shall perform their operations on an impermeable surface having spill and leak collection systems as prescribed by the department of natural resources.
g.
The owner of any water supply reservoir shall develop a reservoir management plan for approval of the governing authority of Putnam County and the department of natural resources. Said reservoir management plan shall address the recreational use of the reservoir and the maintenance of a buffer around the reservoir. Prohibitions or restrictions on all or some of the following recreational uses shall be addressed in the reservoir management plan to protect the water quality of the reservoir for drinking purposes while optimizing its recreational benefits: swimming, fishing, boating, docks, and public access. Furthermore, said plan shall mandate that a buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 150 feet from the reservoir boundary. The allowable buffer vegetation and disturbance shall be specified in the reservoir management plan. Reservoir owners, upon consideration of ground slopes and soil types, may adopt buffers of differing sizes only upon approval of the governing authority of the city and the department of natural resources.
(3)
Partial exemptions. The following activities shall be exempt from the provisions of this section, provided that the conditions described herein have been met:
a.
Land uses existing prior to the adoption of this article.
b.
