(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 203-2. - General applicability.
For the purpose of complying with the regulations of this article, no part of a yard or the off-street parking or loading spaces that are required in connection with any building or use shall be included as part of the yard or off-street parking or loading spaces required for another building, except as specifically provided in this article.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 203-3. - Spaces required.
(a)
New construction. Any new building or site improvement shall comply with the parking requirements of this article.

Maintenance and repair. An existing building or site may be repaired, maintained or brought up to code standards without providing additional parking or loading space, provided there is no increase in gross floor area or site area.
(c)
Additions and expansion.
(1)
When an existing building, use or site is increased in gross floor area by up to 25 percent cumulatively, parking and/or loading is required for the additional floor or site area only.

(1)
Calculation of required spaces.
a.
When a lot is used for two or more uses, the parking requirements are the sum of the requirements for each use unless otherwise specified in this article.
b.
In determining the required number of spaces, fractional spaces are rounded up to the nearest whole number with one-half or more counted as one additional space.
c.
Unless otherwise identified, the parking requirement is based on the gross floor area (GFA) of a building devoted to the use(s) identified.
d.
When bench space is used for calculating parking spaces, 30 inches of seating width is equal to one seat.
(2)
Driveway visibility.
a.

(2)
Lease agreements must be for a term of not less than one year to serve the use or uses proposed to be satisfied by the off-site leased parking.
