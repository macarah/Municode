(a)
Variance requests from the requirements of this article shall be submitted on an application form as prescribed by the Community Development Department or the Director's designee, along with such fees as shall be established by the Mayor and City Council. The Director of the Community Development Department or the Director's designee shall coordinate the review of each variance request with all other affected city departments and shall forward such comments or recommendations as may be received to the Mayor and City Council for action in their normal course of business. The review must include a recommendation from the Public Works Department.
(b)
This section describes how to apply for a variance from this division; however, any activity within a state waters' buffer must meet state requirements.
(c)
Variances may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
If the project involves the construction of one single-family home for residential use by the owner of the subject property on a parcel that was platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the Public Works Department finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the Mayor and City Council may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. The Mayor and City Council are authorized to use a consent agenda to fulfill the terms of this subsection.
(2)
Except as provided above, the Mayor and City Council shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the Mayor and City Council. The Community Development Department shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least once a week for two consecutive weeks before it is heard. The Community Development Department shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing at least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
(3)
No application or reapplication for a variance affecting the same stream segment on a property shall be heard within 12 months from the date of last action by the Mayor and City Council unless such 12-month period is waived by the Mayor and City Council, and in no case may such application or reapplication be reconsidered in less than six months from the date of last action by the Mayor and City Council.
(4)
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
(5)
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
The applicant provides evidence that impacts to the buffer have been avoided or minimized to the fullest extent practicable; and
b.
The project involves the construction or repair of a structure that, by its nature, must be located within the buffer. Such structures include dams and detention/retention ponds;
c.
Paved recreational foot trails and viewing areas, providing that impacts to the buffer are minimal;
d.
The proposed land disturbing activity within the buffer will receive a permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendment of 1972, 33 USC 1344, and the Corps of Engineers has received a mitigation plan to be implemented as a condition of such a permit. In addition, land disturbing activities in the buffer that are outside the USACE's jurisdiction must be mitigated;
e.
The buffer intrusion is mitigated using the procedure established in the city stormwater design manual; or
f.
A valid and complete application for rezoning of the property is submitted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived and approval of the rezoning application by the Mayor and City Council occurs after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and the variance request is consistent with the intent of this article factoring into account the property owner's reliance on standards in effect at the time of the rezoning.

DIVISION 5. - TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES

Sec. 401-23. - Purpose and intent.
Understanding the demands placed on the community's transportation network by development is an important dimension of assessing the overall impacts of development. All development generates traffic, and it may generate enough traffic to create congestion and thus require the community to invest more capital funds into the transportation network in the form of new roads, traffic signals and intersection improvements. Traffic congestion results in a number of problems, including economic costs due to delayed travel times, air pollution and accidents. By requiring traffic impact studies for proposed developments meeting certain thresholds, the city will be better able to determine the transportation demands of development proposals and provide for reduction of adverse impacts on the transportation system.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 401-24. - Objectives.
The city finds that requiring a traffic impact study for proposed developments that meet certain thresholds will help to achieve the following objectives:
(1)
Forecast additional traffic associated with new development, based on accepted practices.
(2)
Determine the improvements that are necessary to accommodate the new development.
(3)
Allow the local government to assess the impacts that a proposed development may have and assist the local government in making decisions regarding development proposals.
(4)
Help to ensure safe and reasonable traffic conditions on streets after the development is complete.
(5)
Reduce the negative impacts created by developments by helping to ensure that the transportation network can accommodate the development.
(6)
Protect the substantial public investment in the street system.
(7)
Provide information relevant to comprehensive planning, transportation planning, transit planning and the provision of programs and facilities for traffic safety, road improvements, transportation demand management, pedestrian access and other transportation system considerations.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 401-25. - Reserved.
Sec. 401-26. - Thresholds of applicability.
A traffic impact study shall be required for any discretionary development proposal which meets or exceeds the thresholds in the following table.
EXPAND
Type of Development Threshold
Office Greater than 125,000 gross square feet
Commercial Greater than 100,000 gross square feet

  (Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 401-27. - Exemptions.
(a)
A traffic impact study is not required if a discretionary development proposal is initiated by the city.
(b)
A discretionary development proposal may be exempted from the traffic impact study requirement by the Community Development Department Director if a prior traffic impact study for the subject property has been submitted to the city and the proposed development is substantially similar to that for which the prior traffic impact study was conducted.
(c)
Any development of regional impact that complies with rules of the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA) shall be exempt from this article.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 401-28. - Determination of applicability.
At the time a discretionary development proposal is filed, or during any pre-application meeting if possible, Community Development Department staff shall determine whether a traffic impact study shall be required according to this article. Community Development Department staff shall calculate the expected trip generation of the proposed development using professionally accepted trip generation rates or other data and compare it to the thresholds specified in this article to determine whether a traffic impact study is required.
Applicants for discretionary development proposals shall provide sufficient information about the development proposal (e.g., number of dwelling units, square footage of buildings, number of employees, land area of the development, etc.) for Community Development Department staff to apply professionally accepted trip generation rates to the proposed development. Community Development Department staff shall not accept a discretionary development proposal for processing unless it contains the data on the proposed development necessary to apply available trip generation rates.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 401-29. - Scoping meeting.
Once it is determined that a traffic impact study is required, a scoping meeting may be held with the developer or his or her consultant and the appropriate representatives of the city. It will be the responsibility of the developer or his or her consultant to initiate this meeting. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the availability of site-specific information concerning the development, available forecasts of traffic volumes, and to ensure the applicant understands the content requirements for traffic impact studies.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 401-30. - Required contents of a traffic impact study.
(a)

(1)
Alternative transportation. Alternative transportation (sidewalk, bicycle, transit) impacted or needed as a result of the development.
(2)
References. A listing of all technical documents and resources cited or consulted in preparing the traffic impact study.
(3)
Technical appendix. Relevant technical information, including but not limited to: copies of raw traffic count data used in the analysis, calculation sheets and/or computer software output for all LOS and V/C calculations in the analysis, and warrant worksheets for signals, turn lanes, signal phasing, etc. used in the analysis.
(4)
Mitigation measures and costs. Listing of all intersections and road segments that are forecasted to be level of service "E" and "F" in the horizon year, or if phased, in the years that each phase is planned to be complete, and an identification and description of specific mitigation measures including signal, turn lane, or other warrant analyses as appropriate and necessary to bring these intersections and road segments into compliance with a level of service "D" or other city-adopted level of service for said road segment or intersection.
(b)
If roadway improvements are needed, the study shall show a drawing at an engineering scale of one inch equals 20 feet for all recommended lane configurations.
(c)
If signalization is warranted by the traffic signal warrants outlined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), a warrant analysis shall also be conducted as a part of the traffic impact study. If a traffic signal is warranted, the warrant package in the study shall show a drawing at an engineering scale of one inch equals 20 feet, detailing the signal design and phasing plans.
(d)
The estimated cost associated with implementing all such mitigation measures shall be provided in the traffic impact study. The traffic impact study may take into account any city/county/state-approved roadway, traffic signalization and other improvements in determining mitigation measures and providing recommendations.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 401-31. - Additional technical specifications.
Community Development Department staff is further authorized to promulgate and require the use of additional technical specifications for conducting traffic impact studies, which shall be consistent with analysis methods included in the most recent Highway Capacity Manual, Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, Trip Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), and/or Traffic Access and Impact Studies for Site Development: A Recommended Practice (Washington, DC: Institute of Transportation Engineers, 1991), as may be amended or republished from time to time.

(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 401-33. - Submittal and review of study.
The applicant for the proposed development or the qualified professional shall submit one electronic copy of the traffic impact study and technical appendix, two paper copies of the traffic impact study and one paper copy of the technical appendix to the Community Development Department. Community Development Department staff may submit copies of the report to applicable review agencies which may include the Georgia Department of Transportation, GRTA, an adjacent local jurisdiction and/or metropolitan planning organization or regional development center. Within ten working days of receipt of a traffic impact study, Community Development Department staff shall review all calculations and analyses and determine if they are complete, reasonable, understandable, consistent and fully explained. The conclusions presented in the traffic impact study shall be consistent with and supported by the data, calculations and analyses in the report. Calculations, graphs, tables, data and/or analysis results that are contrary to good common sense or not consistent with and supported by the data will not be accepted. In such events, Community Development Department staff shall return the traffic impact study to the development applicant for correction.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 401-34. - Recommendations for mitigation of impacts.
Within ten working days of receipt of a completed traffic impact study, Community Development Department staff shall complete his or her review of the study and submit to the applicant all recommendations for mitigation measures as stated in the traffic impact study and include any interpretations or recommended conditions of approving the discretionary development proposal that will mitigate traffic impacts of the proposed development.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 401-35. - Determination of project and system improvements.
Community Development Department staff shall determine which mitigation measures constitute "project" improvements and which mitigation measures constitute "system" improvements within the context of the Georgia Development Impact Fee Act of 1990.
In the event that a particular improvement is called for in the traffic impact study or recommended by Community Development Department staff, and Community Development Department staff is unable to uniquely attribute the recommendation as a project or system improvement or finds that such improvement has characteristics of both a project improvement and a system improvement, Community Development Department staff shall determine the proportion of the cost of such improvement that can reasonably be attributed to the development as a project improvement, and the portion of such improvement that can reasonably be considered a system improvement.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 401-36. - Conditions of development approval for project improvements.
Upon the determination of project improvements needed to mitigate the traffic impacts of the discretionary development proposal as provided in this article, Community Development Department staff shall recommend that the project improvements be completed by the developer as conditions of approval of the discretionary development proposal.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 401-37. - System improvements.
When Community Development Department staff recommends improvements as a condition of a discretionary development proposal that Community Development Department staff determines are wholly or partially "system" improvements, the Community Development Department may include such recommendations in the recommended conditions of approval for the discretionary development application. The development applicant and the city in the case of system improvements shall have the following options:
(1)
The applicant for a discretionary development proposal may voluntarily agree to pay for the cost of providing the system improvements, or a pro-rated share of the cost of said system improvements that are reasonably attributed to the subject development, as determined by the city.
(2)
In the case of an application for discretionary development proposal before the Mayor and City Council, the city may find that the proposed development will provide substantial adverse impacts on the transportation system. The city may find further that the existing transportation system is insufficient to serve the proposed development and the city is unable to provide adequate transportation facilities within a reasonable amount of time after the impacts of said development would occur. Given such findings, the Mayor and City Council may reduce the development density or intensity to the degree that the impacts of the development proposal do not degrade transportation facilities below adopted level of service standards, require a phasing of the development in a manner that adequate public facilities will be provided publicly or privately, or in cases where such other alternatives do not address the adverse impacts, deny an application for a discretionary development proposal.
