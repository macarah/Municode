ARTICLE V. - ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS
DIVISION 1. - CHATTAHOOCHEE RIVER TRIBUTARY PROTECTION

Sec. 405-1. - Statutory authorization.
This division is adopted pursuant to the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-453.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 405-2. - Findings.
The Mayor and Council of the city find that:
(1)
The Chattahoochee River provides multiple public benefits, which includes use of the river as the primary water supply for metropolitan Atlanta.
(2)
The water quality of the Chattahoochee River depends upon the water quality of the flowing streams tributary to the river.
(3)
Sediment and other polluting materials and conditions including, but not limited to, pesticides, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, toxic materials, and elevations in water temperature are harmful to the water quality of the river and its tributaries.
(4)
The riparian vegetation along these watercourses helps preserve water quality. Dense tree growth helps to prevent stream bank erosion, and streamside vegetation reduces the amount of sediment and other polluting materials that would otherwise wash into streams. Riparian trees, by shading, help maintain cooler water temperatures and thus enhance water quality.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 405-3. - Purposes.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to minimize public and private losses due to erosion, siltation, and water pollution; and to maintain stream water quality in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Create vegetative buffer areas adjacent to tributary streams in the drainage area of the Chattahoochee Corridor.
(2)
Minimize land disturbing activities within such buffer areas by requiring issuance of a permit for such activities.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)

DIVISION 2. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION

Sec. 405-18. - Title, findings, and objectives.
(a)
Title and findings of fact.
(1)
This article shall be known as the "Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of Norcross, Georgia." In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate with the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas.
(2)
Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(3)
According to available data provided by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the city contains significant groundwater recharge areas. Additionally, according to the Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia, the city is within an area having a low susceptibility rating (drastic rating less than 141).
(b)
Objectives. The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(2)
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
(3)
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)

DIVISION 4. - CHATTAHOOCHEE RIVER WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED PROTECTION

Sec. 405-30. - Title, findings and purpose.
(a)
Title of article. This article shall be known as the "Chattahoochee River Water Supply Watershed Protection Ordinance."
(b)
Findings of fact.
(1)
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
(2)
The city has determined that land inside the city lies within the Chattahoochee River Water Supply Watershed. This watershed is greater than 100 square miles in size and is categorized as a large water supply watershed under the provisions of this article. As of the date of adoption of this article, no portion of the city lies within seven miles upstream of a water supply reservoir but a portion of the city lies within seven miles upstream of an active water supply intake.
(3)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to the portions of the Chattahoochee River Watershed, which occur within the jurisdiction of the city and are herein identified as water supply watershed.
