ARTICLE VI. - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS

Sec. 206-1. - Purpose.
(a)
Within the districts established by this UDO or amendments thereto that may later be adopted there exist lots, structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this UDO was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited under the terms of this UDO or any future amendment.
(b)
It is the intent of this UDO to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this UDO that nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded nor extended, nor be used as a basis for additional structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
(c)
Variances of area, width, and yard requirements may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals where necessary and where such addition does not create an unusual neighborhood building type.
(d)
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this UDO shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this UDO and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner, and demolition, elimination and removal of an existing structure in connection with such construction, provided that actual construction work shall be diligently carried on until the completion of the building involved.

This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, if yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the provisions of this article.
