Sec. 404-2. - Findings.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(2)
Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas.
(3)
Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can:
a.
Protect human life and health;
b.
Minimize damage to private property;
c.
Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as ware and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and
d.
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
(4)
Article IX, section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia (Ga. Const. art. IX, § II), O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a), have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. There, the city does ordain this chapter and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 404-3. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, stream bank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(5)
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and,
(6)
Protect the stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

(1)
Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot;
(2)
Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity;
(3)
Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or
(4)
Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation.
(b)
Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under subsection (a) of this section shall also meet the following conditions:
(1)
Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel;
(2)
Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than two percent;

Sec. 404-17. - Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments.
An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed developments activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of section 107-95 apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the state and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the Community Development Department prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include:
(1)
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
(2)
Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the Community Development Department. Cross sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles;
(3)
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development;

(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 404-18. - Floodway encroachments.
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways much remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) of this section;
(2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and
(3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the Community Development Department until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the Community Development Department.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 404-19. - Maintenance requirements.
The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The Community Development Department may direct the property owner (at no cost to the city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the Community Development Department.

Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate the structure, openings sufficient to equalize the hydrologic flood forces on exterior walls and to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 404-20(5).
(b)
Nonresidential buildings. For new construction or substantial improvement of any principal nonresidential building, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement and access to the building, shall be at least one foot above the level of the base flood elevation or at least as high as the future-conditions flood elevation, whichever is higher. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate the structure, openings sufficient to equalize the hydrologic flood forces on exterior walls and to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 404-20(5).
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019; Ord. No. 03-2020 , § I, 4-6-2020)
Sec. 404-23. - Building standards for residential single-lot developments on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones).
(a)
For a residential single-lot development not part of a subdivision that has areas of special flood hazard, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones) the Community Development Director shall review and reasonably utilize any available scientific or historic flood elevation data, base flood elevation and floodway data, or future-conditions flood elevation data available from a federal, state, local or other source, in order to administer the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(b)
If data are not available from any of these sources, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to twice the width of the stream or 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream, whichever is greater.
(2)
In special flood hazard areas without base flood or future-conditions flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with section 404-20(5).
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 404-24. - Building standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones).
Areas of special flood hazard may include designed "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. In these areas the following provisions apply:
(1)
New and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to no lower than one foot above the flood depth number in feet specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 404-20(5).
(2)
New and substantial improvements of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot above the highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice; and
(3)
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 404-25. - Standards for subdivisions.
Standards for subdivisions shall be as follows:
(1)
All subdivision proposals shall identify the special flood hazard area and provide base flood elevation data and future-conditions flood elevation data;
(2)
All residential lots in a subdivision proposal shall have sufficient buildable area outside of the future-conditions floodplain such that encroachments into the future-conditions floodplain for residential structures will not be required;
(3)
All subdivision plans will provide the elevations of proposed structures in accordance with section 404-10;
(4)
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and shall be reasonably safe from flooding;
(5)
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters, and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; and,
(6)
All subdivision proposals shall include adequate drainage and stormwater management facilities per the requirements of the city to reduce potential exposure to flood hazards.

DIVISION 5. - VARIANCES

Sec. 404-26. - Procedures.
The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the Community Development Department or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated hereinabove.
(1)
Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the Community Development Department. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the Community Development Department. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(2)
Any person adversely affected by any decision of the Community Development Department shall have the right to appeal such a decision to the Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the city in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the Zoning Board of Appeals. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(3)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(4)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(5)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(6)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(7)
In reviewing such requests, the Community Development Department and the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this section and other sections of this chapter.
(8)
Conditions for variances:
a.
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
1.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
2.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
3.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
b.
The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
c.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
d.
The Community Development Director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(9)
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the Community Development Authority and the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary to the consideration of the request.
(10)
Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this chapter, the Community Development Department and the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
(11)
Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."
