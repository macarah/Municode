(2)
The official zoning map shall be a hard copy map (paper, mylar, vellum or other similar material) identified by a signature block that includes the signature of the Mayor, and attested by the City Clerk, over the following words: "This is to certify that this is the official zoning map referred to in the Norcross Zoning Ordinance" together with the date of its adoption.
(3)
The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this zoning ordinance are depicted on and maintained as part of the city's geographic information system (GIS), under the direction of the City Manager.

(c)
Replacement of official zoning map. In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the Mayor and City Council may by ordinance adopt a new official zoning map which shall supersede the prior official zoning map, and shall be identified by the signature block described in subsection 201-3(a)(2).

(e)
Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the location of the boundaries of any zoning district in the city, the following rules shall apply:
(1)
Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as approximately following a corporate limits line, a militia district line, a land lot line, a lot line or the centerline of a street, a county road, a state highway, an interstate highway or a railroad right-of-way or such lines extended, then such lines shall be constructed to be the zoning district boundary lines.
(2)
Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as being set back from a street, a county road, a state highway, an interstate highway or a railroad right-of-way, and approximately parallel thereto, then such zoning district boundary line shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the centerline of street, county road, state highway, interstate highway or railroad right-of-way and as being parallel thereto.
(3)
Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot, the location of the line shall be the scaled distance from the lot lines. In this situation, the requirements of the zoning district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall apply to the balance of the lot except that such extension shall not include any part of a lot that lies more than 50 feet beyond the zoning district boundary line.
(4)
In the case of a through lot fronting on two approximately parallel streets, that is divided by a zoning district boundary line paralleling the streets, the restrictions of the zoning district in which each frontage of the through lot lies shall apply to that portion of the through lot.

Sec. 201-18. - C2 general business.
modified
(a)
Purpose. The C2 general business district is established to provide adequate space in appropriate locations along major streets, thoroughfares and at intersections for various types of business and service uses. These uses should include the retailing of major goods and services, general office facilities, and public functions that would serve a community area of several neighborhoods. Development of uses in the district characteristically occupies a larger area than in the C1 neighborhood business district because it is intended to serve a greater population and to offer a wider range of goods and services. Orientation and expansion of this district should occur as an increase in depth at major intersections rather than as a strip-like extension along the street or thoroughfare.

The Buford Highway district is intended to encourage the redevelopment of Buford Highway in conformance with the vision for the corridor in the city's comprehensive plan and the Buford Highway Master Plan as a mixed-use and multimodal corridor. The district utilizes design standards and land use controls that will provide the necessary transition from the industrial and commercial character into the historic areas of the city, while maintaining opportunity for growth and economic vibrancy. To this end, in order to promote the vision of the city, any multifamily project within the district shall present, for administrative approval by the Mayor and Council at a regularly scheduled meeting, a plan for the mix of uses proposed for any site before moving beyond preliminary design review and approval of staff and the Architectural Review Board.

(1)
Purpose. The purposes of the site analysis plan are to:
a.
Delineate areas that have been identified as worthy of permanent protection in conservation space because of their environmental values. This delineation shall include, but shall not be limited to, the information and steps listed in this section.
b.
Set forth the particulars of the site, including boundary, topographic data (minimum four-foot contour intervals), existing structures and utility easements.
c.
Together with the environmental site assessment (phase one) report, provide the starting point for design of the conservation subdivision with built areas being designed as separate from the areas delineated as worthy of permanent protection.
(2)
Existing features. The existing features site analysis plan shall include at least the following information:
a.
Perennial and intermittent streams, FEMA designated 100-year flood hazard zones and wetlands. The source of this information shall also be indicated.
b.
Identification of tree lines, native woodlands, open fields or meadows, peaks or rock outcroppings, and prime agricultural land.

Lot width average, area and percent of floodplain specifications in tabular form; and density calculations (gross and net).
(3)
Density. Subdivisions in the overlay district may build to a maximum net density in excess of that normally allowed in the underlying district in exchange for the dedication of conservation space, as follows:

a.
Delineation. Priority shall be given in delineating conservation space areas as those areas of significance identified in the existing features site analysis plan, around which the built areas are designed.
b.
Undeveloped and natural. Conservation space shall remain undeveloped and natural except for the provision of non-motorized passive recreation opportunities such as running, walking, biking, and similar outdoor activities. Wetland and stream bank mitigation projects also are permitted. Primary conservation areas are required to be included in the conservation space. These areas shall be covered by a provision for permanent protection and shall include 100-year floodplains, stream buffer zones, slopes greater than 40 percent consisting of a contiguous area of at least 5,000 square feet, wetlands, endangered or threatened species or their habitat, archeological sites, cemeteries or burial grounds. Secondary conservation areas are features and areas recommended and desirable for conservation space designation and may be covered by the provisions for permanent protection. These include important historic sites, existing healthy, native forests of at least one contiguous acre, scenic view sheds, peaks and rock outcroppings, prime agriculture lands, and existing trails that connect the tract to neighboring areas.
