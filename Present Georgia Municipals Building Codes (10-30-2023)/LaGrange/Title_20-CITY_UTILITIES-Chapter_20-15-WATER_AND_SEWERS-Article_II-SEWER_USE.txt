  Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and shall pay the costs to provide additional measures if required by city. City reserves the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease discharge, or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the formula.
(e)
Grease interceptor maintenance.
(1)
Pumping. All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is strictly prohibited.
(2)
Pumping frequency. Outdoor grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three (3) months. Under-sink or in-line grease interceptors must be pumped/cleaned out completely a minimum of once every month. Grease interceptors may need to be pumped more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer collection system. In the discretion of the city, pumping frequency may be extended past the minimum period if user can demonstrate that such schedule meets with the intent of this section.
(3)
Pump out order. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed city maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds thirty-three (33) percent of the total depth of the trap, city will issue a pump out order to the user. The user shall have seven (7) days from receipt of the order to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written or verbal warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have twenty-four (24) hours to comply.
(4)
Disposal of interceptor pumped material. All waste removed from each grease interceptor shall be recorded on a proper manifest form. Also, all waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed at a facility approved by city to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program.
