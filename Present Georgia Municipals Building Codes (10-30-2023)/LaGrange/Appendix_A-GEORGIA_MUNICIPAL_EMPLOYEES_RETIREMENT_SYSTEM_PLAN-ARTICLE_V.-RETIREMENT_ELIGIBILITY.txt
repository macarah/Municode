ARTICLE V. - RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY
(a)
The Retirement prerequisites of a Participant under this Plan are contingent upon the type of Retirement offered by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement and selected by the Participant: that is, Normal Retirement, Alternative Normal Retirement, Early Retirement, Late Retirement, or Disability Retirement, as applicable. The provision of an Alternative Normal Retirement benefit or the designation of an Alternative Normal Retirement Date in the Adoption Agreement shall not be construed to establish an Alternative Normal Retirement Age or Alternative Normal Retirement Date for purposes of the definition of Accrued Benefit under Section 2.01, for purposes of computing death benefits under Article VIII, or for purposes of applying the actuarial equivalent conversion provisions of Article XII. The minimum age and service requirements and other prerequisites associated with each type of Retirement for each class of Eligible Employees shall be as specified in the pertinent sections of the Adoption Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in the Adoption Agreement with respect to in-service distributions for those who remain in service after their Normal Retirement Date, receipt of Retirement benefits shall also be contingent upon Termination of Employment.
(b)
Provided a Participant is otherwise eligible to receive a Retirement benefit under the Plan, Retirement is contingent upon the satisfactory completion of the Applicable Form provided for such purpose and the acceptance of the Applicable Form by the Pension Committee.
(c)
Retirement applications shall be prepared and submitted at such time as to reach the office of GMEBS no earlier than ninety (90) days and no later than thirty (30) days prior to a Participant's effective Retirement Date. A Participant's effective Retirement date shall be the first day of the month coinciding with or following the date he has satisfied all of the prerequisites for Retirement as specified in this Article V, and actually Retires.
