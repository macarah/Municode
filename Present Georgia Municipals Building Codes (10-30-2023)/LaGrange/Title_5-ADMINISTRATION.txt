(c)
Also within seven (7) calendar days of the filing of the complaint, the assistant city manager shall forward a copy of the complaint to the ethics hearing officer who shall review it to determine whether the complaint is unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or fails to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of this article. The hearing officer is empowered to dismiss in writing complaints that are determined to be unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or fail to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the city council; provided, however, that a rejection of such complaint by the hearing officer shall not deprive the complaining party of any action such party might otherwise have at law or in equity against the city official.
(d)
The hearing officer is empowered to conduct investigations, to take evidence, and to hold hearings to address the subject matter of a complaint.

Moreover, complaints shall only be accepted for actions alleged to have occurred subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, June 1, 2014. Resignation of a city official subsequent to the initiation of a complaint hereunder, but prior to action by the mayor and council pursuant to section 5-5-25(g), shall divest the council and the hearing officer of jurisdiction of the complaint and thereby terminate such proceedings.
(b)
