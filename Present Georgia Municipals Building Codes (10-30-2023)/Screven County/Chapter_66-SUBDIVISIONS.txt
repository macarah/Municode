ARTICLE IV. - PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL

Sec. 66-110. - Generally.
This article shall govern the procedures for filing and processing sketch plats, preliminary plats, final plats, and major and minor development plans. No sketch plat, preliminary plat, final plat, major development, or minor development shall be approved by the county unless in compliance with this article.
(Ord. of 11-9-2004(1), § 5)
Sec. 66-111. - Processes.
(a)
Major subdivision. The procedure for review, consideration, and approval of a major subdivision consists of four separate, required steps. These are:
(1)
Sketch plat;
(2)
Preliminary plat approved by the planning commission and board of commissioners;
(3)
Administrative approval of development plans by the zoning administrator; and
(4)
Final plat approval by the planning commission.
No preliminary plat shall be submitted for review by the planning commission until a sketch plat has been submitted to the planning commission. No final plat shall be submitted for review by the planning commission until a preliminary plat has been submitted to and approved by the planning commission and improvement plans have been approved by the zoning administrator and improvements are installed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. A final plat of the major subdivision shall be submitted for review and approved by the planning commission prior to the sale of any lots in the major subdivision.
(b)
Major development. The procedure for review, consideration, and approval of a major development plan, those not involving the subdivision of land, consists of three separate, required steps. These are:
(1)
Sketch plan;
(2)
Development plan approved by the planning commission and board of commissioners; and
(3)
Administrative approval of development plans by the zoning administrator.
No development plan shall be submitted for review by the planning commission until a sketch plan has been submitted to the planning commission. The zoning administrator shall not authorize development to commence until a development plan has been submitted to and approved by the planning commission and board of commissioners, and improvement plans have been approved by the zoning administrator.
(c)
Minor subdivision. Minor subdivisions shall not require planning commission review or approval, nor shall they require the submittal of a sketch plat or preliminary plat. The process for gaining approval of a minor subdivision shall be administrative, by filing with the zoning administrator for approval an application for final plat and demonstrating compliance with the application and improvement requirements of this chapter and the county zoning ordinance.
(d)
Limitations on minor subdivisions. The board of commissioners finds that minor subdivisions provide certain advantages, such as a shorter application process, fewer or no improvement requirements, and less public scrutiny, that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications. Given these advantages, the prospect exists that subdividers or successors in interest may seek to further divide a lot previously approved as part of a minor subdivision. Accordingly, no lot which is created as part of a minor subdivision after the effective date of this chapter amendment (Nov. 9. 2004) shall hereafter be further divided except pursuant to the requirements for major subdivisions as established in this chapter. Additionally, no lot which was platted as part of a minor subdivision approved after June 10, 1997, but prior to the effective date of this ordinance amendment, shall be further divided as a minor subdivision if the number of lots within the boundaries of the minor subdivision exceeds five. This shall not preclude a lot owner from subdividing pursuant to the major subdivision requirements of this chapter and the installation of all requirements for major subdivisions specified by this chapter.
When a subdivision plat that would otherwise be considered a minor subdivision is required pursuant to the provisions of this section to be filed as a major subdivision, the planning commission may recommend and the board of commissioners may approve waivers, on a case-by-case basis after application there for and for good cause shown, to all or portions of the requirements of section 66-181 of this chapter. The purpose of this provision is to provide potential for relief to subdividers, as may be determined appropriate by the board of commissioners, who would without relief be required to install improvements for lots no longer owned by the subdivider.
(e)
Minor development. Minor developments, as determined by the zoning administrator, shall not require planning commission review or approval, nor shall they require the submittal of a sketch plan or preliminary plan. The process for gaining approval of a minor development shall be administrative, by filing with the zoning administrator for approval an application for minor development plan approval and demonstrating compliance with the application and improvement requirements of this ordinance and the county zoning ordinance.
(Ord. No. 97-08, § 4.1, 6-10-1997; Ord. of 11-9-2004(1), § 6; Ord. of 7-12-05, § 2; Ord. of 4-13-2021(1), § 2)
Sec. 66-112. - Review procedure.
The following procedure shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats or development plans:
(1)
Sketch plan procedures. Prior to the review, consideration, and approval of a preliminary plat by the planning commission, the subdivider or developer must submit to the building and zoning official a simple sketch plan of the proposed development. If phase development is contemplated, then a sketch for each phase will be required. Included with the sketch plan must be a sketch map which shows the subdivision or development in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider or developer prior to extensive site planning necessary for the preparation of the preliminary plat and enable the subdivider or developer to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided or developed. Utilizing the comprehensive plan and this chapter, the building and zoning official shall review the sketch plan submittal for compliance with this chapter. If the sketch plan meets the requirements of this ordinance, the building and zoning official shall schedule it for presentation to the planning commission at its next regularly scheduled meeting. If discrepancies are found in the sketch plan, the building and zoning official shall note all such discrepancies on the sketch plan and return it to the subdivider or developer for correction before presenting the same to the planning commission. Approval of the sketch plan does not authorize the developer to begin the proposed construction or improvements.
(2)
Preliminary plat procedures.
a.
Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat or development plan shall be submitted to the planning commission. The plat of the subdivision or development plan shall be submitted in four blue line prints and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained in this chapter. Preliminary plats submitted to the planning commission shall contain the name, phone number, and address of the subdivider or developer (or subdivider's or developer's designee); and may not be approved until all requirements for preliminary plats are met.
b.
Additional copies of the plat or plan and supplemental information may be requested by the planning commission. The copies mentioned in this subsection shall be distributed as required by section 66-152 and other person or agency as deemed necessary by the planning commission. The person or agency to which a copy of the plat or plan is directed shall indicate desired changes or comments of the plat or plan and shall promptly return the plat to the planning commission.
c.
Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat or development plan shall be submitted to the planning commission at least 30 days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting date of the commission. The planning commission shall act on the preliminary plat request within two regularly scheduled meetings after formal submission by making its recommendations concerning the plat in writing to the board of commissioners. Preliminary plats must be approved by the board of commissioners prior to proceeding with subdivision or development.
d.
The date on which the board of commissioners granted approval of the preliminary plat shall be noted on the plat. Failure of a subdivider or developer to submit for final plat approval (where applicable) and initiate development within 18 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require resubmittal of a preliminary plan to the planning commission.
e.
Application for approval of the final record plat will be considered only after the requirements for the preliminary plat or development plan approval as specified in this article have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider or developer may proceed to comply with the other requirements of this chapter and the preparation of the final subdivision plat or development plan. If the subdivider or developer fails to act within 12 months of approval of the preliminary plat, such approval shall become void unless an extension is requested by the subdivider or developer and approved by the planning commission.
(3)
Final plat procedure.
a.
Application. Application for final plat approval of the subdivision plat or development plan, whether major or minor, shall be submitted to the zoning administrator.

Permanent reference points. Prior to the approval of the final plat, all the subdivision's or development's permanent reference points shall have been placed in accordance with the following requirements:
(1)
Subdivision or development corner tie. At least one corner of the subdivision or development shall be designated by course and distance (tie) from a readily discernable reference marker. If a corner is within 2,000 feet of a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Station, U.S. Geological Survey, or state grid system coordinated monument, then this corner shall be marked with a monument so designated by computed X and Y coordinates which shall appear on the map with a statement identifying this station or monument to an accuracy of 1:10,000. When such a monument or station is not available, the tie shall be made to some permanent and readily recognizable landmark or identifiable point, physical object or structure. In subdivisions of more than ten lots, the information for this corner tie shall include elevation above sea level making it in effect a benchmark which can be used to determine if individual lots are in a flood-prone area.
(2)
Monuments.
a.
Monuments shall be located in the ground at all angles in the boundaries of the subdivision or development; at the intersection lines of streets and at the intersection of the lines of streets with boundaries of the plat and at the intersection of alleys with the boundaries of the subdivision or development; at all points of curvature, points in the side lines of streets and alleys; and at all angles of an intermediate traverse line.
b.
It is not intended or required that monuments be placed within the traveled portion of a street to mark angles in the boundary of the subdivision or development if the angle points can be readily reestablished by reference to monuments along the side lines of the streets.
c.
All required monuments shall be placed flush with the ground, where practicable.
d.
If the required location of a monument is in an inaccessible place, or where the location of a monument would be clearly impractical, it is sufficient to place a reference monument nearby and the precise location thereof shall be clearly indicated on the plat and referenced to the true point.
e.
All monuments used shall be made of a minimum of solid iron or steel bars at least one-half inch in diameter and 24 inches long.
f.
If a point required to be marked by a monument is on a bedrock outcropping, a steel rod, at least one-half inch in diameter shall be drilled and grouted into solid rock to a depth of at least eight inches.
(3)
Control corners. Within each block of a subdivision at least two monuments designed and designated as control corners shall be installed. All control corners shall be constructed of concrete and shall be at least four inches in diameter or square and not less than three feet in length. Each monument shall have imbedded in its top or attached by a suitable means, a metal plate of noncorrosive materials and marked plainly with the point, the surveyor's registration number, the month and year it was installed and the words "control corner."
(4)
Property markers. A steel or wrought iron pipe or the equivalent not less than one-half inch in diameter and at least 24 inches in length shall set all corners, except those located by monuments.
(5)
Accuracy. Land surveys, both within the limits of incorporated areas and beyond shall be at an accuracy of at least 1:7,500.

ARTICLE VI. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS

Sec. 66-181. - Number of lots versus improvement standards.
By permitting varying numbers of lots and varying levels of improvements, regulations enable the small developer to provide for growth in the rural, more slowly developing area of the county characterized by a lower lot absorption rate. Less restrictive development standards are imposed according to quantity of lots to allow for flexibility in subdivision sizes.
EXPAND
Subdivision Type Required Improvements
Intra-family land transfer None. Ingress and egress easements of not less than 30 feet to county road. Limited to one time per eligible family member for each tract of land to be subdivided.
Minor subdivision—5 or fewer lots None. Ingress and egress easements of not less than 30 feet to a county road are required.
Major subdivision of 10 or fewer lots Site grading for adequate drainage; street signs; subdivision entrance regulation consistent with the requirements of section 66-182(11); and paved access to an existing paved street, road or highway, provided, however, that paved access shall not be required if all lots in the proposed subdivision are located on the right-of-way of an existing county road.
Major subdivision of 11 or more lots Paved access to an existing paved street, road or highway; community water supply and system; sewage system if soil is unable to support the required number of on-site sewage disposal units; storm drainage system; site grading for adequate drainage; and street signs
  (Ord. No. 97-08, § 6.1, 6-10-1997; Ord. of 11-9-2004(1), § 13; Ord. of 7-12-05, §§ 6—8)
Sec. 66-182. - Additional required improvements for major subdivisions of 11 or more lots.
A well-designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by this chapter necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat.
(1)
Natural gas. When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way, where possible such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties.
(2)
Water supply. Water systems installed in subdivisions of more than 20 lots shall provide fire flow capability. The system shall be designed and installed to meet or exceed the minimum standards adopted by the state for water systems, including those which may be utilized for fire protection. Water mains shall provide a minimum flow of 500 gallons per minute for two hours, plus potable water demand at the furthermost point from the tank. Fire hydrants shall be located so as to best serve the proposed residences of the subdivision and as shall be approved by the county's fire service coordinator or the planning commission. Fire hydrants shall be installed so that the distance from the landscaped finished grade to the lower threads of the barrel opening shall be no less than 24 inches. All fire hydrants shall open counterclockwise and shall be painted per NFPA color coding for through flow.
(3)
Sanitary sewer. If a sanitary sewer is installed in a subdivision, sanitary sewers shall be installed to the plans and specifications approved by and in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county health department. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street.
(4)
Sewage disposal system. Prior to the construction of any community sewage disposal system such as private septic tanks, an oxidation pond or other facility, the location, size, plans and specifications of such a facility shall be approved by and be in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the board of commissioners, and the county health department.
(5)
Curb and gutters. If concrete curbs or paved valley type gutters are required, they shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by an engineer, registered surveyor or architect and approved by the building and zoning official, or the local governing authority or its designee.
(6)
Street grading and surfacing. Street grading, base preparation, and surfacing shall be carried out by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the county or the state department of transportation.
(7)
Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system designed to accommodate a 25-year, 24-hour rain event, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the building and zoning official.
(8)
Street name signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections within a subdivision. The location and design shall be approved by the board of commissioners or its designee.
(9)
Topsoil. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover on the lots and at least four inches of cover between sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting. The excavation and treatment of overburden during construction shall be inspected by the Natural Resource Conservation Service.
(10)
Paving. Paving shall be as required in section 66-181 hereinabove. It is the intent of this provision that where paved access is required, all lots in the subdivision shall have paved access to an existing paved road or paved highway. Further, where paving is required, the planning commission shall approve the design of the proposed streets or roads at the sketch plan stage.
(11)
Subdivision entrances. At the sketch plan, the planning commission may limit the number of entrances, driveways, or curb cuts. At the preliminary and final plat stages, the building and zoning official shall coordinate with the county manager, county engineer, and public safety director with respect to entrances, driveways, or curb cuts. Design standards on county or state roads shall be consistent with all state, federal, and local laws and applicable chapters, including the state department of transportation rules and all amendments or revisions in effect as of the date of the preliminary plat approval. At the sketch plan stage, the planning commission may consider safety as well as require available alternatives for reducing the number of entrances, driveways or curb cuts.

Sec. 66-185. - Dedications.
(a)
Acceptance of public streets. It is the policy of the county that all subdivision streets and roads shall be dedicated and deeded to the county following proper construction unless the developer specifically requests that a street be accepted as a private street and the board of commissioners approves such request. Approval of a private street shall be the exception and the board of commissioners may require conditions to such approval as in its discretion it deems necessary for the public good and the protection and safety of the citizens of the county. (See section 66-186.) Following construction of the street or road, the board of commissioners shall consider a properly prepared deed tendered by the developer and upon formal acceptance of the deed by the commissioners, the street or road shall become part of the county road system. Construction of streets and roads, and paving where required, shall be completed prior to final plat approval and paid for by the developer.
(b)
Construction standards. All streets shall be constructed to standards adopted by the county. The design of the street shall be approved by the planning commission and construction shall be monitored by representatives of the county. Driveways, storm drainage, culverts, utility cuts and the like shall be installed during construction of the street or road and prior to paving.
(c)
Warranty of public streets and roads. The subdivider or developer shall provide a postconstruction warranty of each street or road accepted by the county as part of the county road system as to workmanship and materials for a period of one year. The subdivider or developer shall provide a bond or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of and acceptable to the county in the amount of one-half of the cost of construction of the street or road the terms of which shall provide that of the county road superintendent, or such other person as may be designated by the board of commissioners, shall determine during the warranty period that a deficiency in the road requires correction, and the subdivider or developer shall fail to make such correction in a timely manner as determined by the county in its sole discretion, then the entity providing the bond or letter shall, upon written application by the county, pay such sum as shall be demanded, up to the total amount of the bond or letter, for the purpose of making the repair or correcting the deficiency.
(d)
Street or road signs and traffic control devices. The subdivider or developer shall pay for and install all required street name signs and traffic control signs or devices.
(e)
Homeowners associations. The county shall not be a member of a homeowners' association by virtue of its ownership of the streets and roads in a subdivision or otherwise.

Sec. 66-186. - Private streets.
(a)
In certain circumstances, the board of commissioners may approve the construction of a private street within a subdivision or development. A private street is a street that is not accepted by the county as part of the county road system and is privately owned and maintained. Such streets or roads shall be constructed to the same standards and shall meet all other requirements with regard to road construction as is provided in this chapter for public streets or roads, including, but not limited to, the requirement for a minimum right-of-way of 60 feet. In addition, the developer shall:
(1)
Provide the county with a written release of maintenance agreement, acceptable to the county Board of Commissioners, releasing the county from responsibility for present or future maintenance and upkeep of the roadway;
(2)
Erect a sign indicating the existence of a private street at the intersection of each public street with a private street;
(3)
Include a disclosure statement on all sales agreements, deeds and plats relating to the subdivision or its lots indicating that the street or road is a private street, that the county has no responsibility for its maintenance or upkeep, the nature of the ownership of the street and responsibility for its maintenance and upkeep, and the rights of purchasers of lots in the subdivision to enforce such provisions.
(b)
Such streets shall be platted and deeded to a responsible association or entity, such as a homeowners association, approved by the board of commissioners. The board of commissioners may require, as a condition to approval of a private street or road:
(1)
That the developer provide a specific maintenance plan or financial guarantee of proper maintenance and repair;
(2)
Access easements in favor of the county and its various departments and agencies; or
(3)
Such other concessions as are deemed appropriate for the public good and the benefit of the lot owners.

Sec. 66-187. - Ownership and responsibility for common areas.
All common areas within the subdivision, including, but not limited to, private streets or roads, retention or detention ponds, playgrounds, clubhouses, pools and the like, shall be conveyed to a responsible association or entity, such as a homeowners' association, approved by the board of commissioners, which has the responsibility for maintenance and upkeep of the common area. The county shall have no liability with regard to or responsibility for the maintenance or repair of such common areas.
(Ord. No. 97-08, § 6.7, 6-10-1997)
Sec. 66-188. - Access.
Neither the planning commission nor the board of commissioners shall approve a subdivision or major development in a location where the existing roads providing primary access are inadequate to serve the additional traffic generated by the development. Where existing roads are inadequate to serve the additional traffic, the planning commission and board of commissioners shall require paved access to the subdivision or major development from an existing paved county road or state or federal highway. All construction cost and right-of-way acquisition to construct the road to DOT standards with a minimum 60-foot right-of-way shall be the responsibility of and be paid for by the developer. The BOC shall approve the DOT standard used and give final approval after construction is completed. If the ditches on existing county roads are to be used for drainage from the subdivision, major development, or road improvement, the developer shall regrade such ditches and provide an all-weather drainage outlet. All regarding and drainage outlets shall be approved by the board of commissioners or its authorized representatives.

ARTICLE VII. - DESIGN STANDARDS

Sec. 66-221. - Generally.
The standards contained in this article shall apply to the subdivision of land, major developments, the platting of lots, the development of all new public and private streets, and the establishment of all easements. These standards are in addition to the minimum requirements established in the county zoning ordinance for the zoning district in which the development or subdivision is located.
(Ord. No. 97-08, § 7.0, 6-10-1997; Ord. of 11-9-2004(1), § 16)
Sec. 66-222. - Streets.
Streets shall conform to current county road construction and maintenance specifications. that is, paving to Georgia DOT standards for paving or maintenance of county roads, provided, however, that the board of commissioners may establish reduced standards for construction of collector streets or roads and, specifically, paved access from a subdivision or development to an existing paved county, state or federal road, as set out in section 66-181, where, in the sole opinion of the board, traffic volumes, the location of the subdivision or development, or other such considerations, permit a deviation from DOT standards for construction of a county paved road. In such cases, the board may establish such requirements as it deems necessary and appropriate to protect the citizens of the county.
(1)
Conformity to existing maps or plans. The location and width of all proposed streets shall be in conformity with official plans and maps and with existing amended plans of the planning commission.
(2)
Continuation of adjoining street system. The proposed street layout shall be coordinated with the street system of the surrounding area. Where possible, existing major streets shall be extended.
(3)
Access to adjacent properties. Where it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property and a temporary turnaround shall be provided. Houses fronting on minor streets shall have access from minor streets only.
(4)
Street names. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name of the proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, regardless of the use of suffix, street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, etc. It shall be unlawful for any person in laying out any new street or road to name such street or road on any plat, by marking or in any deed or instrument, without first getting approval of the county manager or his designee.
(5)
Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
(6)
Trees. It is recommended that as many trees as possible remain on the site during the initial clearing and grading and that trees normally remain unless they lie within a planned public right-of-way, within a planned building site or within the necessary paved areas surrounding or adjacent to the primary structure.
(7)
Railroads and highways (freeways, expressways). Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
a.
In residential districts, a buffer strip not less than 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highways. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be so designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs by the owner. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited."
b.
In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
c.
All other streets which are parallel to the railroad, when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade, shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
(8)
Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets by less than 125 feet shall be prohibited.
(9)
Right angle intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as practicable.
(10)
Cul-de-sac. A cul-de-sac shall not extend more than 800 feet in length and shall provide a turnaround having a roadway radius of not less than 55 feet and a right-of-way radius of not less than 75 feet. Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a turnaround radius of not less than 30 feet.
(11)
Alleys. Service alleys or drives maybe required in multiple dwelling, commercial, and industrial developments and shall have a minimum surface treatment width of 15 feet, but shall not be provided in one-family and two-family residential developments unless the subdivider provides evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys.
(12)
Street right-of-way widths. All roads must be constructed to any and all adopted county engineering standards. Minimum street right-of-way widths shall be as follows:
a.

  Notes:
When inverted crown is used the minimum grade shall not be less than one-half of one percent.
Except for local street, roadway widths shown do not provide for on-street parking; service lanes are intended only for loading and unloading of passengers and goods, and for disabled vehicles and not for the storage of vehicles.
Right-of-way (henceforth referred to as R/W) width listed is for only that portion of the typical section between the limits indicated in diagram. Sloping rights of additional R/W will be required for cut and fill slopes outside these limits; these future slope areas beyond indicated R/W limits should also be kept clear of development until slopes have been constructed.
R/W widths greater than the minimum are encouraged because they make for a safer, more aesthetic and more comfortable facility and permit future roadway widening without disrupting abutting property.

Horizontal curves. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees occurs in the alignment of a marginal access or minor street or road, a curve of reasonable radius shall be introduced. A curve shall be introduced at any change in direction of a collector, industrial or commercial service street or major thoroughfare. On major thoroughfares, a centerline radius of curvature shall be determined by the state department of transportation or county engineer. On collector, industrial or commercial service streets, the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 150 feet unless the topography of the land to be subdivided makes this impractical.
(15)
Street grades. Grades on major thoroughfares should be established by the state department of transportation or county engineer. Grades on collector streets shall not exceed eight percent unless topographic conditions made this impractical. Grades on minor residential streets shall not exceed 15 percent, unless topographic conditions make this impractical. All streets should have a minimum grade of not less than one-half of one percent.
(16)
Access to arterial roads. When a subdivision is proposed with frontage along an existing arterial road or state numbered highway, every attempt must be made to provide an access road or frontage road for direct access to the proposed lots. The planning commission shall evaluate this requirement in an attempt to reduce the number and frequency of curb cuts along arterial roads and state numbered highways.

(1)
Orientation of lot lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to street lines.
(2)
Frontage. Each lot shall have street frontage and shall have access to said street frontage, except as otherwise permitted by this chapter for intra-family land transfers.
(3)
Flag lots.
a.
Intent. Flag lots, as defined in this chapter, are strongly discouraged. However, subdivisions designed with one or more flag lots may be necessary due to the configuration of the lot to be subdivided or to achieve the maximum yield of lots without necessitating the construction of a new or extended street.
b.
Number limited. The zoning administrator in the case of minor subdivisions and the planning commission in the case of major subdivisions shall have due cause to deny any plat that proposes more than one flag lot for every five lots in the subdivision.
c.
Panhandle length restriction. No flag lot shall be allowed to be platted that has a "panhandle" portion (i.e., portion that does not meet the required lot width) that is more than 800 feet in length.
d.
Adequate lot width at building line required. No flag lot shall be approved which fails to meet the lot width required for the zoning district in which the lot is located at the proposed building line.
e.
Prohibition of abutting flag lots. No more than two flag lots shall abut one another in any subdivision.
(4)
Right-of-way dedication. When a major subdivision abuts an existing county road right-of-way, the subdivider shall dedicate and deed land sufficient to provide a 40 foot right-of-way from the centerline of said existing county road. Said dedication shall be required to be shown on the final plat for said subdivision, along with the appropriate dedication statement on the plat.
