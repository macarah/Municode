Sec. 210-70. - OSRD Open Space Residential Development District.
210-70.01
Intent. The OSRD District promotes development strategies for large tracts of land that can help communities preserve open space and natural areas in residential housing developments. The OSRD strategically allows the clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive areas, which in-turn preserves groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat. The clustering of houses and structures also reduces the amount of infrastructure required to serve the development and lessens potential erosion and sedimentation impacts. The OSRD promotes interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the development and supports contiguous greenspace with adjacent communities. Walking trails, bike paths, public gathering places, use of parks and community facilities, as focal points are requirements of an OSRD. Other OSRD standards to promote coherent aesthetics within the community include landscaping requirements, underground utilities, recreational amenities, streetlights, sidewalks, and primary building setbacks. In addition, plans for OSRD approval by the governing authority shall require the provision of a public sewage disposal system as approved by city and state authorities.
An OSRD development must consist of a minimum of 50 contiguous acres of land with at least 40% of the total area designated for open space.
210-70.02
Purpose. The Open Space Residential Development District is a residential district that provides for the proper development of larger tracts of land in a coordinated, well planned manner. The features of this district include the following:
A.
To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure.
B.
To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land.
C.
To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
D.
To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development.
E.
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development.
F.
To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community.
G.
To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions.
H.
To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
I.
To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries.
J.
To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles.
K.
To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space.
L.
To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.

Sec. 210-180. - PSC Planned Shopping Center District.
210-180.01
Purpose and Intent. The PSC District is established to provide locations for retail commercial and service uses which are designed and oriented to serve several neighborhoods making up a community. Projects developed within the PSC zoning district should be done as planned, compact and unified centers. Projects developed within the PSC District should usually occupy a quadrant of an intersection, with ingress and egress only from major streets or State Highways within areas delineated for commercial development on the Future Land Use Plan. Regulations within this district are intended to permit and encourage full development of necessary commercial use, and at the same time protect nearby residential properties from possible adverse effects of such commercial activity. The PSC District is distinguished from other commercial districts by the pre-coordinated aspect of the category to allow planned centers and discourage commercial sprawl. PSC is appropriate in the Community Residential, Corridors and Crossroad Communities Character areas of the Future Development Map of the Paulding County, Georgia 2017 Comprehensive Plan as may be amended.

Purpose and Intent. The I-1 District is established to provide locations for light industrial uses which are on properties delineated within or on the perimeter of an industrial node or compatible area and have ready access to a major street or state Highway. The I-1 district should provide for uses that are low in intensity and scale to ensure compatibility with surrounding properties which makes it desirable to limit industrial operations and processes to those that are not objectionable by reason of the emission of noise, vibration, smoke, dust, gas, fumes, odors and radiation and that do not create fire or explosion hazards or other objectionable conditions. I-1 is appropriate in the Rural, Community Residential, Corridors of the Future Development Map of the Paulding County, Georgia 2017 Comprehensive Plan as may be amended.
