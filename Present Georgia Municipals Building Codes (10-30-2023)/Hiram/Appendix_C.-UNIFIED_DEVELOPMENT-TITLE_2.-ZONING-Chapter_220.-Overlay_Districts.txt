220-20.01
Purpose and Intent. The Corridor Overlay District is intended to establish standards for the design of sites, buildings, structures, plantings, signs, street hardware and such other improvements that are visible to the public and affect the physical development of land within certain designated transportation corridors.
These standards are intended to promote high quality creative development that will combine imagination, innovation and variety in the appearance of buildings and sites in the overlay zone. These standards are further intended to preserve and enhance property values and to promote the public health, safety and welfare by providing for consistent, and coordinated treatment of the property encompassed by the selected transportation corridors.
The following standards shall be considered in evaluating projects proposed within the Corridor Overlay District.
A.
All structures will be evaluated on the overall appearance of the project and shall be based on the quality of its design and its relationship to the surrounding area.
B.
The quality of design goes beyond the materials of construction to include scale, mass, color, proportion, and compatibility with adjoining developments.
C.
Colors shall be harmonious and only the use of compatible accents shall be permitted.
D.
Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves, and parapets, shall have good proportions and relationships to one another.
E.
Any design in which the structure frame is exposed to view, the structural materials shall be compatible within themselves and harmonious with their surroundings.
F.
Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form, and siting shall be used to provide visual interest. In multiple building projects, variable siting or individual buildings may be used to prevent a monotonous appearance.

C.
Therefore, in order to provide safe and sufficient traffic movement to and from adjacent lands and to protect the functional integrity of the corridors primary thoroughfares, in many cases frontage roads, access roads, and distributors roads, will have to be built. Such roads shall be coordinated with those of continuous lots and designed to preserve the aesthetic benefits provided by the greenbelt areas. Access at the side or rear of buildings is encouraged. New access points onto the primary thoroughfares in the corridor shall be coordinated with existing access points whenever possible. The following curb cut policy shall apply throughout all corridors:
D.
Access to proposed developments shall be provided per Georgia Department of Transportation and/or Paulding County Department of Transportation access management standards, policies, guidelines and regulations.
220-20.11
Access to Potential Development Sites. Stub streets shall be built in all cases where adjacent lots have reasonable potential for development. Reasonable potential shall include any adjacent parcel of adequate size for commercial or residential development or any adjacent parcel so determined by the Community Development Department in association with the Paulding County Department of Transportation.
220-20.12
Other Standards.

Sec. 220-30. - Hiram Downtown Historic Overlay District Ordinance—(HOD).
220-30.1
Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of the Hiram Downtown Historic Overlay District (HOD) to establish standards for the design of sites, buildings, structures, plantings, signs, street hardware and such other improvements that are visible to the public and affect the physical development of land within the district. The HOD is intended to promote planned mixed-use development of retail, commercial, office and residential uses in Hiram's downtown.
Hiram's history, architecture, and cultural heritage are among the City's most valued and important assets. The following standards shall be considered by Hiram's Design Review Board (DRB) in evaluating projects for issuance of a "Certificate of Appropriateness" authorizing development within the HOD.
a.
Permitted Uses. Property in the HOD may be used for any use allowed in the underlying zoning district, in addition to a mix of uses identified in this document, unless specifically addressed in this Article, in which case this Article will supersede the allowances of Article VIII of this Ordinance.
b.
Design requirements of proposed developments in the HOD must meet the City of Hiram Design Guidelines as identified herein.
c.
All structures will be evaluated on the overall appearance of the project, quality of its design, and relationship to the surrounding area.
d.
The quality of design goes beyond the materials of construction to include scale, mass, color, proportion, and compatibility with adjoining developments and the HOD.
e.
Building colors shall compliment adjacent and surrounding structures, and only the use of compatible color accents shall be permitted.
f.
Building components, such as windows, doors, awnings, balconies, arcades, stairways, eaves, and parapets, shall have good proportion and relationship to one another and should reflect the existing architectural character and context of the district. For any design in which the structure's frame is exposed to view, the structural materials shall be compatible within themselves and harmonious with their surroundings.
g.
Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form, and siting shall be used to provide visual interest. In multiple building projects, variable siting or individual buildings may be used to prevent a monotonous appearance.
h.
Sidewalks, open space, landscape, lighting, parking layout, streetscape, and site furnishings are all integral and key components of building and constructing within the HOD.
220-30.2
Statement of Intent. In preparing the HOD Ordinance, the intent is to create standards to promote high quality, creative development that will combine imagination, innovation and variety in the appearance of buildings and sites. These standards are further intended to preserve and enhance property values and to promote public health, safety and welfare by providing for consistent and coordinated treatment of the property encompassed by the HOD, while maintaining a sense of Hiram's unique history.
The creation of the HOD will promote developments that will allow the City of Hiram, Georgia, to grow in a positive and sustainable pattern, and will serve to engage families in a friendly family focused hometown.
220-30.3
Authority. Authority underlying creation of the HOD is provided for in Home Rule for municipalities, Ga. Const. Art. IX, Sec. II, Para. II, Municipal Home Rule Act of 1965, O.C.G.A. Section 36-35-1 et seq.
220-30.4
Statement of Significance. Downtown Hiram is a unique village setting. It is a historical place where its town center includes a variety and mix of uses including: institutional, governmental, commercial, retail, residential, and public spaces. The City has celebrated many recent successes including a new government center, renovation of nearby retail buildings, and the implementation of downtown streetscape improvements, as well as new utility (water, sewer, sidewalk and street lighting) infrastructure improvements.
Conveniently located in Paulding County, Hiram is approximately 30 miles northwest of Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and downtown Atlanta. In the past decade, Paulding County and the City of Hiram have experienced significant growth. State Route 92 traverses the county from Douglasville north through the county and Highway 278 is a major east-west retail corridor for all of Paulding County just minutes from downtown. Both state routes are heavily traveled and include sites of varied new developments. Development pressure surrounding and impacting Hiram's downtown area is expected to intensify in the future. If unprotected or unplanned, new development could negatively impact and change the character of Hiram's downtown. It would also create a pedestrian unfriendly environment, which will lessen the quality and character of downtown Hiram, as well as adversely impact the preservation of its historic resources. It is the City's desire that future development in its downtown will create a setting that commands the highest standards of development, encourages efficient use of land, promotes coordinated development and innovative site design, and preserves and builds upon the integrity and historic resources of the community.
Hiram's City Council recognizes that Georgia's downtown areas play a significant role in establishing and maintaining a "sense of place" in their communities. This is especially true when their communities are properly planned, with an engaged citizenry. The community is enthusiastically embracing the desire to preserve its history and to enhance its future growth and development opportunities. The intent of Hiram's Downtown Historic Overlay District is to encourage future development, to project a uniform high-quality appearance, as well as to preserve the unique historic resources and characteristics that are present.
The process of preparing this Ordinance began with the preparation of the Livable Centers Initiative (LCI) master plan. The (LCI) is a regional program administered by Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC). The purpose of the study is aimed at encouraging "smart growth" principles through increased economic investment in existing activity centers and multi-modal focused transportation improvements. In early 2014, ARC awarded the City of Hiram a planning grant to conduct an LCI study focused around the City's historic downtown and to provide recommendations on potential connections to the Silver Comet Trail. The master plan process facilitated a public process to gather community input into shaping and determining the future growth strategies for the Hiram community. The study resulted in feasible recommendations and strategies to make the City of Hiram a desirable community to "Live, Work and Play."
As part of the LCI master planning effort, a series of public meetings were held to obtain community input. The first public meeting was held in August of 2014, during which existing downtown character was discussed and public information was obtained through a Visual Preference Survey (VPS). The survey allowed citizens an opportunity to state what design and development elements they liked or disliked within their downtown and community. The citizens that participated provided input through the VPS. They expressed an interest in promoting developments that will allow the City of Hiram to grow in a positive and in an economically sustainable pattern that was respectful of the existing character. Additional public meetings and workshops were held in November of 2014 and in March of 2015 to help shape the Hiram LCI master plan. One of the recommendations from the master plan report included preparing a central business district ordinance. This ordinance would recognize and promote the unique characteristics and qualities that make Downtown Hiram distinctive to promote future development.
During and after the completion of the LCI master plan, City leaders continued to reach out to the Hiram community and held three additional public meetings in April and July of 2017, to discuss the issues and importance associated with the HOD for the Hiram downtown. The powerful sense of continuity with the past and the desire to continue those characteristics and standards into the future were voiced by the community. Standards included: regulatory controls, design guidelines for building development and materials, parking areas, signage, vehicular and pedestrian transportation, greenspace, landscape, and vegetation protection. By creating the HOD, the community expressed its desire to:
a.
Preserve and improve the quality of life for the residents of Hiram;
b.
Promote and enhance the economic viability of downtown Hiram;
c.
Create a sense of pride in the City among its citizens;
d.
Create job opportunities in Hiram;
e.
Provide incentives to develop larger parcels, in a coordinated and planned approach;
f.
Encourage adaptive reuse of abandoned, vacant or underutilized buildings or structures where appropriate;
g.
Promote a mixture of uses that support a walkable environment that strengthens downtown business;
h.
Create important and interesting gathering places for visitors, residents and workers in downtown;
i.
Retain its visual character derived from topography, woodlands, and riparian corridors;
j.
Promote growth strategies that encourage infill and redevelopment;
k.
Maintain a consistently elevated level of design quality throughout the district by blending historic architectural characteristics with creative design;
l.
Maintain the integrity, charm and history of Hiram's architecture and downtown;
m.
Promote continuity in future development;
n.
Allow for a mix of new land uses that are appropriate to both the needs of the community and the scale of surrounding neighborhoods;
o.
Allow for diversity and multi-generational uses that provide a variety of retail experiences, where people want to come and shop;
p.
Create a pleasant and safe experience for all that come to the City of Hiram.

220-30.8
Land use, density, permissable and non-permissible uses.
1.
Land Use. Hiram's Downtown Historic Overlay District is envisioned to accommodate a mix of proposed uses that are compact and pedestrian-oriented. Land uses may include the following: retail, commercial, family entertainment (e.g., restaurants, cafes), office, civic, institutional, lodging, and residential development (attached and detached). Proposed sole use should be the exception and not the norm. Within neighborhoods, a range of housing types and price levels should be provided, consistent with the 2015 Livable Centers Initiative (LCI) Final Report, to accommodate diverse ages and incomes. A range in type and size of open space should be distributed within the HOD. Retail uses may not include uses or features oriented to automobile use, such as drive-thru facilities, gas stations, or automotive sales or repair.
2.
Non-Conforming Uses. Certain existing uses may be rendered non-conforming upon the enactment of the HOD. At the adoption of the HOD, existing uses that are non-conforming shall be permitted to remain, until a change in property ownership occurs at which time, a non-conforming use shall be modified to comply with the requirements of the HOD. The Design Review Board shall determine which modifications are required in order for the property to come in compliance with the HOD.
3.
Rezoning Requirements. Properties that typically require a zoning approval from the City of Hiram City Council will first be required to obtain a "Certificate of Appropriateness" from the City of Hiram Design Review Board prior to making zoning application to the County. Typically, properties which are adding a mix of residential, office, commercial, retail or civic uses will be considered acceptable uses within the HOD, however, a review by the City of Hiram's Design Review Board to determine whether the applicant's proposed development meets the intent of the HOD is required. Non-conforming uses shall also be brought into compliance with the HOD upon any rezoning approval.
4.
Density. The HOD is envisioned to accommodate and encourage higher density residential, retail and office space. Proposed residential development should be in the form of Fee Simple multi-family residential, townhouses, garden homes, condominiums, and live work space. The district is envisioned to accommodate pedestrian oriented retail development on the ground floor with office or residential uses above on second and third floors. The maximum density for commercial, retail and office development within the HOD is Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of .5 or 20,000 square feet per acre. For residential development, a maximum of 12 units per acre is allowed. Development should be designed in a manner that promotes a 'village' character. Additional density may be considered acceptable if the Design Review Board determines that it is in the best interest of the City of Hiram and can meet the overall goals of the HOD Ordinance to preserve and promote the character of Hiram's historic downtown. Proposed development plans in the HOD should incorporate the following requirements:
a.
A consistent streetscape character, including active store fronts and future retail space;
b.
The preservation of existing specimen trees to the greatest extent possible is required, and supplemented to promote a 'tree-lined' street appearance;
c.
The fronts of buildings must face the street;
d.
Reduction or avoidance of multiple curb cuts and disruption to the sidewalk;
e.
Parking and garages shall be located at the rear of the site or buildings;
f.
Provision of a variety of residential types, including attached and detached products;
g.
Development shall include accessory structures, such as sculptures, focal point features and fountains, greenspace, and parks within the District to enhance their use and enjoyment;
h.
Sidewalks sized appropriately for retail or residential use. See sidewalk design guidelines for guidance;
i.
Landscape and lighting in accordance with the design guidelines established within this Ordinance.
5.
Height. The maximum height for buildings within the HOD is 3 stories, or 40 feet to the eave/parapet whichever is less. For the purposes of this section, height shall be measured from finished grade at the front of the building to the eave or parapet. Buildings that may have a rear foundation, the maximum height of buildings can be extended to account for height of the exposed foundation, or no more than 14 additional feet.
6.
Setbacks. The front, rear and side setbacks within the HOD are conditional and based on balancing the goals of the HOD with the proposed development plan. The Design Review Board will evaluate all proposed setbacks (front, side and rear) to determine if they achieve the proposed goals of the HOD. At a minimum, the front setback of all buildings shall provide for an enhanced streetscape experience including the following: adequate greenbelt for street tree planting, street lighting, site furnishing and appropriate sidewalk width. Applicants shall refer to sidewalk standards outlined in this Ordinance for building setbacks from back of curb. All Georgia State, Federal and International Fire Codes and Standards apply. Development within 50 feet of a common property line abutting residential development, which is in existence prior to the adoption of these regulations shall provide a minimum fifteen-foot landscaped buffer and eight-foot high privacy fencing.
7.
Maximum Site Coverage. The maximum site coverage (including building, hardscape and parking) in the District for any development is 80%. A minimum of 20% open space shall be provided. Open space shall take the form of a park, green, plaza, square, or greenway designed in accordance with landscape design guidelines.
8.
Minimum Size Requirements—Floor Area. For detached residential units a minimum of 1,400 square feet shall be provided as finished living space. For attached fee simple multi-family residential, townhouse, and condominium space, the minimum finished living space shall be 850 square feet. The minimum width for detached single-family buildings is 30 feet wide and the minimum building width for attached fee simple, multi- and single- family residential development is 20 feet wide.

d.
Adequate Public Facilities. The existence of adequate public facilities helps to coordinate the timing and provision of public infrastructure with new development. The Design Review Board, and or the City of Hiram governing authority, may delay or deny new development projects by prohibiting the issuance of development permits if existing government services/utilities, such as water, sewer, roads, schools, fire, police, etc., cannot support the proposed development. Before the developer can apply for development permits, they must be able to show that there are adequate resources currently available in the community.
220-30.9
Zoning designation and process.
1.
Land developed in accordance with this document shall be shown on the official zoning map with the letters 'HOD' (Historic Overlay District) added to the zoning designation for that property. For example, property zoned 'B-2' and developed in accordance with this document shall be shown as 'B-2 HOD' on the official zoning map.
2.
These incentive zoning regulations create an additional layer of review by the City of Hiram, Design Review Board. Since the incentive zoning regulations are used in place of the existing zoning regulations (except for requirements not addressed in this document), the plan review and permitting process remains unchanged. For this reason, plans that comply with these regulations for property that is not subject to rezoning will be reviewed in accordance with standard plan review procedures. Properties required to be rezoned are subject to the standard public hearing process prior to plan review and permitting.
3.
Zoning Classifications Permitted. The following existing zoning classifications along with their respective district regulations, (except as superseded herein), shall be permitted for properties within the HOD: R-2 (Suburban Residential), R-4 (Multi-Family Non Fee Simple (Rental) Residential), R-7 (Multi-Family Fee Simple (Non-Rental) Residential), LRO (Low Rise Office), O-I (Office and Institutional), NB (Neighborhood Business), B-1 (General Business), and some uses under B-2 (Highway Business) with a Special Use Permit.
220-30.10
Building design standards.
1.
Building Design Requirements. The purpose of the Building Design Standards is to encourage aesthetically pleasing buildings, which match the architectural character within the HOD. Buildings should complement adjoining structures and reflect a prominent level of architectural quality. The building style should be of a pedestrian scale and take into consideration the context of the district and adjacent building details, including design elements such as materials, colors, and proportions. All buildings shall comply with City Code of Ordinances, Chapter 10 Building Regulations, Article I and II (with the following exceptions, indicated in Sec. F item 12), and with the Building Design Standards, outlined within the HOD.
2.
Exterior, Colors and Materials. Building exterior finish materials shall be applied to all sides of a building that are visible to the public. The use of each material shall be an appropriate expression of the characteristics of that material.
a.
Colors and textures shall be compatible with colors of other buildings in the vicinity and the nearby surroundings. The general nature of colors used shall be natural, earth tones. Accent colors may be used with discretion where appropriate in ornamental locations, but not as primary building material colors. A dominant color shall not be a primary color. The use of metallic, black or florescent colors is prohibited.
b.
Building materials shall be native stone, brick, cultured stone or cast stone, architectural finished block (burnished, split face concrete masonry units), architectural finished pre-cast wall (profiled, cultured, or with architectural finish), poured-in-place walls, exterior insulation and finish system (EIFS but not less than four feet above grade), and architectural glass (less than 25 reflectance) or combinations of no more than two of these finish types. Typically, no building material shall cover more than 80 percent of the front façade of any building.
c.
Stone material used for masonry construction may consist of granite, sandstone, slate, limestone, marble, or other hard or durable all-weather stone. Ashlar, cut stone, and dimensioned stone construction techniques are acceptable.
d.
Brick material used for masonry construction shall be composed of hard fired (Kiln-fired) all weather standard size brick or other all-weather facing brick.
e.
Glass Walls. Glass walls, which shall include glass curtain walls or glass block construction, are prohibited. Glass curtain walls shall be defined as an exterior wall which carries no floor or roof loads, and which may consist of a combination of metal, glass and other surfacing materials supported in a metal framework.
f.
Wood Construction. The exposed walls and roofs of buildings shall be maintained in a clean, orderly, and attractive condition, free of cracks, dents, punctures, breakage, and other forms of visible marring. Materials that become excessively faded, chalked or otherwise deteriorated shall be refinished, repainted, or replaced.
g.
The following materials shall not be acceptable for exterior cladding of buildings: exposed standard concrete blocks, prefabricated metal buildings, weeping mortar joints, unnatural brick tones, corrugated steel, plywood, aluminum, plastic siding, vinyl siding, exposed aggregate, and or reflective glass.
h.
Murals may be allowed, by sign permit, and issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness.
3.
Facades Articulation. Facades play a key role in setting the stage for the HOD. The building facade evokes immediate expressions about the quality of the development. Articulated facades provide visual interest to the building and highlight the importance of entries, display windows, outdoor dining, and overall quality. Façade articulation characteristics will ultimately depend on what type of use is proposed within the HOD. Buildings shall be considered in context within the HOD and are expected to share similar architectural features and visual continuity between buildings. In all cases, façade articulation of buildings shall reduce the scale of the buildings and provide visual interest that is more consistent with the HOD character. All buildings shall avoid oversimplified one dimensional facades and should exhibit human scale characteristics. Buildings within the HOD are required to share at least five Architectural Features and similar Accent Features to create continuity. These features are listed hereafter:
a.
Architectural Features.
i.
Canopies or porticos.
ii.
Recesses/projections.
iii.
Arcades and balconies.
iv.
Raised corniced parapets over entrances.
v.
Peaked roof forms.
vi.
Arches.
vii.
Outdoor patios.
viii.
Tower elements.
ix.
Display windows.
x.
Water features.
xi.
Public art.
xii.
Low garden/courtyard walls.
b.
Accent Features.
i.
Overhanging eaves.
ii.
Banding.
iii.
Pilasters.
iv.
Articulated parapets.
v.
Cornices.
vi.
Columns.
vii.
String courses.
viii.
Projecting windows.
ix.
Window sills.
x.
Lintels.
xi.
Porches.
All structures shall be architecturally finished on all sides that are visible from streets, pedestrian walkways, parking lots, or structured parking. The rear façade of a building, visible from public streets, parking lots, or pedestrian walkways, shall not be a blank wall. In general, large, monolithic expanses of uninterrupted facades are not allowed.
4.
Building Massing. Due to the numerous uses that are allowed within the HOD, proposed building sizes and masses should be varied. Building entries must be articulated and expressed in greater architectural detail than other portions of the building. Because it is the first point that most people perceive the building at an intimate scale, an entryway is a key architectural element. All public entries shall be built to reflect human and pedestrian scale characteristics.
a.
Recessed or projected areas, building height changes, material changes, awnings, canopies, balconies, porticos, and low garden/courtyard walls are essential elements to be used in focusing attention to a building entry. Entryways and storefronts should be addressed to activate and enliven the street while providing an opportunity to create a unique entry for a tenant. Recesses and projections in the building shall also be provided and will create the opportunity to break up long facades and building sizes. They will provide the opportunity to identify important architectural features of a building, provide visual interest to a building, and help to organize and unify buildings within the HOD.
b.
Building Corner Treatments. Buildings shall reinforce a strong and pronounced corner condition at street intersections to emphasize the streetscape and building character. Tower elements and other changes in the building height are also key features in breaking up the monotony of long building facades and should be used in a visually pleasing way to enhance or accentuate important corners, entrances or gateways into the District, or to mark building entries.
c.
Consideration should be used in design and placement of towers and changes in building height to articulate the development in a visually pleasing way.
d.
Typically, to ensure a minimum level of street wall volume consistency, all buildings shall have a minimum height of 20 feet measured above the finish floor grade to the top of the roof structure.
e.
Massing of buildings should acknowledge the size of adjacent structures. Any changes should relate to the primary and secondary facades, the structural rhythm, and the hierarchy of the use of the building.
f.
Typically, buildings to be developed in the HOD are intended to be located to create a streetscape image occupied by outdoor dining, kiosks, and other similar permitted uses and structures. The minimum development street frontage/build to line for these buildings should be 15 feet from the back of curb. This would allow for a streetscape furnishings zone (five-foot width) and safe pedestrian walkway (ten-foot width) to be accommodated. To create interest in the buildings, their setback distance from the back of the curb to the face of the building may also vary. Upper level setbacks may be considered; however, it should not be a continuous setback. The ratio of upper level setbacks must be considered with regard to the building proportions and scale. For example, 70 percent of total building street frontage shall be located at the front setback, and the remainder 30 percent may be recessed several feet to create interest.
g.
The desired maximum building length for commercial and retail buildings shall not be longer than 240 feet without an unconnected physical separation of at least 10 feet between another building or as necessary to meet National Fire Codes. This separation can be the location of a pedestrian walkway.
h.
Office buildings and other special uses buildings will be reviewed and approved on an individual basis by the Design Review Board.
i.
Any building feature defined as an attachment may not encroach more than five feet from the building face and the minimum setback of 15 feet from the back of curb to the face of the building shall be provided. Building features described as attachments include:
i.
Stoops.
ii.
Chimneys.
iii.
Awnings.
iv.
Porches.
v.
Canopies.
vi.
Eaves.
vii.
Tower elements.
viii.
Pilasters.
ix.
Bay windows.
x.
Mounted signs.
xi.
Balconies.
5.
Window and Glazing Treatment. The treatment of exterior windows shall be reviewed and controlled for uniformity in appearance. Commercial and retail storefront and display windows are important in how the contents of a store or restaurant are viewed and advertised. The display of merchandise in a storefront window, or the visual ambiance of a restaurant is important to the success of each business. Windows should facilitate the opportunity for these visual business marketing aspects. The following guidance shall be followed:
a.
Architectural glass, less than 25 percent reflectance for nonresidential and mixed-use buildings.
b.
The ground floor level of all nonresidential and mixed-use buildings, visible from the any street, roadway, pedestrian walkway, or parking lot, shall have a minimum of 40 percent transparency.
6.
Roof Treatment. Roofs normally visible to the public shall be treated with an architectural material that is compatible with the primary building material and acceptable to the Design Review Board. Variations in the roof lines shall be used to add interest and reduce the scale of larger buildings.
a.
Roof Forms. Roof forms contribute to the massing, scale and proportions of all buildings and manipulation of the roof forms can distinguish between internal units such as residential and commercial structures. The length of any roof on a primary façade may be broken up using dormers, gables, or hip roofs.
i.
Flat roofs shall require parapets, which adhere to the articulation requirements of the main façade. Parapets are essential elements that help frame and complete the architectural feel of any building. The average height of a parapet shall not exceed 15 percent of the supporting walls, unless rooftop equipment cannot be sufficiently screened. Three-dimension cornice treatment is encouraged for parapets.
ii.
Overhanging eaves shall extend no more than three feet past the supporting walls.
iii.
Pitched roofs shall have a minimum pitch of 6/12. This excludes roofs for dormers, shed and entries.
iv.
Architectural elements that add visual interest to the roof such as dormers and masonry chimneys are encouraged.
v.
Roof gables should be in the same plane as the primary building façade except where the roofs are articulated. Roof eaves should meet and project beyond the primary façade to create horizontal rhythm. To enhance pedestrian flow and visibility, buildings at corners can be angled or rounded.
b.
Roof Materials. Roofing shall not be reflective or light in color. Asphalt shingles are not permitted unless for the residential buildings.
7.
Building Utility Screening. Building utilities such as mechanical and electrical equipment attached to or mounted on a building must be located out of view from public areas. Such equipment should be grouped together in an orderly manner, and screened in a manner compatible with the overall treatment, materials, and colors of the building exterior. Exposed equipment must be painted to match a darker value of the primary architectural colors of the building. Rooftop equipment should be located either in the center of the roof or in one corner away from the street elevation so as not to be visible from the primary or secondary approach. Trash, refuse, and waste removal areas, loading berths, service yards, storage yards, and exterior work areas shall be screened from view from public ways.
8.
Exterior Architectural Features. Plazas, courtyards, patios, and similar exterior areas that are integral to a building must be constructed of materials like or compatible with the primary building. Service areas and open storage areas contiguous to the structure must be constructed of materials identical to the primary building.
9.
Building Lighting. Exterior building lighting should be carefully designed to accent the building structure and form and to provide safe night lighting at entrances and public walkways. Fixtures should be contextual with the building and adjacent building designs. Building lighting should focus on providing light on building signs and enhancing architectural details on the façade. Light trespass off site should be minimized or avoided.
10.
Awnings and Banners. Awning scale and proportions are to be appropriate for the building on which they are mounted as well as complementary to the adjacent structures. Awnings should be uniform in size, shape and color to unify multiple storefronts within a single building or to emphasize and protect building entrances. The length of the awning should not exceed 40 linear feet. The vertical and horizontal dimension should be proportional to the overall projection of the awning. An awning shall not extend more than 4 feet over sidewalks.
a.
Awnings should be placed at a minimum height of 9 feet above the sidewalk and can be fixed or retractable. The awning material should be taut, not relaxed and may include matte finish painted army duck, vinyl-coated cotton, acrylic-coated polyester, and vinyl-coated polyester.
b.
Colors for awnings and banners must consider the color selection of the surrounding materials, buildings, signs, awnings, and image of the retailer/user and district. Colors should enhance and compliment the building and are restricted to earth tones and primary and secondary colors.
c.
All large canopies that require structural columns for support shall have a minimum of three feet of masonry (or other approved material) finish measured from grade. All awnings, canopies, and banners must meet minimum wind resistance standards of the local and state building code.
11.
Relationship of Buildings to Site. The streetscape encompasses the public right-of-way, its associated vehicular lanes and public frontages, and the private building frontages that frame it. These elements make up a significant percentage of a community's public realm and the overall visual impression of a community. The streetscape can be a destination in and of itself, and its design significantly shapes a community's form and how that community functions. Private buildings and frontages frame the public right-of-way, giving shape to the streetscape through building placement and design controls on building façades and spaces. The building site shall be planned to accomplish a desirable transition between the site and the streetscape, and provide for adequate planting, safe pedestrian movement, and parking.
a.
Site planning in which setbacks and yards are excessive is discouraged. Minimal distance should be provided to create interesting relationships between buildings.
b.
Parking areas shall be treated with decorative elements, building wall extensions, plantings, berms, or other innovative means to attractively landscape and/or screen parking areas from views from public ways.
c.
The height and scale of each building shall be compatible with its site and existing (or anticipated) adjoining buildings.
d.
Newly installed utility services, and service revisions necessitated by exterior alterations, shall be underground.
e.
Minimum Building Height: All uses shall have a minimum 2 story building height.
12.
Fences.
a.
Height of rear yard fences are limited to eight feet in height;
b.
Height of front fence is limited to three-and-a-half feet height;
c.
Height of side fences is limited to six feet in height;
d.
Wood frontage fences shall be painted or stained;
e.
When erected on a lot line, all of the fence and any of its supporting structures shall be contained within the lot;
f.
Stone, walls and metal fences, shall include sealed drawings by a structural engineer or architect;
g.
Chain Link, barbed wire, or hog/horse wire fences are prohibited in the HOD.
220-30.10
Signage standards. The intent of the design standards is to establish a cohesive, distinctive and functional signage system to visually attract and communicate with visitors, employees, and the community when in the HOD. The signage and graphics system planned in the HOD should complement the established City of Hiram project signage. Signs must be permitted through the City of Hiram, and be accompanied by a Certificate of Appropriateness. The intent of these guidelines is that collectively there will be a consistent visual language for public and private signage.
A list of the acceptable and non-acceptable signage types is indicated in this Ordinance. The applicant shall provide the proposed signage for Design Review Board review and approval. At a minimum, all signs shall meet the applicable standards established in the City of Hiram UDO, TITLE 4: SIGNS, Chapter 600—Sign Ordinance, including permitting requirements.
The allowable sign types for the HOD include:

Landscaping plan. A landscaping plan shall be submitted to the Design Review Board, at the same time other plans are being reviewed (i.e., architectural design, lighting, parking, signage, and site plans) for approval. This plan shall be drawn to scale, including dimensions and distance, shall delineate all existing and proposed structures, private parking areas, walks, ramps for handicapped access, terraces, driveways, signs, lighting standards, steps, walls, and patios, and other similar structures; and shall delineate the location, size, and description of all landscape materials. Landscape treatment for plazas, roads, paths, service and private parking areas shall be designed as an integral and coordinated part of the landscape plan for the entire lot. Detailed information may be requested by the Design Review Board/Community Development Department to obtain the final Certificate of Appropriateness.
1.
Description of Plant Material Species and Required Sizes. Trees, shrubs and ground covers shall be of a variety that is indigenous to the surrounding area. It is required that a registered landscape architect be consulted to choose or approve the proper tree species and prepare the design. Tree species shall be noted on landscape drawing submittals and are subject to approval by the Design Review Board.
2.
Landscape treatment shall be provided to enhance and complement architectural features, strengthen vistas and lines of site and provide shade. Landscape areas shall be protected from vehicles by appropriate curbs, or other devices wherever possible. Where building sites limit planting, the placement of trees and shrubs in the parkways or paved areas is encouraged.
3.
Screening of service yards, exterior utilities (includes generators, cooling towers and condensers, etc.) refuse collection areas and other places which tend to be unsightly shall be accomplished using walls, fencing, landscaping or any approved combination of these. Screening shall be effective in winter and summer seasons. Vehicular parking areas, service areas, and driveways shall be shielded from adjacent properties and public rights-of-way using effective screening mechanisms such as landscaped earthen berms, lowering the parking level grade below sight lines from public right-of-way, and using evergreen screen landscaping.
4.
Every effort shall be made to respect and preserve existing Specimen trees on site. A Specimen tree is a particularly impressive or unusual example of a species due to its size, shape, age, or any other trait that epitomizes the character of the species.
a.
Specimen Tree is any tree, in moderate to good condition, which qualifies for special consideration for preservation due to size, species, or condition, and which meets the following DBH (diameter at breast height):
•
9" DBH - Small trees (dogwood, sourwood, cherry, etc.).
•
24" DBH - Overstory hardwoods (oak, hickory, sweet gum, ash, etc.).
•
32" DBH - Overstory softwoods (pine, etc.).
b.
Specimen Trees Not to be Removed. Unless there is documentation of economic hardship, dead, dying, diseased or hazardous trees, specimen trees shall not be removed from HOD. Specimen trees proposed to be removed from the HOD that are in good health, shall be replanted with similar caliper inches, i.e., one, 30-inch hardwood tree to be removed, shall require replanting 10 - 3" caliper trees.
c.
Site Density Factor. The total site density factor (existing and proposed trees) of no less than 40 caliper inches, per acre are required within the HOD. Applicant shall submit a plan that identifies the specimen trees to be removed and the specimen trees to remain in place and the proposed trees to meet the Site Density Factor.
5.
Plant materials are encouraged to be indigenous or naturalizing but not of exotic origin to this region and climate. Care should be taken in selection of plant materials that do not require excessive irrigation or maintenance. Scale and proportion of the building should be considered. Landscaping should be utilized to complement architecture of buildings, structures and monument signs and soften or screen views of parking areas from public rights-of-way. Equal attention shall be given to landscaping along the sides and rear of buildings as well as the front elevation.
6.
A list of approved trees, shrubs and ground covers has been selected for landscape use. It is intended that through consistent, repeated use of these species, the overall development of the community will be unified. The landscape elements to be used fall into the following categories:
a.
Shade Trees shall be full-headed deciduous specimens, a minimum of 3 inches in caliper or larger. They shall be used for shade or features, either individually or in clusters.
b.
Street Trees are herein defined as trees, on either side of all streets, avenues, or rights-of-way. Street trees shall be a minimum of 3-inch caliper size for deciduous trees. A preferred street tree type is to be selected for a road and used continuously along the corridor. Trees typically shall be planted 50 feet on center. Small flowering and ornamental trees can be utilized at intersections or used in addition to the Street Trees to provide accent and color.
c.
Evergreen Trees shall be used in masses of general background planting, or for screening and framing buildings or views. They may also be used as massed, freestanding elements for special effects. Minimum height for these specimens shall be 7-8 feet in height.
d.
Small Flowering/Ornamental Trees shall be grouped in randomly arranged clusters as foreground plantings. They may also be grouped for accents or other effects requiring seasonal color. Planted a minimum of 1½ inch caliper and typically a maximum of 25 feet on center.
e.
Evergreen or Deciduous Shrubs shall be massed for screening, background, planters or foundation planting. They may be used as freestanding elements as low landscape features, but should always be used in masses or groups. These shrubs shall be a minimum of 3 gallon plants and planted according to spread characteristics.
f.
Foundation Planting are plantings that are adjacent to the buildings and are normally low to medium in height. They also help bring the building's edges to the ground to provide a more pleasing and seamless transition. Plants are normally a mix of evergreens, shrubs and perennials. Foundation planting shrubs shall be a minimum of 3 gallons in size and perennials shall be planted at a minimum of 1 gallon size, ground cover shall be planted a minimum 2.5" pot. Plant spacing shall follow Nursery Industry standards.
g.
Hedges are used to define the property lines and the public realm, and to differentiate between property lots. Planned properly, using a combination of groundcovers, shrubs and ornamental grass, hedges can be used to define outdoor rooms of yards. Hedge height varies depending on site location and conditions. Hedges should be planted with a minimum of 3 gallon plants.
h.
Ground Covers shall be used on all slopes steeper than 2.5 to 1. They may also be used in flat areas either alone or in combination with other plant materials for a massed effect. They may also be used to aid in erosion control as well as visual appearance. Plants shall be a minimum 2.5" pot. Plant spacing shall follow Nursery Industry standards.
i.
Grasses shall be planted as seed or sod to form lawns wherever practical, i.e., slopes of 2.5 to 1 or less. Lawns may be interrupted only by paving, trees, or the mulched beds of other planting materials.
j.
Earth Berms and Mounds are intended to create a soft, gentle rolling effect on an otherwise flat plane. They are to gradually taper into the surrounding area from a maximum slope of 3 to 1 and should have softly rounded tops for ease in mowing. When used repeatedly, mounds should create an irregular natural appearance with variations in both height and width. They are recommended as screening devices, with or without plant materials, to lessen the visual impact of service and parking areas. They may also be used where practical in front of setback areas for a soft visual effect. Although they may be used in combination with plant groupings, mounds are to be planted mainly in grass, with only clustered plant or tree groupings emerging.
7.
Recommended Plant List. The following list constitutes the recommended Plant Material for the HOD.
a.
Small Flowering/Ornamental Trees (less than 30 feet tall at maturity).
