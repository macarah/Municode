Animal means any type of domestic animal commonly kept as a pet including, but not limited to, dogs and cats.

Animal shelter means any facility operated by any governmental entity, humane society, or other organization for the purpose of impounding or caring for animals held under the authority of this chapter or state law.
At large. An animal is considered at large when it is not under control as provided in this chapter.
Auctions means any place or facility where animals are regularly bought, sold or traded, except for those facilities otherwise defined in this chapter. Individual sales of animals by owners are not auctions as defined in this chapter.

Fenced enclosure means an enclosure made of wire, wood, stone or other materials which is of sufficient height and strength to act as a barrier against the passage of the animal it is intended to enclose. An "invisible fence" is not an acceptable fenced enclosure for an animal.
Hobby breeder means a person who offers for sale one litter of animals during a 12-month period per household. A household which sells two litters during a 12-month period, even if the litters are produced from different animals, will not be considered a hobby breeder and will be subject to the registration procedures applicable to animal establishments and breeders as designated in this chapter.
Humane manner means care of an animal to include, but not to be limited to, adequate heat, ventilation, sanitary shelter, wholesome fresh food, and access to fresh, clean, wholesome water at all times, consistent with the normal requirements and feeding habits of the animal's size, species and breed.
Kennel means any premises where any person who engages in the business of boarding, breeding, buying, letting for hire, training for a fee or selling animals, excluding licensed veterinarians and veterinary clinics and hospitals and facilities owned and/or operated by government entities.
Neutered means incapable of sexual reproduction.
Nuisance. An animal shall be considered a nuisance if it:
(1)
Damages, soils, defiles or defecates on private property (other than the property of the owner of the animal), or public property and recreational areas;
(2)
Causes unsanitary, dangerous or offensive conditions;
(3)
Causes a disturbance by excessive barking or other noise making;

Owner means any person who has title to or the right to possession of an animal, including, but not limited to, the caretaker or custodian of any animal or person harboring or having control of an animal.

Any animal shall be considered under control if it is on the property and/or premises of its owner, or is secured by a leash, chain, or lead of sufficient strength to prevent it from escaping from its owner when away from the premises of the owner. An animal may be considered under control if the owner is accompanying the animal and has voice, whistle or other control over such animal and such animal is trained to respond to such voice, whistle or other control. The burden of proving that an animal is trained to respond to voice, whistle or other control remains with the owner of such animal and a rebuttable presumption exists that an animal which is not confined to the premises of its owner without being secured by a chain, leash or lead of sufficient strength or fence to prevent it from escaping is not under control of its owner.

If the animal attack involves the biting of a person or another animal, the attack shall also be reported to the county animal control office.

Any owner of a female animal in heat (capable to be bred and become pregnant) shall confine such animal in a building or secure enclosure (sufficient to prevent the female animal in heat from escaping and to prevent another animal from entering the enclosure) to prevent breeding. Any female animal in heat roaming loose or tethered without the protection of a fence or barrier will be in violation of this chapter.

Any owner of a vicious animal shall confine it within a building or secured enclosure (sufficient to prevent the animal from escaping and to prevent a person or another animal from entering the enclosure) and will not remove it from such building or fenced enclosure unless it is securely muzzled and under restraint by a person who is at least 18 years of age or older.
