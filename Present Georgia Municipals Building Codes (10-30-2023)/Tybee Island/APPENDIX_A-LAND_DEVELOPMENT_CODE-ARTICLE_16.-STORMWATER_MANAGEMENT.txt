(c)
The post-development peak rate of runoff cannot exceed the predevelopment peak rate of runoff for the one-, five-, ten-, and 25-year 24-hour events. Exception to this requirement shall be made for single-family homes provided that post-development run-off does not exceed one cubic feet per second (CFS). Exception shall also be made for single family lots that lie within a subdivision with an approved drainage plan.
(d)
In all submittals, if drainage calculations indicate that post-development runoff will exceed predevelopment runoff, then on-site detention for the one-, five-, ten-, and 25-year 24-hour events is required at a discharge rate equal to or less than the pre-developed 24-hour peak rate of discharge for all storm events from the one-, five-, ten-, and including the 25-year event, or the capacity of the existing downstream conveyance system must be upgraded in capacity to accommodate the additional 25-year, 24-hour discharge generated by the new development. On projects that lie within drainage basins for which the city believes to have insufficient outfall or has knowledge of flooding that would be intensified by the proposed development, the 50- and 100-year events will also be considered in the drainage and drainage calculations. Where outfall is not existing or feasible, the city may allow retention. Stormwater management by retention will be for all events up to and including the 100-year storm.

This division is linked with existing stormwater management manuals including the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, the Coastal Stormwater Supplement and local design manuals that provide the technical specifications for stormwater system design.
(Ord. No. 42-2014, § 1, 10-10-2014)
Subdivision 1. - General Provisions

Sec. 16-250. - Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes, and pollutant loads, and increase flooding channel erosion, and pollutant transport and deposition in rivers and streams;
(2)
Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes, and pollutant loads, and consequently, alter water levels and fluctuations and increase pollutant transport and deposition in wetlands;
(3)
Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes, and pollutant loads, and alter salinity concentrations and fluctuations and increase productivity and pollutant transport and deposition in estuaries;
(4)
Land development activities and alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes, and pollutant loads, and increase bacteria transport and deposition in near coastal waters, which leads to beach contamination and closure and poses a serious threat to human health;
(5)
Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and, consequently, decreasing the amount of rainfall that is available to recharge shallow groundwater aquifers;
(6)
The negative impacts of land development activities on these important local aquatic resources can adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of the general public;
(7)
The negative impacts of land development can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff rates, volumes, and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites;
(8)
Communities within the coastal nonpoint source management area are required to comply with a number of state and federal regulations that require the adverse impacts of increased stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads to be controlled and minimized;
(9)
Therefore, the city has determined that it is in the public interest to control and minimize the adverse impacts of land development activities and has established this set of stormwater management provisions to regulate post-construction stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites.
(Ord. No. 42-2014, § 1, 10-10-2014)
Sec. 16-260. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this division is to protect and maintain the integrity of local aquatic resources, and, consequently, the health, safety and welfare of the general public, by establishing minimum stormwater management provisions that control and minimize the adverse impacts of land development activities. This division seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of local aquatic resources;
(2)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria that will reduce flooding, channel erosion, and pollutant transport and deposition in local aquatic resources;
(3)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria that will help preserve existing hydrologic conditions and development and redevelopment sites;
(4)
Establish design criteria for structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria;
(5)
Encourage the use of better site planning, better site design and low impact development practices to the maximum extent practical at development and redevelopment sites;
(6)
Establish provisions for the long-term upkeep and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed and pose no threat to public safety; and,
(7)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved land development projects.
(Ord. No. 42-2014, § 1, 10-10-2014)

Sec. 16-430. - Runoff reduction.
(a)
Some portion of the stormwater runoff generated on a development or redevelopment site shall be captured and retained, reused, or otherwise reduced in order to preserve and/or replicate pre-development site hydrology, recharge shallow groundwater aquifers, promote baseflow to on-site and downstream aquatic resources, and minimize the water quality impacts of land development. A stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
(1)
It is designed to capture and retain, reuse, or otherwise reduce the prescribed runoff reduction volume from the site, as defined in the latest edition of the Coastal Stormwater Supplement;
(2)
Appropriate structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices that provide for the interception, evaporation, transpiration, passive infiltration, active (engineered) infiltration, extended filtration, and capture and reuse of stormwater runoff have been selected, designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the standards, criteria, and information presented in the latest edition of the Coastal Stormwater Supplement; and,
(3)
Stormwater runoff from any development or redevelopment site that is defined by the city as a stormwater hotspot is not managed through the use of structural or nonstructural stormwater management practices that provide for passive or active (engineered) infiltration of stormwater runoff, unless adequate pre-treatment is provided, as defined by the city.
(b)
Green infrastructure, which includes better site planning and design techniques and low impact development practices, shall be used to the maximum extent practical during the site planning and design process to capture and retain, reuse, or otherwise reduce the prescribed runoff reduction volume on a development or redevelopment site.
(c)
The city may reduce or waive the runoff reduction requirements on a development or redevelopment site with high groundwater, groundwater recharge areas, tight or contaminated soils, or other site constraints that prevent the use of one or more runoff reduction processes. When seeking a reduction in or waiver from runoff reduction requirements, the applicant shall demonstrate that structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices that provide for the interception, evaporation, transpiration, passive infiltration, active (engineered) infiltration, extended filtration, and capture and reuse of stormwater runoff have been used to the maximum extent practical and that no additional runoff reduction can be provided on the site. Any of the prescribed runoff reduction volume that is not captured and retained, reused, or otherwise reduced on the site, shall be captured and treated in an appropriate structural stormwater management practice that has been selected, designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the standards, criteria, and information presented in the latest edition of the Coastal Stormwater Supplement.
