Notwithstanding the foregoing definitions, any planned special event to be held in any part of the beach is presumed to be a special event, except for specifically enumerated exceptions that are a part of this article. This presumption can be rebutted only by the event producer providing clear and convincing evidence that, based upon the nature, location, time and season of the event there is a high degree of probability that the event will not draw a crowd in excess of one person for every seven square feet of beach controlled by the producer, or where people are gathered for purposes of the event.

Such term shall be synonymous with "promoter" and includes a person or entity who directly or indirectly encourages, persuades, or advertises, or uses publicity to encourage or persuade attendance at an event or gathering, whether or not for personal pecuniary gain.
Special event shall mean any assembly of persons upon the public beaches, public streets or rights of way, or within the city parks or parking lots, where it is either reasonably anticipated that municipal services will be required, or where additional municipal services are actually required. All special events require a permit under this article whether a planned event or an unplanned/pop up special event.

(2)
The event promoter stands willing and able to pay and deposits a sum of money to cover any overtime for city staff to conduct an ordinary review of the application, and staff volunteers such overtime, then the city will use reasonable efforts to process a tardy application in time to allow the event to be held.

(Ord. No. 2017-04-A , § 1, 3-23-2017; Ord. No. 2021-13 , § I(Att.), 4-22-2021)
Sec. 54-72. - Community festival, festival area and control zone.
(a)
Designation of a community festival. On the recommendation of the city manager, the mayor and council may designate and name certain community festival days and, during such festival days, authorize cultural and entertainment events and initiate regulatory provisions of this article within the festival area.
(b)

(4)
Identification, consumption of alcoholic beverages. Require wristbands or other means of identifying persons who have displayed proof of attaining the age of 21 years and who are authorized to purchase or hold in possession alcoholic beverages within the control zone, outside of licensed alcohol beverage establishments. A fee, as set by the mayor and council, may be charged for such wristbands and such wristbands shall contain the city logo. Only persons who are authorized may sell or disburse wristbands. Displaying such a wristband does not relieve alcohol beverage establishments of responsibility for determining if a person has attained the age of 21 years before dispensing alcohol to that person.
(5)
Designation of festival manager within the control zone. The mayor and council may designate and authorize a non-profit, tax exempt organization or similar entity to organize and manage festival activities within a control zone. Such designation may include authorization to collect and expend funds, in which case paragraph (6) below will apply.
(6)
Financial requirements, audit regarding wristbands. Any organization designated and authorized to collect fees and generate revenues from the public in connection with such event shall, with regard to sales of wristbands, within seven calendar days of conclusion of the event, provide to the city manager a comprehensive audit that provides full accounting of all revenues and expenditures associated with the event. The designated organization shall be required to maintain documentation supporting event revenues and expenditures. The city will have complete and free access to all such financial records at all reasonable times for purposes of review and audit. Any organization designated and authorized to collect fees and generate revenues from the sales of wristbands to the public in connection with such event shall, within seven calendar days of conclusion of the event, provide the city manager with a certified report of the number of wristbands sold and pay the city the agreed upon fee for each wristband sold (or otherwise unaccounted for).
(7)
Insurance. Any organization authorized to organize and manage festival activities within a control zone shall take out and keep in force for all activities associated with such event a special events liability policy. Such policy shall provide the following:

Restricting hours of alcohol sales. Within the control zone, outdoor dispensing of alcoholic beverages under any permit or license will be promoted from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight only.
(Ord. No. 2017-04-A , § 1, 3-23-2017)
Sec. 54-73. - Application and plan.
(a)
Each plan included in the special event application, and any conditions imposed by the city manager pursuant to section 54-76(e), shall be continuously implemented during the special event, and any failure to do so shall result in the automatic suspension of the permit and suspension of the event until full implementation is made.
(1)
Should the actual attendance at any special event, including persons attempting to enter the event, or the municipal services actually required at a permitted event exceed for a period of one hour the number or level anticipated by the application and permit, it shall become the duty of all persons owning or able to control the event or the event venue to take reasonable, diligent, and constant measures to reduce the excess until the planned number or level is reasonably achieved. The failure of any such person to immediately, after notice from the city, make a reasonable, diligent and constant effort to reduce the excess shall be a violation of this law punishable by civil penalties specified in this article. The chief of police or his designee is authorized to approve actions to partially or slowly reduce the excess as compliance if he or she finds (i) that such person is acting in good faith after notice of the excess, (ii) that full and immediate elimination of the excess will not be feasible and (iii) that it would be safer to taper down the event rather than to abruptly close the venue or stop the event.
(2)
Conversely, should actual attendance fall below the permit estimates for a sustained period and appear likely to continue at reduced levels, the city manager or his designee shall be authorized, but not required, to allow the applicant to reduce staffing to the minimums reasonably required.
(Ord. No. 2017-04-A , § 1, 3-23-2017)
Sec. 54-74. - Unpermitted assembly (pop-up events).
The city has found and determined that some special events occur without a permit, especially if attendance is promoted through instantaneous, social media.
(a)
If an assembly develops into a special event (without a permit) it shall become the duty of all persons or entities owning or able to control the special event or who are providing entertainment encouraging the assembly, to take reasonable, diligent and constant measures to reduce the activity or circumstances which caused the assembly to become a special event—that is for example but not limited to, reducing the number of attendees, or to provide the additional municipal type services needed to regulate event traffic, maintain the peace and protect the public health and safety. The failure of any such person or entity to immediately after notice from the city make a reasonable, diligent and constant effort to reduce the event attendance or otherwise provide adequate services, to the satisfaction of the chief of police or his/her designee shall be a violation of this law punishable by civil penalties specified in this article. The chief of police or his designee is authorized to approve actions to partially or slowly reduce the event attendance to a point where it is not considered a special event if he or she finds:
(1)
That such person is acting expeditiously and reasonably to employ feasibly available resources to address the issues after notice that the assembly has become a special event;
(2)
That full reduction to the criteria threshold will not be feasible; and
(3)
That it would be safer to taper down the event rather than to abruptly close the venue or stop the event.
(b)
Whether a spontaneous assembly has developed into a special event based upon attendance or a need for municipal services (as those services are defined in this article), shall be determined by an objective and reasonable examination of the totality of the circumstances at hand, including but not limited to the following factors:
(1)
With respect to attendance and attempted attendance:
a.
Whether the attendance is ticketed.
b.
Actual attendance at prior, similar events.
c.
The extent of commercial promotion and advertisement of the event, especially promotion outside of the city, by traditional or digital means, but excluding spontaneous social media not initiated, encouraged or orchestrated by a commercial event producer or any person acting on behalf of the event producer or any person with a financial or other personal interest in the event ("spontaneous social media").
d.
The extent of spontaneous social media encouraging attendance at the assembly.
e.
Whether the location and configuration the assembly, and the nature and presence (sight and sound) of the event, will be likely to draw attendees or observers from the public at large.
f.
The number in attendance and attempting to attend shall be determined by the chief of police or his designee using recognized or previously established law enforcement estimating techniques.
(2)
With respect to municipal services actually required:
a.
Repeated pedestrian trespass.
b.
Repeated vehicular trespass.
c.
Illegal parking.
d.
Traffic congestion.
e.
Apparent need for sanitation facilities as evidenced by public urination or other bodily functions.

g.
Repeated noise ordinance violations after notice, including differing offenders.
h.
Unusual amount of trash being abandoned with no apparent resources available to clean up after event.
i.
Unusual or repeated need for medical assistance.
(c)
When the city is aware of the planning of an assembly in which the chief of police determines is more likely than not to become a special event, as defined by this article, then the city manager may notify anyone promoting, organizing, or otherwise planning to attend that they may be subject to this article and all resulting criminal and civil penalties. Said communication shall also include a copy of a special event application and a copy of this article.
(d)
In addition to the procedures described above, the mayor and council of the city may by resolution impose restrictions on activities including, but not limited to, the public consumption of alcoholic beverages in areas designated in such resolution upon a report to the mayor and council that an unpermitted event is being promoted and advertised, published on social media, or by leaflets or by other means where such promotion reasonably indicates to the mayor and council that there is an immediate risk to the public safety, welfare, citizens and property of those participating in the event and residents of the city. Upon the passage of any such resolution pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the resolution shall be posted on the city's website and publication and dissemination thereof shall be encouraged and notice thereof shall be disseminated to the fullest extent possible so as to alert the public, the event producers or promoters and all persons whatsoever of the lack of permission for the event and/or a prohibition on the public consumption of alcoholic beverages during such dates, times and locations as set forth in the resolution.
(Ord. No. 2017-04-A , § 1, 3-23-2017; Ord. No. 2021-13 , § I(Att.), 4-22-2021)
Sec. 54-75. - Fees.
(a)
As part of the application review process, together with the services requested by the applicant, the city manager shall set fees to defray the costs of city services for special events to be determined on the basis of actual expected costs. The costs shall be the marginal costs directly associated with the special event above what the general public would generally require. Such fees may be adjusted to the extent that the city co-sponsors a special event, as determined by the city manager. In the instance of a spontaneous unpermitted special event, where the city incurs marginal costs directly associated with the unpermitted special event, the fee shall still be calculated and applicable as further provided herein.
(b)
The level of municipal services required shall be determined by an objective, reasonable examination of the totality of the circumstances, including but not limited to the following factors:
(1)
The size of the assembly and the anticipated attendance.
(2)
The location of the event to determine the potential for pedestrian and vehicular congestion.
(3)
The nature of the event, the activities planned during it and the weather conditions of the season to evaluate the danger of harm to persons and property such as a fireworks explosion, a collision of participants or spectators, spectator or participant heatstroke, drowning, and the like.
(4)
The historical density of visitors to the city during the annual season of the event and the type of activities, safe and unsafe, in which those visitors have historically engaged.
(5)
Whether the assembly is specifically designed and staffed to handle the anticipated needs and effects of the anticipated number of attendees.
(c)
The city shall notify the applicant of the municipal services fee, and if requested grant a meeting with the city manager to confer with the applicant about the fee. If the applicant does not accept the type and extent of municipal services listed and the amount of the municipal services fee, the city shall nonetheless proceed in ordinary course to complete the application process and either deny the permit through the process contained in this article without consideration of the applicant's objection to the fee, or if the applicant is entitled to the permit then grant the permit upon the condition that the municipal services fee be paid before the permit becomes valid or effective. The applicant shall have the right to appeal to the mayor and council the type and extent of services required and the amount of the fee by letter filed with the city clerk within three business days after the city shall provide the applicant the itemization and amount of the fee which notice shall state that the applicant may appeal within three business days. The mayor and council shall uphold or lessen the fee based upon information about the extent of services to be rendered by the city directly related to the event and the cost of those services as presented by the city manager or his/her designee and the applicant in a de novo, quasi-judicial hearing held as soon as may be practicable. The mayor and council's decision, including its reasons therefore, shall be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and entered onto the record thereof which shall constitute the council's final order in any subsequent proceedings. The hearing may be continued from time to time in the sole discretion of the mayor and council. If the mayor and council is unable to timely conduct or conclude the hearing in time for the event to be held pursuant to an otherwise valid permit, the applicant may pay to the city the disputed fee under protest, and the permit shall become effective so that the event may be held, in which case the hearing shall be held and concluded after the event at a mutually convenient time. If the fee is upheld, it shall be accepted by the city; if it is reduced the reduction shall be refunded to the applicant.
(d)
In the event of an unplanned and unpermitted special event, anyone who promoted, planned, executed, and/or provided entertainment shall be responsible for the applicable municipal services fee. This includes anyone that promotes through social media. The city manager is authorized to direct the city attorney to pursue all legal remedies necessary to collect any fees that are authorized pursuant to this article.
(Ord. No. 2017-04-A , § 1, 3-23-2017)
Sec. 54-76. - Action on the application and appeal.
(a)
The city manager must decide to grant or deny an application at the earliest possible time after receipt.
(b)
The city manager may deny a permit only on one or more of the following grounds:

(2)
The application fee has not been paid;
(3)
The proposed event is unlawful;
(4)
The application contains a material falsehood or misrepresentation;

The proposed event is of such a nature or duration that it cannot be reasonably accommodated in the particular location; or
(7)
The applicant has refused to attend or participate in good faith in a pre-permit meeting requested by the city manager following reasonable notice and scheduling attempts by the city manager and failed to propose reasonable alternatives.
(c)
The city manager is expressly prohibited from denying any permit based upon the identity of any speaker or entertainer or the viewpoint, content, or type of speech or expression to be displayed so long as such speech or expression is lawful.
(d)
Every denial of a permit shall be in writing and shall clearly explain the reason(s) for denial. A denial of a permit application as "incomplete" must identify the specific information required by this article which was not provided. A denial based upon the unlawfulness of an event must identify the law or regulation prohibiting such conduct. A denial based upon a clear and present danger to the public safety or health must identify the specific conditions which reasonably give rise to the danger. A denial based upon the fact that the proposed event cannot be reasonably accommodated in the particular location applied for must state specific reasons why the area is unsuitable for the event. A denial based upon an applicant's refusal to attend or participate in good faith in a pre-permit meeting, or suggest an alternative, shall identify the steps taken to provide reasonable notice and scheduling of such meeting and, if applicable, any conduct at the meeting demonstrating bad faith participation by the applicant. The purpose of the requirement is to allow the applicant to know the grounds upon which the permit was denied and to permit mayor and council the opportunity to verify and confirm the objective validity of any denial and to ensure that any limited discretion given to the city manager under this article is not abused so as to disfavor protected speech or expression.
(e)
The city manager may condition any permit with reasonable requirements concerning the time, place or manner of holding a special event as is necessary to coordinate municipal services, multiple uses of public property, assure preservation of public property and public places, prevent dangerous, unlawful or impermissible uses, protect the safety of persons and property and to control vehicular and pedestrian traffic in and around the venue, provided that such requirements are narrowly tailored to address these concerns and are not implemented for the purpose of regulating or restricting protected speech or expressive conduct.
All permit applications shall be deemed granted as applied for if the city manager does not grant, grant with conditions, or deny the permit in writing within 30 calendar days of receiving an application. A permit which is granted automatically under this section is conditioned upon any required city services fee being paid before the permit becomes valid or effective. If an applicant disagrees with the fee required, the provisions of section 54-75(c) shall control. The automatic granting of permits provided in this section shall not apply if:
(1)
The permit application fee has not been paid;
(2)
The city manager has indicated his intent to deny a permit and the applicant has agreed, in writing, to supply the city manager with additional information which may allow the permit to be granted. In this case, the permit application will be deemed granted if the city manager does not grant, grant with conditions, or deny the permit in writing within ten calendar days of receipt of the additional information, unless the applicant agrees in writing to provide further additional information, which shall renew the terms and timeframes of this paragraph; or
(3)
The city manager requests additional time to review the application and the request is agreed to in writing by the applicant. In this case, the permit application will be deemed granted if the city manager does not grant, grant with conditions, or deny the permit in writing by the expiration of the agreed date.
(f)
Every denial of a permit and every conditional grant of a permit challenged by an applicant is appealable to the mayor and council by letter filed with the city clerk within three business days after receipt of the denial or proposed conditional grant. The mayor and council shall grant or deny the permit, or uphold or rescind the conditions, based upon information presented by the applicant and the city manager or his designee in a de novo, quasi-judicial hearing held as soon as practicable. The mayor and council's decision, including its reasons therefor, shall be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and entered onto the record thereof which shall constitute the mayor and council's final order in any subsequent proceedings and which may, but shall not be required to, express findings of fact and conclusions of law. The hearing may be continued from time to time in the sole discretion of the mayor and council, provided that if the mayor and council does not render a final order within 15 days after filing of the letter of appeal the permit shall be deemed granted.

Sec. 54-79. - Weather and other changes.
Once a special event has been permitted, location and date changes necessitated by weather events or other calamity shall not require further permitting, and all authorizations and licenses or permissions applicable to the original permit shall continue to the extent applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the permit holder must cooperatively work with staff on different dates, locations and times.
The city manager shall have the authority to revoke a permit in the event that weather or other environmental conditions presents a substantial likelihood of danger to the public, and event organizers and attendees.

Should any section, provision, or clause of any part of this article be declared invalid or unconstitutional, or if the provisions of any part of this article as applied to any particular situation or set of circumstances be declared invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity shall not be construed to affect portions of this article not so held to be invalid, or the application of this article to other circumstances not so held to be invalid. It is hereby declared as the intent of the city that this article would have been adopted had any such invalid portion not been included herein.

The following criteria shall be used in establishing fees for the use of public facilities.
(1)
Fees are applicable whenever all or a portion of public facilities are reserved for exclusive use, or whenever a special event would result in the city experiencing special expenditures.
(2)
Fees applicable for commercial events may not be waived in whole or in part, since such waiver would be a transfer of public funds to a private entity without a corresponding direct benefit to the city.
(3)
Special events having indirect effects on government revenues and expenditures, such as increasing business activity or future tourism, may not be granted a fee waiver on the basis of such indirect effects, since such waiver would be an indirect transfer of public funds to a private entity without a corresponding direct benefit to the city.
(4)
Noncommercial special events for resident and business taxpayers may have partial fee waivers since a portion of the government's expenditures may have been prepaid through taxes, etc.
(5)
The city may co-sponsor special events whenever such events are deemed to serve the general public welfare (and not the welfare of organizations or selected individuals).
(6)
Special event fees must be determined on the basis of estimated governmental expenditures associated with the event, and may include recovery of capital expenditures, operating costs, and maintenance costs.
