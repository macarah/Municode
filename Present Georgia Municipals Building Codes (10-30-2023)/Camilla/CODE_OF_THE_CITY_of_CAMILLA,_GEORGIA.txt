PREFACE
As adopted in 1980, this Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Camilla of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. Subsequently, the Code was republished in 1999, and included ordinances through Ordinance No. 98-22, enacted December 14, 1998.
Source materials used in the preparation of the republication were the 1980 City of Camilla Code, as supplemented through December 22, 1980 and ordinances subsequently adopted by the council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to correlative Charter provisions and relevant state laws have been included.
Numbering System
The numbering system used in this republication is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the ninth section of chapter 2 is 2-9. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-2 and 4-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-2.1, 4-2.2, 4-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.1. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of each chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division.
Index
The general index of the republication has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance.
Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
The republication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Janet Cramer and Amy Zukeran of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout both the recodification and the republication projects.
The publishers are most grateful to the Ms. Kathy N. Baker, City Clerk, and other members of the city government, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on the republication process. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

ADOPTING ORDINANCE
ORDINANCE NO. 80-13
An Ordinance of the City of Camilla, Georgia, Adopting and Enacting a New Code for Camilla, Georgia; Establishing the Same; Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances Not Included Therein, Except as Herein Expressly Provided; Providing for the Manner of Amending Such Code; Providing When this Ordinance Shall Become Effective; Providing Certain Penalties; and for Other Purposes.
Be it Ordained by the Mayor and Council of the City of Camilla, Georgia, and it is hereby ordained by authority of the same as follows:
Section 1.  The document entitled "Code of the City of Camilla, Georgia," a copy of which accompanies this ordinance and is incorporated herein and made a part hereof, is hereby adopted and shall be treated and considered as a new and original comprehensive ordinance.
Section 2.  All ordinances and resolutions of a general and permanent nature of this city enacted on final passage on or before October 27, 1980, and not in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein are hereby repealed from and after the effective date of this ordinance, except as hereinafter provided.
Section 3.  The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not affect any offense or act committed or done or any penalty or forfeiture incurred or any contract or right established or accruing before the effective date of this ordinance; nor shall this repeal affect any ordinance or resolution of the city promising or guaranteeing the payment of money by or to the city, or authorizing the issuance of any bonds of the city, or any evidence of the city's indebtedness, or any contract or obligation assumed by the city; nor shall this repeal affect any rights or franchise granted by any ordinance or resolution of the city to any person, firm or corporation; nor shall this repeal affect any ordinance or resolution dedicating, naming, establishing, locating, relocating, opening, paving, widening, vacating, etc., any street or public way in the city; nor shall this repeal affect the present annual appropriation of the city; nor shall this repeal affect any ordinance or resolution levying or imposing charges, fees or taxes now due or accrued; nor shall this repeal affect any zoning ordinance or map, or changes thereto; nor shall this repeal be construed to revive any ordinance or resolution or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance or resolution which is repealed by this ordinance.
Section 4.  The provisions appearing in this Code, so far as they are the same as provisions of ordinances and resolutions existing at the time of the effective date of this Code, are intended, and shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments.
Section 5.  Any and all additions or amendments to the Code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the city council to make the same a part thereof, shall be deemed to be incorporated into the Code so that reference to the "Code of the City of Camilla, Georgia," shall be understood and intended to include such additions and amendments.
Section 6.  A copy of the Code shall be kept on file in the office of the city clerk, and preserved in looseleaf form, or in such other form as the city clerk may consider most expedient. It shall be the express duty of the city clerk or someone authorized by the city clerk, to insert in their designated places all amendments, ordinances or resolutions which indicate the intention of the city governing authority to make those provisions a part of the Code, when those provisions have been reprinted in page form, and to extract from the Code all provisions which may be from time to time repealed. A copy of the Code shall be available for all persons desiring to examine it and shall be considered the official Code of the city.
Section 7.  As pages of the Code are replaced because the matter contained on them shall have been repealed, amended, or otherwise shall have been superseded or rendered obsolete or inoperative, the city clerk shall retain copies of the pages of the Code so superseded, rendered obsolete or otherwise rendered inoperative in a file so that the former provisions of the Code may be readily available and easily found. The purpose of this section is to permit anyone desiring to do so to ascertain the precise status of any section of the Code as of any given date.
Section 8.  In case of the amendment of any section of the Code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in the City Charter or the Code shall apply to the section as amended; or in case such amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the aforementioned general penalty, is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so provided in such other section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein.
Section 9.  It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of the Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with the Code in any manner whatsoever which may cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby.
Section 10.  All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are, to the extent of such conflict, hereby repealed.
Section 11.  This ordinance shall be in force and take effect on January 1, 1981.
Adopted this 22nd day of December, 1980.
