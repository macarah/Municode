--- (4) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2013-04-08-1, §§ 2-326—2-334, adopted April 8, 2013, added provisions to the Code, but did not specify manner of inclusion. Therefore, at the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been included as §§ 2-8-1—2-8-9 herein.

Sec. 2-8-1. - Intent and purpose.
It is essential to the proper administration and operation of the city that all elected or appointed city officials be, and give the appearance of being, independent and impartial; that public office not be used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the governing authority. The governing authority finds that the public interest requires that they protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the members of the governing authority in situations where a conflict may exist
The purpose of this code of ethics is to:
(1)
Encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials;
(2)
Establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the interest of the city;
(3)
Require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in matters affecting the city; and,
(4)
Serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms.
The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to all elected or appointed city officials.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, state law and the charter of the city shall be controlling in the event of an actual conflict with the provisions of this code of ethics. This chapter shall be interpreted to supplement, and not replace, said provisions of state law and the charter.
(Ord. No. 2013-04-08-1, § 2-326, 4-8-13)
Sec. 2-8-2. - Definitions.
Solely for the purpose of this chapter, the term:
City official or official , unless otherwise expressly defined does not include city employees but does mean the mayor, members of the city council, municipal court judges (including substitute judges), city manager, city clerk, city attorney, and all other persons holding positions designated by the city charter, as amended. The term "city official" also includes all individuals, including city employees, appointed by the mayor and/or city council as appropriate to city authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can or may vote or take formal action or make official recommendations to the mayor and/or city council.
Complaint means a written sworn statement filed with the city clerk containing specific allegations of misconduct by a member; provided, however, such allegations must be filed within six months of discovery of the alleged misconduct.
Decision means any ordinance, resolution, contract, franchise, formal action or other matter voted on by the city council or other city board or commission, as well as the discussions or deliberations of the council, board, or commission which can or may lead to a vote or formal action by that body.
