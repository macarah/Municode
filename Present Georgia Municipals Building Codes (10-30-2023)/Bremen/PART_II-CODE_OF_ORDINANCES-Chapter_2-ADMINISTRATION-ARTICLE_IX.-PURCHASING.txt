Sec. 2-478. - Competitive sealed proposals.
(a)
When the purchasing agent determines, in writing, that the use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal. Use of the proposal is dependent upon such factors as:
(1)
When the quality, availability, or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or services;
(2)
When the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the city's best interest;
(3)
If a fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous; or
(4)
Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternative proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award.
(b)
Procedure.
(1)
Proposals shall be requested by advertisement in a newspaper having general circulation in the city. The advertisement shall state the time and place where specifications may be obtained, and the time and place for deadline for receipt of the proposals, unless otherwise directed by the city council.

The multistep competitive sealed procurement method may be used when the city desires to award a contract not necessarily based on price, and when specifications may not be readily available or when technical qualifications are essential for the decision making process. This type shall take the form of request for proposals or request for information and shall follow the following format. If time is of the essence, the two steps can be combined with the priced offer submitted in a separate sealed envelope at the time of submission of the technical offer.

(2)

A team consisting of not less than three persons shall evaluate the results of this solicitation. This team shall include the purchasing agent, the head of the user department, and an additional representative of the user department selected by the respective department head. Evaluation shall follow the same criteria as under request for proposals.
(3)
In the second step, those who submitted technical offers deemed responsible and responsive in the initial step are then asked to submit price bids.
(4)
Proposals shall be sealed. All proposals shall be publicly opened and the purchasing agent shall make or oversee the making of a record of the proposals received. The record and the proposals received shall be subject to public inspection after the proposal opening in the manner prescribed by law.
(5)
Award of proposal shall be made to the bidder that submits the lowest responsible and responsive proposal that meets the specifications contained in the proposal documents and is in the city's best interest. The city reserves the right to make award if a single proposal is received.
(6)
If required by the soliciting documents, the purchasing agent may require the successful contracting party to furnish a payment and performance bond to secure the faithful performance of all of the terms of the contract. The payment and performance bond shall be in a form approved by the city attorney and the form of the bond shall be included in the specifications.
(7)
