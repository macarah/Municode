(Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.14.20(3))
Sec. 100-10. - Hearings on zoning decisions; notice.
(a)
The planning and zoning commission review shall consist of two hearings which shall be noticed pursuant to the notice requirements provided in O.C.G.A. § 36-66-4.
(1)
The first hearing is to officially recognize the proposed amendment and place said amendment on the agenda and is known as a first reading. At the first reading of the application discussion of the application may be held by the planning and zoning commission, and the planning and zoning commission may instruct the zoning enforcement officer to request additional information of the applicant for consideration at the public hearing on the application; however, no vote on the application or the merits thereof shall be held or taken during this initial reading.
(2)
The second hearing, known as a second reading, shall be a public hearing following published notice, at which hearing the planning and zoning commission will review and discuss the application and have the opportunity to take and receive information from the applicant and others speaking on behalf of the application and take comments from those in the general public who desire to speak in opposition to the amendment proposed by the application. The applicant is encouraged to meet with the owners of properties lying adjacent to the property in question that may be directly affected by the proposed amendment change and also with others expressing an opposition to the proposed amendment in an effort to clarify its application, to resolve misunderstandings and differences prior to the public hearing; however, such a meeting is not mandatory.
(b)
An application for rezoning may be withdrawn by the applicant, without penalty, so long as a written request to withdraw the application is received by the codes enforcement officer, or the planning and zoning commission, prior to the start of the planning and zoning commission's public hearing on the application. During the initial public hearing before the planning and zoning commission, the applicant may request that the issue presented in the application be tabled until a date certain for the obtaining and submission of additional information to the commission for its consideration prior to the commission making its decision to recommend approval or denial of the application. Subsequent to the completion of the hearing on the application by the planning and zoning commission, the application may be withdrawn by written request of the applicant delivered to the codes enforcement officer not less than 24 hours prior to the public hearing on the application by the mayor and city council; however, the applicant shall not be allowed to resubmit its application for consideration for an amendment to the land development code (to the same zoning classification as previous submitted) for a period of 90 days after the date of the withdrawal. Any request by the applicant to withdraw its application within the 24 hours prior to the public hearing by the mayor and city council and before the zoning decision on the application is made by the council shall be solely in the discretion of the mayor and council.
(c)
Within its allotted review period, the planning and zoning commission shall submit a recommendation to the mayor and city council that recommends an approval or a denial of the rezoning application. Before the mayor and city council render its decision to accept or reject a rezoning application, it shall hold a public hearing on the issue presented by the application. At the public hearing the mayor and city council shall receive and consider the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, but the council is in no way bound to follow the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission. The mayor and city council shall take a vote on the application for rezoning upon the completion of the public hearing, to either:
(1)
Approve the application;
(2)
Deny the application; or
(3)
Accept the application subject to stipulations.
The mayor and city council may vote to table the zoning decision until a date certain, but only with the consent of the applicant. The applicant may demand a vote on a decision either for or against the application at the hearing.
(d)
Posting notice of rezoning petition.
(1)
At least 15 days prior to the second reading before the planning and zoning commission, signs shall be posted on the property notifying interested persons that a rezoning petition has been filed. Failure to post or maintain the notice shall not, however, invalidate the actions taken.
(2)
Zoning decisions initiated by the planning and zoning commission or the mayor and city council shall require a public hearing on the proposed action; notice of said hearing to be published in the legal organ of either Haralson County or Carroll County (depending upon the situs of the property in question) at minimum of 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing. The notice shall state the time, place, and purpose of the hearing.
(3)
In addition, notice that an application for amendment to rezone a tract of property shall be given by first-class mail to all readily identifiable property owners holding recorded title to adjacent properties at the addresses for said adjacent property owners as shown on the tax records of the respective county wherein the property is situated. Said notice shall be deemed sufficient when deposited in the U.S. Post Office.
(4)
A sign shall be posted on the property. Said sign shall be placed within ten feet of the right-of-way upon which the property fronts and shall be plainly visible from said roadway. In the event the property fronts both sides of a public road, a sign shall be placed on both sides of said roadway. Where the property borders more than one public right-of-way, a sign shall be posted on all contiguous rights-of-way.
(5)
Where property does not front on an existing public right-of-way, the sign shall be placed on the right-of-way of the public road (which in the estimation of the codes enforcement officer) is closest to the subject property. The sign shall, in addition to the information set out in subsection (6) of this section, include a reference to the present map and parcel number of the property.
(6)
The sign shall include the following:
a.
Notice of rezoning hearing;
b.
Date, time, and location of hearing;
c.
Present zoning;
d.
New zoning proposed by the application;
e.
Property map;
f.
Name of applicant;
g.
Name and telephone number of a city official or staff member from whom additional information may be obtained.
(e)
The following procedures shall apply to all amendment hearings:
(1)
At all hearings a quorum of the planning and zoning commission or mayor and city councilmembers shall be present.
(2)
All hearings shall be open to the public.
(3)
At any hearing the analysis submitted by the initiating party, if any, shall be reviewed, along with the record prepared by the planning and zoning commission. The review of such analysis and records at such hearing or meeting shall consist, as a minimum, of a statement of the finding with respect to each matter enumerated in subsection (f) of this section, or the written presentation of such finding to the members of the mayor and city council together with a limited supply of copies of such finding to be available at the hearing or meeting and available on request to interested members of the public.
(4)
The procedures for conducting public zoning hearings as adopted by the city council shall apply for all public hearings to include hearings before boards and commissions of the city.
(5)
All decisions shall be by a majority vote.
(6)
Transcripts, if desired, shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
(f)
The planning and zoning commission in making its review, investigations, and recommendations, and the mayor and city council in rendering its zoning decision shall, at all times, endeavor to reach decisions which balance the interest of promoting the public health, safety, morality, and general welfare of the city against the constitutionally protected rights of the property owner to the unrestricted use of his property. The planning and zoning commission shall investigate and make a recommendation with respect to certain required matters. The planning and zoning commission shall make a written record of its investigation and recommendations, and this record shall be a public record. The planning and zoning commission shall address each of the enumerated matters set out below and make a recommendation with respect to each of said matters. The matters with which the planning and zoning commission shall be required to make such investigation and recommendation shall be:
(1)
Compatibility with adjacent uses and districts. Existing uses and use districts of surrounding and nearby properties, and whether the proposed use district is suitable in light of such existing uses and use districts of surrounding and nearby properties, and whether the proposal will materially and adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby properties.
(2)
Property value. The existing value of the property contained in the petition under the existing use district classification, the extent to which the property value of the subject property is diminished by the existing use district classification, and whether the subject property has a viable and reasonable economic use under the current use district.
(3)
Suitability. The suitability of the subject property under the existing use district classification, and the suitability of the subject property under the proposed use district classification of the property.
(4)
Vacancy and marketing. The length of time the property has been vacant or unused as currently used under the current use district classification; and any efforts taken by the property owner to use the property or sell the property under the existing use district classification.
(5)
Evidence of need. The amount of undeveloped land in the general area affected which has the same use district classification as the map change requested. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that the proposed application promotes public health, safety, morality or general welfare.
(6)
Public facilities impacts. Whether the proposal will result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, schools, parks, or other public facilities and services.
(7)
Consistency with comprehensive plan. Whether the proposal is in conformity with the policy and intent of the locally adopted comprehensive plan.
(8)
Other conditions. Whether there are any other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the proposal.
(g)
In addition to the review criteria listed above, the following review criteria shall be utilized in the review of rezoning applications for two-family developments (duplexes), townhouse developments, and multi-family developments (apartments) in excess of 12 units:
(1)
Rezoning for two-family, townhouse, and multi-family uses should not be permitted on parcels that are surrounded on more than two sides by property that is either used for single-family residential uses or zoned R-12, R-40, or R-20.
(2)
The parcel shall have primary ingress and egress from a major collector street.
(3)
The parcel should be served with public water and sewer.
(4)
The rezoning of parcel should not require more than two steps up in district intensity compared to its current zoning district.
(5)
Rezoning for two-family, townhouse, and multi-family uses should be evaluated in the context of the comparatively greater impacts of multi-family housing on city services when considered as a land development pattern; and the city's policy to limit the amount of multi-family housing to the proportion that currently exists, approximately 50 percent of the total housing stock.
(Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.14.20(4)—(10))
Sec. 100-11. - Reconsideration by mayor and city council.
No application for rezoning property within the city to the same zoning classification previously requested shall be considered if the area requested to be rezoned to the zoning classification sought, has been considered and denied by the mayor and city council within a period of 12 months immediately preceding the application.
(Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.14.60)
Sec. 100-12. - Review of zoning decision.
Recourse from a zoning decision by the mayor and city council shall be to board of development appeals.

(Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.12.50)
Sec. 100-15. - Penalties for violation.
Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be subject to the fines and penalties provided in chapter 1 of the Code; however, prosecution under the provisions of chapter 1 does not limit the city's right or ability to seek other remedies and take other legal or equitable actions that may be necessary to protect the public. Each day that said violation continues after the date of the service of the citation of violation shall constitute a separate prosecutable offense.
Sec. 100-16. - Variance requests.
When special conditions are present such that it is shown that a literal enforcement of the provisions of this land development code will result in an unnecessary hardship, a variance of the literal enforcement of the rules may be granted if the spirit of the regulation can be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon finding by the board of development appeals that relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of the regulation, and the presence of at least one of the additional conditions set out as follow:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography;
(2)
The application of the subdivision regulation to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship;

Sec. 100-18. - Appeal shall stay other proceedings.
An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the city certifies to the board after the notice of appeal shall have been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the city's opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the superior court of the county in which the property at issue is located.
(Ord. No. 2016-O-005, § 2.10.5, 7-18-2016)
Sec. 100-19. - Appeals from decision of board of development appeals.

Whenever any amendment for amending or altering this land development code is accompanied or supported by specific plans and design for a particular development and use, and the mayor and city council, after public hearing as provided herein, approve such specific plans and design and land development code is amended accordingly, said amendment may be qualified as "conditional" under that category and the codes enforcement officer shall issue a building permit for the development of said property only in strict compliance with the plan submitted.
(2)
Plans supporting the approval and procedure outlined in subsection (1) of this section shall be submitted in triplicate. Upon approval by the mayor and city council said plans shall bear a certificate by the city clerk indicating said approval with the stipulated conditions. One copy of said plan shall be maintained by the city clerk as a part of the record of rezoning, one copy filed with the zoning enforcement officer and one copy returned to the applicant.
(3)
If for any reason, development and use of the property approved in accordance with the procedure outlined in subsections (1) and (2) of this section cannot be accomplished, such plans shall not be altered, changed or varied, except after approval by the mayor and city council.
(4)
If no building permit or certificate of occupancy, based upon approved plan and amendment, is issued within 12 months from the date of approval of any such "conditional" rezoning, the mayor and city council may, on its own motion, cause the property to revert to its original zoning category after notice by U. S. Mail addressed to the original applicant for rezoning or to such other person as may be substituted for said original applicant and the filing of the same upon the records of the clerk, and reasonable opportunity to said applicant to oppose the reversion to the original zoning category has been given.
(5)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary which might appear in this land development code, the mayor and council shall have all powers to approve and to enforce conditional zoning not otherwise prohibited by state and federal law.
