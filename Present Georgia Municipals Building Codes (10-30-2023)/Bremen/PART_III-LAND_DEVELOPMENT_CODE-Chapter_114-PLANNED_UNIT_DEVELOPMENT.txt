Chapter 114 - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 114-1. - Planned unit developments.
(a)
Purpose of planned unit developments.
(1)
The purpose of planned unit developments (PUDs) is to encourage the best possible site plans and building arrangements under a unified plan of development rather than under a lot-by-lot regulation. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities and the flexibility in design. The city gains the advantages of a variety of building types, compatibility of uses and optimum community development. Review of the development plans by the planning and zoning commission and formal approval by the mayor and city council provides an opportunity to assure that the development will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood in which the development is located.
(2)
The planned unit development is not intended to encourage greater density of development but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning. Furthermore, the planned unit development is not intended to enhance the value of property for speculative purposes. Approval of a planned unit development is therefore conditional, and if construction is not commenced within one year, and/or pursued in an orderly manner toward completion, the mayor and city council may, upon written notice to the property owner, abolish the zoning or reduce the size of the tract to fit the scope of actual development. All planned unit developments will be approved as a conditional use based upon detailed plans submitted. No changes to the approved plan may be made without review by the planning commission and approval by the mayor and city council.
(b)
Ownership control. All of the land in a planned unit development shall be owned initially by an individual, corporation or by some legal entity. Individual properties in a planned unit development may be sold after a plat has been recorded with the properties subject to private deed covenants that assure the continuance of the planned unit development as originally approved and developed.
(Code 1996, § 82-86(a), (c); Ord. of 3-8-1999, pt. II, art. 10)
Sec. 114-2. - Administrative/approval process.
(a)
Approval required. All requests for a planned unit development shall be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission and approved by the mayor and city council as a conditional development requiring a zoning decision. This will require that the application be received and processED with the same formality as to notice, posting and hearing as a rezoning application.
(b)
Required standards of submitted documents. All plats, plans, reports, etc., submitted must meet all of the requirements of the subdivision regulations; design and construction standards; land use requirements; and other development standards as set forth in the land development code, as may be amended or varied, with approval of the mayor and city council as provided for in this chapter, pursuant to the requirements outlined in this chapter and in order to accomplish the purpose and intent of this chapter.
(c)
Additional requirements for proposed PUD developments. In addition to any plans required by the land development code, developers of PUD developments must also submit the following plans, showing any required improvements for the PUD development in its entirety:
(1)
Preliminary PUD site plan showing the requested PUD in its entirety including all districts and the requested zoning of each district;
(2)
Provision of infrastructure plan including streets, water, sewer, etc., that might be expected to be reasonably impacted by this development;
(3)
Pedestrian/bicycle access plan;
(4)
Parking plan;
(5)
Open space and vegetation preservation plan;
(6)
Landscaping plan;
(7)
Street lighting plan;
(8)
Phased construction plan including the statement of expiration of PUD approval.
(d)
Approval process of a proposed planned unit development.
(1)
Pre-application conference.
a.
Within 30 days of submission of the application for request of approval for a planned unit development, a public hearing will be scheduled. At least 15 days of notice of the time, place and request will be provided by publishing a notice in the newspaper of general circulation in the city. Attendance at this hearing is required by the owner/developer.
b.
City staff will have 30 days in order to compile comments generated at the public hearing for PUD request and to complete their review of the proposed project.
c.
Planning and zoning commission first reading; advertisement of the request.
d.
Planning and zoning commission second/public hearing; PUD request recommendation.
e.
Mayor and council public hearing; approval/disapproval.
(2)
If the planned unit development request is approved by the mayor and council, then;
a.
Concept plan approval for the planned unit development by the planning and zoning commission.
b.
Individual district concept plan approval by planning and zoning commission.
(e)
Expiration of PUD approval. Approval of a planned unit development is conditional. If significant construction is not commenced within 18 months of the date of the approval of the PUD by the mayor and council and thereafter pursued in an orderly fashion toward completion, or there is any lapse in construction for a period of 12 months, the mayor and council may, after providing 30 days' written notice to the property owner, abolish the entirety of the conditional PUD zoning or terminate the PUD as to portions or districts of the property contained within the originally approved PUD area.
This statement must be included on title sheet of the PUD request and the phased construction plan of the rezoning request.
(f)
Approval required for changes to an approved PUD. All planned unit developments will be approved as a conditional use based upon detailed plans submitted including timeframes for commencing construction and continuation of substantial construction progress. No material changes to the approved plan may be made without review by the planning commission and approval by the mayor and city council. Any variances requested for any portion of development within a PUD shall be brought before the planning and zoning commission in order to seek a recommendation prior to meeting with the board of appeals.
(g)
Planned unit development approval request fees.
(1)
Any taxes, fees, or other liabilities of the land within this request must be paid before the approval process will begin.
(2)
The application fee, which is established by the mayor and city council and amended from time to time, must be paid upon submission of the planned unit application.
(3)
An approved planned unit development is subject to all other fees associated with the continued development of the project including but not limited to subdivision fees, building permit fees, water/sewer fees, etc.

ARTICLE II. - SITE PLANNING AND SPECIFICATIONS

Sec. 114-27. - Purpose; avoiding undesired impacts.
(a)
The site plan, building design, and landscaping of new development should achieve high quality and appearance that will enhance and be compatible with the character of the surrounding area.
(b)
Site planning and design of projects proposed (adjacent to dissimilar land uses) should carefully address the potential undesirable impacts on existing uses. These impacts may include traffic, parking, circulation and safety issues, light and glare, noise, odors, dust control and security concerns.
(Ord. No. 2009-12-14, § 4(intro. ¶), 12-14-2009)
Sec. 114-28. - Protecting the natural environment.
(a)
Evaluate the proposed development's compatibility with the existing environment to determine the limitations and capabilities of the site for development.
(b)
Conserve and protect natural resources, including air quality, trees, natural vegetation, existing topography, streams, creeks, wetlands, watersheds, water quality, and wildlife habitat. Development should be limited to a level that does not exceed the capabilities and requirements of a healthy environment.
(c)
Significant site features such as habitats, natural ground forms, existing site vegetation, large rock outcroppings, water, and significant view corridors should be identified and incorporated into development plans. Where possible, a diversity of habitats is preferred.
(d)
Riparian zones, stream corridors, and wetlands should be protected for their wildlife habitat and other values. Development plans for these areas should treat these components as assets. A continuous, connected, natural vegetative corridor should be preserved along all creek and stream corridors to provide stream quality protection and for the efficient movement of wildlife throughout the area. No fill, removal, or modification of a riparian area should take place, unless there is no reasonable and feasible alternative. The alteration or improvement of significant natural resource areas, where permitted, should ensure that potential losses are mitigated and best management practices are employed to minimize permanent damage. (See Figure.)
Retention of Vegetated Stream Corridor
Source: Dramstad, Olson and Forman 1996.
(e)
Existing vegetation should be retained to the maximum extent possible. Clearing of native vegetation should be limited to that required for the provision of essential purposes (i.e., access, building, sewage disposal, etc.). Where appropriate, existing native vegetation should be enhanced with plantings of the same variety.
(f)
Preserve patches of high-quality habitat, as large and circular as possible, feathered at the edges, and connected by wildlife corridors. (See Figure.)
Habitat Patch Preservation and Connection
Source: Dramstad, Olson and Forman 1996.
When continuous greenspace corridors cannot be provided or must be broken up for road access or other valid reasons, patches should be retained as "stepping stones" for wildlife corridors. (See Figure.)
Stepping Stones

Sec. 114-29. - Site grading.
(a)
Developments should be designed to fit the existing contours and landform of the site and to minimize the amount of earthwork. Excavation and earthwork should be kept to a minimum to reduce visual impacts and erosion. Where cut and fill is required, balancing the cut and fill is highly encouraged.
(b)
Abrupt or unnatural-appearing grading is strongly discouraged. Avoid the creation of harsh, easily eroded banks and cuts.
(c)
The height and length of retaining walls should be minimized and screened with appropriate landscaping. Tall, smooth-faced concrete retaining walls should be avoided in highly visible areas. Terracing should be considered as an alternative to the use of tall or prominent retaining walls, particularly in highly visible areas on hillsides.
(d)
Disturbed areas that are not used for roads, buildings, or other auxiliary uses should be replanted.
(Ord. No. 2009-12-14, § 4.2, 12-14-2009)
Sec. 114-30. - Drainage.
(a)
Natural on-site drainage patterns should be used where practicable. Detain runoff with open, natural drainage systems where possible.
(b)
Design manmade lakes and stormwater ponds for maximum habitat value and/or to serve as amenity features. (See Figure.)
Drainage Feature as an Amenity
(Ord. No. 2009-12-14, § 4.3, 12-14-2009)
Sec. 114-31. - PUD residential districts.
(a)
Description. The residential districts within a PUD are intended to provide for predominantly residential but mixed-use developments that are designed according to the principles of "new urbanism" with a grid or modified-grid street network, pedestrian scale and orientation, shallow front yards, relatively narrow local streets planted with shade trees and provided with wide sidewalks, and with automobile garages accessed via alleys or located to the rear of residential lots. PUD residential districts are further distinguished from conventional suburban subdivision developments in their provision of public greens or common areas. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
Consistent: grid pattern of blocks and streets. The PUD residential development consists of a recognizable pattern of diverse land uses. Park blocks or greens are dispersed, usually with a random rather than regular pattern. Moving away from the commercial districts, office uses and higher density residential uses (which may or may not be permitted in a given PUD project), stepping down further in intensity and density, the more outlying blocks in the PUD residential development are detached, single-family dwellings on their own lots, usually fairly narrow in width (50—70 feet). Alley access is encouraged and may be required. School and/or church sites are a part of the neighborhood "fabric." Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
Consistent (above): "Cottage"" or small houses located close to the street, with gabled roofs and front porches, and with garage access at rear of lot. Accessory apartment above garage (subject to limitations). Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
Consistent: Dwelling contains front porch and is located close to street. Minimal side yard setbacks. Garage is detached at located at rear of lot. Lot size is 50—60 feet in width and approximately 100—130 feet in depth (4,000 to 16,000 square feet of lot area). Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
Consistent: House with front porch close to street. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
Consistent: PUD street view: The original settlement pattern sets the character and establishes building themes that should be continued, including location of buildings close to the street and porches on the front of dwellings. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
Consistent: Streets with street trees and sidewalks. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
Consistent: Three-story, higher density dwelling designed to face a green; buildings abut the sidewalk. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
Consistent: Townhouses have auto access to the rear of the lots via an alley, if permitted or conditionally permitted. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
(b)
Pedestrian access and sidewalks. The site plan must demonstrate that the project will be designed in a way that gives preference to pedestrian (including transit users, where transit is available) versus vehicular access. To this end, the applicant shall identify and present a pedestrian access plan that provides pedestrian access connections to compatible adjacent properties and the public sidewalk system. Sidewalks meeting or exceeding local construction specifications shall be provided by the developer along all streetscapes abutting road corridors. Sidewalks meeting said specifications shall also be required to be installed by the developer along all other streets abutting the development area and along public and private through streets within the developments.
(c)
Streetscape improvements. The site plan of proposed development must demonstrate that the development will comply with the streetscape improvements. Where not taken up by a building, the first ten feet of private property abutting the right-of-way of the street shall be improved as a streetscape with an appropriate combination of the following elements: one or more pedestrian plazas or public use areas containing benches and shelters; amenity features such as low-lying walls or fountains; landscaping including street/shade trees; pedestrian-scale signage and development identification monuments; bicycle parking facilities; and steps or landings leading to buildings with retail or office-institutional uses on the ground floor with storefront windows. The local government may require a general purpose utility and streetscape easement of ten feet in width if needed along the road right-of-way if additional right-of-way is needed and cannot be acquired.
(d)
Maximum building setback. Buildings shall be placed close to (with little if any setback from) streets internal to the development, and along public streets abutting the development area, as determined in the site plan review and approval process.
(e)
Residential uses and open spaces. Residential areas should be designed in a grid-like pattern of blocks and interconnecting streets. Block length should not exceed 800 feet without intervening (mid-block) pedestrian access ways. Central residential areas should be designed in a grid-like pattern of blocks and interconnecting streets and alleys, and block length should not exceed 500 feet. Open spaces, such as town greens and public squares, should be located and designed to add to the visual amenities of the neighborhood and individual development. Greens and squares should be spatially defined and distributed throughout the village so that no lot is more than a walking distance of 2,000 feet from a green, square, park, or designated open space. Greens and squares should not be less than 8,000 square feet in area.
(f)
Non-residential and mixed uses. Enclosed retail trade establishments, personal service establishments, and related non-residential uses, if proposed and permitted, shall be located in careful relation to other land uses within and outside of the development. Such uses must be scaled to the pedestrian and to the district itself. The storefront area should contain retail uses, professional offices, and personal or professional services in 1½ story buildings where each individual establishment is typically 1,500 square feet or less, and up to 3,500 square feet when located in buildings of two or more stories. Buildings containing residential units, usually on an upper story (i.e., vertical mixed-use development) are particularly encouraged. Storefront buildings should have at least 60 feet of their front facade coincident with their street frontage. Preferably, storefront buildings fronting the same street and located on the same block should be attached on the sides, except as necessary to accommodate pedestrian ways.
(Ord. No. 2009-12-14, § 4.4, 12-14-2009)
Sec. 114-32. - PUD Commercial District.
(a)
Description. This district establishes and maintains areas of commerce that are designed first and foremost with attention to the pedestrian rather than the automobile. Sidewalks are wide enough for significant pedestrian activity and auto and truck access is limited in areas of pedestrian activity. Buildings frame the street by being located close to the street and with a height of at least two stories. The buildings, many of which are retail shops, have awnings and storefront windows that add interest to pedestrians. Signs are smaller and closer to the ground, rather than being sized and located to attract motorists. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
Consistent: Two-story or taller building heights, canopies and awnings, wide sidewalks with street trees; on-street parking. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
Consistent: Building frames the street. Sidewalk provided. Street tree planting strip in between on-street parking and the sidewalk. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
Consistent: Storefront retail spaces have awnings and are located abutting a wide sidewalk. On-street parking and street trees. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
(b)
Building placement. Buildings should be placed close to (with little if any setback from) streets internal to the development, or along public streets abutting the development area, as determined in the development review and approval process. The buildings should be generally placed so that the main entrance is oriented to the street sidewalk. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk.
(c)
Ground floors. The ground level of multi-story buildings should contain retail or entertainment uses with direct entry from the street to provide pedestrian interest along sidewalks. Pedestrian interest can be enhanced with use of windows, entrances, and architectural details. Pedestrian signage, awnings, and ornamentation are encouraged.
Consistent: Storefront windows should be transparent. Mirrored glass, faux windows or display casements are strongly discouraged.
Consistent: Grid block pattern. Buildings are not set back much if any from streets and they frame the street frontage and street corners. Two-story height for buildings desirable. Parking is mostly behind buildings (some on-street parking is permitted).
Source: Arendt, Randall, et al. Rural By Design: Maintaining Small Town Character, Figure 9-2, p. 118. (Chicago: Planners Press, 1994).
Inconsistent: Mostly single-story development with parking in the front of buildings. Strip shopping center has little if any articulation (projections and recesses). Individual development sites are not coordinated with one another.
Consistent: Skinny streets (one-way shown) with shade trees. Decorative post-top street lighting is pedestrian scale. Sidewalk constructed of distinctive materials rather than regular concrete or asphalt. Directional sign is small and low to the ground (pedestrian scale).
(Ord. No. 2009-12-14, § 4.4, 12-14-2009)
Sec. 114-33. - Mixed-Use/Multi-Family High District.
(a)
Description. This district has many of the same characteristics as the pedestrian retail district, but with greater mix of land uses. The activity center is an organized and pre-planned village center with a mixture of residential, civic/institutional, office, commercial and formal open spaces done following principles of New England-style town planning, new urbanism, traditional neighborhood development, and/or urban planning and redevelopment.
(b)
Land use mix. No less than 20 percent of total gross floor area of buildings within this district shall contain commercial/office uses, excluding any building areas that would customarily be considered typical non-unit residential uses (i.e., lobbies and common areas for residential units)
(c)
Live/work units. Mixed-use districts may include live/work units.
