( Ord. No. 01-15 , § 1, 3-17-2015)
Sec. 6-170. - Off-site sewer facilities costs; sewer bond issue.
(a)
The cost of the off-site sewer facilities including the sewer line from the Muscogee County line to the property, including financing costs, is approximately $5,400,000.00.
(b)
The authority has financed the installation costs and costs of issuance of the bonds through a revenue bond issue (the "bonds") in an amount which includes actual cost of planning, designing and installing the off-site sewer facilities, plus bond issuance.
( Ord. No. 01-15 , § 1, 3-17-2015)
Sec. 6-171. - Bond fund.
(a)
The authority has agreed in the Intergovernmental Contract and Service Agreement to deposit into a separate fund known as the "bond fund" the following promptly upon receipt:
(1)
Advanced sewer tap fees provided for below;
(2)
Amounts pursuant to the Intergovernmental Contract received from the county equal to cash sewer tap fees for the property;
(3)
Amounts pursuant to the Intergovernmental Contract received from the county equal to the special sewer tax, if any, as provided below.
The Intergovernmental Contract and the Service Agreement make provision for the following, as set forth below in this paragraph. The bond fund will be invested and investment returns (within the limits of applicable arbitrage and rebate rules) will be added to the fund. Amounts in the bond fund will be applied only to the payment of principal and interest on the bonds. If the bond fund is sufficient to pay all interest, prepayment premium (if any), principal and other charges with respect to the bonds, and if the bonds are subject to optional prepayment, the authority, at its own instance, may, or upon written request by the developer will, apply the bond fund to the prepayment, in whole or in part, of the bonds at the earliest practicable time.
(b)
The Intergovernmental Contract and the Service Agreement provide that authority will cause to be maintained proper books and records of the bond fund, including deposits and withdrawals with an explanation of each item, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and will make the books and records available for inspection by the developer at all reasonable times.
( Ord. No. 01-15 , § 1, 3-17-2015)
Sec. 6-172. - Advanced sewer tap fees.
(a)
In order to provide financial assurance to the authority for the repayment of the bonds, the developer has agreed to 30 days in advance of each of the first 14 semiannual payment dates of the bonds (or until the bonds are paid in full, if earlier) pay, if amounts expected in the bond fund will not be sufficient to pay the debt service on the bonds in the coming year, the sum necessary to satisfy such insufficiency to the authority ("advanced sewer tap fees") as an advance on its tap fee credit (described in the following paragraph (b)). Such obligation of the developer was to be secured prior to the issuance of the bonds by guarantees or letters of credit in a manner satisfactory to the authority. The Service Agreement provides that the developer has the right, but not the obligation, to pay to the authority additional amounts to be applied to payment of the bonds and treated as advanced sewer tap fees.
(b)
The Intergovernmental Contract provided that the developer shall be given a sewer tap fee credit ("tap fee credit") equal to the sum of the advanced sewer tap fees theretofore paid to the authority by the developer not applied as provided below, that the tap fee credit shall be personal property of the developer, and that so long as no project deficiency has occurred and is continuing, upon request by the developer, sewer tap fees otherwise to be charged by the county for the property shall be treated as paid by and deducted from the tap fee credit. The Intergovernmental Contract provides that no transferee of any part of the property is to acquire any rights to the tap fee credit unless the developer, with notice to the county and the authority, in writing transfers such rights to the transferee; provided, however, that the developer shall remain responsible, liable and bound to all obligations under the Service Agreement notwithstanding any such assignment. The Intergovernmental Contract further provides that upon the exhaustion of the tap fee credit (which may be re-established by any additional advanced sewer tap fees paid hereunder), the county shall be entitled to receive in cash all sewer tap fees with respect to the property, subject to its obligation under the Intergovernmental Contract to pay amounts equal to certain sewer tap fees to the authority for deposit in the bond fund.
( Ord. No. 01-15 , § 1, 3-17-2015)
Sec. 6-173. - Special tax district.
The property identified as Harris County Tax Parcels 032-003, 032-039, 032-040, 032-042, 032-043A, 033-014, and 033-015 as designated and numbered by the Tax Assessor of Harris County as of January 1, 2015 is hereby and shall be designated as a special tax district. In the event that the amount reasonably expected to be in the bond fund for the next calendar year is not sufficient to pay the principal and interest payments on the bonds due in the year, the county shall levy a "special sewer tax" (herein so called) on the special tax district for the subject year in the amount estimated to make up the insufficiency (a "debt service deficiency") and payable in time to meet debt service on the bonds, and that amounts equal to the special sewer tax receipts shall be paid to the authority pursuant to the intergovernmental contract and be deposited by the authority in the bond fund. In the event the developer defaults on the payment of its obligations in Section 4.3 of the Service Agreement to pay advanced sewer tap fees, the county shall levy, without duplication, a special sewer tax on the special tax district for the subject year in the amount of the default of the developer, and such special sewer tax receipts, if sufficient, shall be treated as curing the default in the payment of advanced sewer tap fees under Section 4.3(a) of the Service Agreement; and any excess of such receipts shall be paid to the authority pursuant to the intergovernmental contract and be deposited in the bond fund.
Any tax levied as a special tax hereunder shall be levied on all of the foregoing Harris County Tax parcels regardless of the ownership of said property at the time of the levy. The county shall have its usual liens and remedies to collect any special sewer tax. The special tax district designation will be removed upon payment in full of the bonds.
