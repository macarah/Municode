(Res. of 6-9-03, § 4-12)
Sec. 14-58. - Intersection design.
Intersection design shall be in compliance with the specifications contained in Table 14.3.6 and as follows. These standards shall govern for all residential-residential, residential-collector, and collector-collector intersections.
(1)
Intersections shall be designed with flat grade wherever practical. In rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided.
(2)
Centerline grades are to meet at the crown of each roadway unless the proposed road is a local road connecting to a collector or arterial road. In such case the proposed road centerline shall match the edge of pavement.
(3)
Intersection design shall be in compliance with the specifications contained in Table 14.3.6. These standards shall govern for all residential-residential, residential-collector, and collector-collector intersections.
(4)
The intersection of two roads shall be designed to provide proper sight distance. Minimum sight distances as shown in Table 14.3.6 are required at all intersections.
(5)
Where any intersection is created which would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility within the clear sight distance, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to comply with the sight distance requirements of this ordinance and shall not erect any sign or improvement which would preclude safe sight distance.
(6)
It shall be required that all intersection approaches meet at approximately a 90 degree angle. Mitigating circumstances may require the intersection approach to meet at an angle less 90 degrees; however, such approved angle shall not be less than 75 degrees. Any oblique road shall be curved approaching an intersection and shall be approximately at right angles for at least 50 feet therefrom. Not more than two roads shall intersect at any specific point.
(7)
Offsets of at least 150 feet between centerlines shall be required between local roads. In the case of two collector road intersections, this offset shall be increased to at least 200 feet in order to allow for left-turn storage between intersections.
(8)
When offset intersections are used at an arterial; they should be located to avoid conflicting left turns. Such left-turn conflicts exist when an intersection offsets to the right rather than to the left.
(9)
For a local road intersecting a local road, any proposed new intersections along one side of an existing road shall coincide, wherever practicable, with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such road.
(10)
It is desirable to provide a tangent section of roadway approaching intersections, when the road leg has a minimum or near-minimum radius curve. The guideline values in Table 14.3.6 would not apply to a collector with a 1,000-foot radius that is intersected by a residential street. It would apply to an intersecting residential road with a 200-foot radius leg.

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. of 12-1-06, § 3, adopted Dec. 1, 2006, amended and replaced the former Art. VI, §§ 14-71—14-81, and enacted a new Art. VI as set out herein. The former Art. VI pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Res. of 6-9-03, §§ 6-1—6-10, and § 6-81.

Sec. 14-71. - Purpose of the article.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain, and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It is determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure; safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public; and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities which protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(2)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in its post-development state as nearly as practicable, in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, non-point source pollution, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(3)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(4)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities which can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(5)
Encourage the use of non-structural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable;
(6)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater, control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure continued functionality as designed, maintenance, and that they pose no threat to public safety; and,
(7)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

Stormwater means any surface flow, runoff, or drainage consisting entirely of water from any form of natural precipitation, and resulting from such precipitation.
Stormwater design manual means the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM,) current edition, as published by the Atlanta Regional Commission. The Georgia Stormwater Management Manual is available online at www.georgiastormwater.org.
Stormwater facility means a structural stormwater management facility or device that controls stormwater runoff and changes the characteristics of that runoff including, but not limited to, the quantity, the quality, the period of release or the velocity of flow.
Undisturbed natural buffer means a tract of land in its natural undisturbed state where no vegetation can be removed or planted without a county permit. No herbicides, pesticides, or other chemicals, either natural or manmade can be used in this buffer without a county permit.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this ordinance. A structure or other development without evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 14-78. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria.
The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article:
(a)
Stormwater runoff quality/Reduction. Stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
(1)
The system is designed to retain the first 1.0 inch of rainfall on site to the maximum extent practicable. The determination by the County that it is infeasible to apply the stormwater runoff quality/reduction standard, on part or all of a project, must be documented with the site plan review documents. If the first 1.0 inch of rainfall can be retained onsite using runoff reduction methods, then no additional water quality treatment is required. If the 1.0 inch cannot be retained onsite, the remaining runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event must be treated to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the LDM and GSMM;
(2)
Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained in accordance with the specific criteria in the LDM; and,
(3)
Runoff from "hotspot" land uses and activities identified in the LDM are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices.
(b)
Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
(1)
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer;
(2)
Twenty-four hour extended detention storage of the one year, 24 hour return frequency storm event; and,
(3)
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.
All design and construction work that is undertaken proximate to stream channels (including the buffer areas) shall be in strict conformance with current local, state, and federal regulations.
(c)
Flood protection. Flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying storm events such that flooding is not exacerbated for the storm events specified in the LDM and in accordance with applicable requirements in article VI hereof.
(d)
Drainage system guidelines. A system emphasizing a natural as opposed to an engineered drainage strategy shall be encouraged. The applicability of a natural approach depends upon such factors as site storage capacity, open channel hydraulic capacity, maintenance needs/resources and regulatory permitting factors. Stormwater conveyance facilities may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutters, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public and private properties adjoining project sites. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry stormwater runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following additional requirements:
(1)
Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the LDM;
(2)
All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the LDM; and,
(3)
Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the LDM.

Sec. 14-79. - Maintenance of facilities.
(1)
Stormwater detention facilities which are deemed to be an essential and integral part of the Whitfield County stormwater management program may be maintained by Whitfield County. Stormwater management facilities which are built to satisfy this article for non-residential developments, and function for only one owner of a parcel of land in fee simple, will not be maintained by Whitfield County, and the owner thereof shall meet the requirements of the subsequent provisions of this article. No stormwater detention facility shall be accepted for maintenance by the county without first being approved by the Whitfield County Board of Commissioners.
In order to facilitate the maintenance of said stormwater detention facilities, a drainage easement shall be provided which will at a minimum encompass the 100-year flood elevation contour plus ten feet. The ten feet shall be measured horizontally outward from the 100-year flood elevation contour. A 20-foot access easement shall be provided from an existing or proposed right-of-way to the said stormwater detention facility. The access easement shall be improved so as to allow for periodic usage for the purpose of maintenance of the stormwater management facility.
(2)
An inspection and maintenance agreement shall be executed for all private on-site stormwater management facilities prior to approval of the final plat or issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Such agreement shall be in form and content acceptable to the county, and shall provide that all inspection, maintenance and repair procedures of such facilities shall be the responsibility of the property owner. Such agreement shall provide for access to the facility by virtue of a non-exclusive perpetual easement in favor of Whitfield County at reasonable times for regular inspection by the county administrator, director, public works director, or his or her designee.
a.
The agreement shall provide that preventive maintenance inspections of infiltration systems, retention, or detention structures may be made by the county, at its option. The county's inspection schedule shall be established on a frequency that meets the intent of this article and applicable regulatory compliance requirements bestowed on the county.
b.
The agreement shall provide that if, after an inspection, the condition of a facility presents an immediate danger to the public health, safety or general welfare because of unsafe conditions or improper maintenance, the county shall have the right, but not the duty, to take such action as may be necessary to protect the public health, safety, general welfare and adjacent properties from damage. If it is determined that such deficient conditions are the result of neglected maintenance, or other action caused by the property owner, then any cost incurred by Whitfield County shall be paid by the property owner as set forth in subsection d. below.
c.
The maintenance agreement shall be recorded by the property owner in the land records of Whitfield County prior to approval of the final plat or issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
d.
The agreement shall provide that the county shall notify the property owner(s) of the facility of any violation, deficiency or failure to comply with this article. The agreement shall also provide that upon a failure to correct violations requiring maintenance work, within 30 days after notice thereof, the county may provide for all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. The owner(s) of the facility shall be assessed the costs of the work performed by the county pursuant to this subsection and subsection b. above, and there shall be a lien upon all property of the owner in which said property utilizes, or will utilize such facility in achieving stormwater management, which lien, when filed in Whitfield County real estate records, shall have the same status and priority as liens for non-payment of ad valorem; taxes. Should such a lien be filed, portions of the affected property may be released by Whitfield County following the payments by the owner of such portion of the property of such owner's pro-rata share of the lien amount based upon the acreage to be released with such release amount to be determined by the Whitfield County Board of Commissioners.
(3)
In lieu of an inspection and maintenance agreement, the Whitfield County Board of Commissioners may, at their discretion, accept dedication of any existing or future regional stormwater management facility for perpetual maintenance by Whitfield County, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this article, the LDM, and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular structural maintenance by the county.
