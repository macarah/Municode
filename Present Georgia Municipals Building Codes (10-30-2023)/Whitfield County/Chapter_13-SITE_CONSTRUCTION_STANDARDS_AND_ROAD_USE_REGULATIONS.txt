ARTICLE I. - SITE CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS

Sec. 13-1. - Earthwork.
(a)
The entire area within the typical grading section shall be cleared and grubbed of all trees, bushes, stumps and debris. Such debris shall be disposed of in a satisfactory manner, but in no instance, shall be used as fill in the road bed.
(b)
Grading shall be accurately done to the lines and grades shown on the plans. Embankments shall be placed in uniform layers not to exceed six inches and compacted to a density of 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry weight per cubic foot as determined by an approved method. Proof-rolling shall be accomplished prior to placement of embankments to detect soft spots.
Slopes in Cut or Fill Sections
EXPAND
Depth of Cut or Fill Slopes
(Maximum)
2 feet or less 4 to 1
2 feet to 5 feet 3 to 1
Over 5 feet 2 to 1
  The depth of cut referenced in the table shall be construed to be the maximum cut or fill occurring in any one section of cut or fill. The slope on cut or fill shall be uniform throughout for each section of cut or fill. When a cut is made in rock that requires blasting, slope may be changed to vertical slope upon the written approval of the authorized county representative.
(c)
After the earth work has been completed, all storm drainage and other underground utilities have been installed under the roadbed, and the backfill in all such ditches thoroughly compacted, the subgrade shall be brought to the lines, grades and cross section shown on the plans. If any sections of the subgrade are composed of unsuitable or unstable material, such material shall be removed to the depth directed by the road department and replaced with suitable, thoroughly compacted material. When the street is to be used for construction traffic before the paving work is completed, a layer of No. 5 stone can be laid as a traffic surface if the developer so desires, provided:
(1)
This material shall not be used as a part of the base material;
(2)
It may be worked into the subgrade or it shall be removed before the base course is set up for paving;
(3)
Provision shall be made to drain low points in road construction when the final paving surface is delayed.
(d)
It shall be the responsibility of the developer to provide core samples to verify compaction requirements from a certified company to the road department.
Sec. 13-2. - Storm drainage.
(a)
Sizing and location of all drainage structures shall be the responsibility of a registered professional land surveyor, subject to approval of the road department.
Storm drainage pipes shall be sloped so as to maintain a minimum velocity of 3fps so that sediment will not collect.
State Highway Standard 1030D (or most current) shall be used in determining class (concrete) or gauge of pipe under fill, method of backfilling and pipe installation, unless otherwise specified and approved by the road department.
Unless specified otherwise, the drainage formula used in determining size of drainage structure shall be determined by Q=CIA Formula.
Talbot's Formula shall use .80 run-off index or the equivalent.
Rational method shall use 50-year storm or rain as the stated frequency.
Drainage easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide when used as an open ditch. Piped storm drainage shall have a minimum easement width of 15 feet wide.
Catchbasins and/or drop inlets shall be designed by an engineer and subject to final approval by the road department.
Streetwater shall be limited to a maximum distance as follows: 400 feet on grades up to seven percent; 300 feet on grades from seven percent to ten percent; 250 feet on grades over ten percent.
Subdrainage will be installed to control the surplus groundwater by intercepting sidehill seepage or by lowering or regulating the groundwater level where such conditions exist.
Bridges shall be designed on a 50-year storm frequency.
(b)
Cross drainpipes shall not be less than 18 inches in size when under the street and 15 inches under driveways.
Headwalls of a type approved by the county road department shall be required on inlet and outlet ends of the cross drain pipe.
A full shoulder width shall be maintained across all cross drains as the minimum length.
The maximum continuous length of side drain (ditch) pipe shall be 50 feet. A cleanout (open-top graded) catch basin shall be established at each 50-foot interval. The maximum continuous length of longitudinal pipe shall not exceed 300 feet.
Junction boxes having access to the pipe shall be constructed to meet the requirements of Georgia DOT Standard 1030D (or most current).
(c)
Reinforced concrete pipe shall be used within the right-of-way. Pipe outside the right-of-way may be reinforced concrete, at the option of the owner, or other appropriate material.
Flat bottom and circular pipe sections shall be laid in a prepared trench with the socket ends pointing upstream. Sections shall be joined in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
Metal pipe shall be fully coated.
Corrugated aluminum or steel pipe and pipe-arches sections shall be laid in a prepared trench with outside laps of circumference joints pointing upstream and with longitudinal joints at the sides. Coupling bands, fastened by two or more bolts, shall join the sections. The space between adjoining sections shall be not more than the width of one corrugation.
All damaged spots in galvanized coating that expose the base metal shall be repaired before the structure is backfilled. All damaged spots in bituminous coating that expose the base metal shall be recoated with asphalt before the structure is backfilled.
Elongation of metal pipes shall be as shown on the plans. The contractor shall order the elongation of the vertical axis of the pipe to be done in the shop. Corrugated metal pipe shall be shipped with wire-tie in the pipe ends. Wire-ties shall be removed as soon as possible after the fill is completed.
(d)
Before any traffic over a storm drain is allowed, the developer shall provide an adequate depth and width of compacted backfill to protect the structure from damage or displacement. Any debris or silt that constructs the flow through a pipe shall be removed by the developer as often as necessary to maintain drainage. All pipe structures shall be cleaned before the work is accepted. Any damage or displacement that may occur due to traffic or erosion shall be repaired or corrected at the developer's expense. The developer's obligation to clean and repair pipes ceases after acceptance of the system by the county.
(e)
Minimum clearances are one foot between the bottom of the roadway base and the exterior crown of the culvert. A minimum of 0.5 feet between underground utilities and exterior crown of culverts.
(f)
Trench construction for storm drainage pipe shall be in accordance with standard drawings.

Such security shall be in an amount equal to ten percent of the actual costs of construction of such improvements.
Secs. 13-4—13-20. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - ROAD USE REGULATIONS

Sec. 13-21. - When a utility may be closed or altered.
(a)
Any utility using or occupying any part of a county road which the department has undertaken to improve or intends to improve shall remove and relocate its facility when, in the reasonable opinion of the department, the facility constitutes an obstruction or interference with the use or safe operation of such road by the travelling public or when, in the reasonable opinion of the department, the facility will interfere with such contemplated construction or maintenance.
(b)
Whenever the department reasonably determines it necessary to have a utility facility removed and relocated, the department shall give to the utility at least 60 days' written notice directing the removal and relocation of such utility obstruction. If the utility does not thereafter begin removal within a reasonable time sufficient to allow for engineering and other procedures reasonably necessary to the removal and relocation of the utility facility, the department may give the utility a final notice directing that such removal shall commence not later than ten days from the receipt of such final notice. If such utility does not, within ten days from receipt of such final notice, begin to remove or relocate the facility or, having so begun removal or relocation, thereafter fails to complete the removal or relocation within a reasonable time, the department may remove or relocate the same with its own employees or by employing or contracting for the necessary engineering, labor, tools, equipment, supervision, or other necessary services or materials and whatever else is necessary to accomplish the removal or relocation.
(c)
The expenses incurred by the department as a result of utility removal and relocation pursuant to subsection (b), above, shall be paid by the utility. A statement of such expenses shall be submitted to the utility, which shall make payment to Whitfield County, Georgia. In the event the utility does not make payment or arrange to make payment to the county, within 60 days after the receipt of said statement, the department shall certify the amount for collection to the county attorney.
Sec. 13-22. - Permit requirements and procedures.
(1)
Purpose. The purpose of the permit process is to regulate and control modification of and access to the county highway system. Regulations are necessary in order to preserve the functional integrity of the county highway system and to promote the safe and efficient movement of people and goods within the county. The development of a management program serves to protect the traveling public through an orderly control of traffic entering and leaving the county highway system, to prevent hazardous parking adjacent to the travel way, to insure uniform design and construction of driveways on the county highway system, to make certain that modification of the county right-of-way [does not create unsafe conditions for the traveling public, to prevent unauthorized use of county right-of-way] and to allow beautification of property fronting on the county highway system. The permit process applies to all roads under the jurisdiction of Whitfield County.
(2)
Permit required. Any third party desiring to physically modify any portion of a county road shall first file with the office of the county road superintendent an application in writing in such form as the county road superintendent may prescribe, and obtain a formal permit for such modification.
(3)
Application and approval procedure.
(a)
Application forms. Applications for the various permits must be made on the proper form. These forms may be obtained from the department. Only original forms may be used when making application for one of these permits. Each copy of the application must be signed in ink by the applicant. Application forms will not be furnished for future needs; rather, they will be provided for each permit request after the geometric design and location of the requested driveway and/or other encroachments are agreed upon.
(b)
Applicant qualifications. Application for a permit under these rules will be accepted only from the property owner, leasor or an official representing the company, organization or group which owns or leases the property abutting the R/W and upon which the driveway or other permit work will be constructed. In the event the applicant leases the property, the lease should be for a period of at least three years, or the permit must be issued to the property owner. In any case, written acknowledgement of the permit work must be obtained from the owner or his agent.
(c)
Where to file application. Applications must be filed with the Whitfield County Road Department.
(d)
Plan requirements. A plan must accompany the application which complies with the department's commercial driveway specifications or other encroachments. In addition, the department require in appropriate circumstances to be determined by the department whether a plan should accompany any other application. Data relative to the requested permit must be furnished by the applicant without cost to the department. The permit engineer is available for consultation and advice in these matters to help the applicant develop a plan and design to serve his development while working within the rules and regulations of the department.
(e)
Provisions of a permit. The provisions of any permit granted shall be construed as regulatory and not as contractual. No interest or right of an applicant shall be transferred to another except by written consent of the department. No inherent or related right or privilege belonging to any abutting property owner is affected, interfered with or abridged by these standards or by any permit issued thereunder, nor is the county responsible for any damage claim which may arise as between the applicant and any adjacent property owner.
(f)
Cost. The department does not charge for these permits at this time. However, the applicant must furnish copies of the approved plans and is responsible for all engineering and construction costs, unless the provisions of the resolution of the Board of Commissioners of Whitfield County dated January 25, 1994 amended July 26, 1994 pertaining to certain installations of drainage pipe and drain tile apply. Job review and inspection and limited engineering service may be rendered by the department during the time the work is being accomplished. When the complexity of the work requires continuous inspection, as determined by the county road superintendent. This determination and an estimate of inspection costs will be made part of the approved permit.
(g)
Department approval. The processing of permits will be accomplished by department personnel in an expeditious manner. The district permit engineer will see that all requests for permits are acted on in a timely fashion.
(4)
Conditions placed on permits. The conditions enumerated in this subsection are agreed to by the applicant for a driveway or encroachment permit and are part of the terms of such permit. These conditions to the permit continue in effect unless changes are made or authorized by the department.
(a)
General restrictions.
1.
Parking is prohibited on county roads except in those instances where temporary conditional special encroachment permit is approved for parking on the R/W.
2.
Driveways shall not be provided within the R/W for purposes of parking, loading, servicing, etc.
3.
Geometric and safety requirements must be maintained as stipulated in the permit and shall not be altered by the applicant.
4.
An approved permit must be picked up by the applicant within 60 days of approval. If not, the permit must be canceled.
5.
Work under the permit must begin within 90 days after approval. Failure to begin work will be cause for the permit to be canceled.
6.
Construction work authorized by an approved permit should be completed within 12 months following approval of the permit. Permitted work not completed within 12 months, for just reasons, may be officially extended for additional six-month increments.
7.
New driveways to new businesses should not be opened for use by the traveling public until the final inspection.
(b)
Liability and responsibility of applicant.
1.
Applicants to whom permits have been approved shall at all times indemnify and save harmless the department and county from responsibility for any damages or liability arising from the maintenance, repair, operation or use of any installation, parts of installation, construction procedures or actual construction approved under the permit. When determined necessary by the department, the applicant must exhibit satisfactory evidence of adequate liability insurance to cover all phases of work specified under the permit for the protection of the traveling public. Limits of such coverage shall be determined separately for each applicant and declared by the department at its discretion.
2.
The applicant must move, relocate or remove any installation or construction placed on DOT R/W without cost to Whitfield County when instructed in writing to do so by the department.
(c)
Permit change or modification. No driveway approach or other improvement constructed on a county road as an exercise of the permit shall be relocated or its dimensions altered without the written permission of the department.
(d)
Property interest. No property interest is created by the granting of a permit even if the applicant, or his transferee or a subsequent transferee, has incurred expenses or expended effort in reliance on such permit.
(5)
Violation of conditions in permit. A violation of conditions specified in a permit shall be grounds for revocation of the permit, removing, correcting, barricading, displacing or closing such driveway and restoring the R/W.
Sec. 13-23. - Other driveways.
(1)
Utility driveways. Access to utility sites such as power substations, water tanks, or telephone service sites are to be permitted and should be treated much the same as a residential drive for design and sight distance. The vehicle must not reduce sight distance for driveways located along the same section of roadway. A utility driveway may or may not count as one allowed access point along an applicant's frontage, depending on the length of frontage and safety considerations.
(2)
Farm use, logging and mining driveways. These driveways are to be permitted by the department in a manner similar to a utility driveway. A logging driveway will usually be a temporary drive which will either be removed when the logging operation is completed or left in to become a farm use driveway. A mining operation may require a more substantial design to function properly.
Sec. 13-24. - Commercial driveway specifications.
(1)
Purpose. The specifications presented herein are intended to provide basic information for permit approval. When presented with this information, the department can review the application in a timely manner and fulfill its responsibility to preserve the functional integrity of the county highway system and to promote the safe and efficient movement of people and goods throughout the county and to treat all applicants fairly and equitably.
(2)
Plan requirements. Five blue line or black line copies of the plans, "A1" metric series - 594 × 841 mm (22 inches × 34 inches) maximum, will normally be submitted with a properly completed permit application.
(a)
Design information. The following information should be included on, or with, each plan submission:
1.
An overall site plan and location sketch map.
2.
All existing features should be shown with dashed lines and all proposed features shown with solid lines. This should be clearly shown on the plan legend.
3.
Location of all property lines and the names of the property owner on either side of the property being developed.
4.
The distance from the centerline of the highway or road to the R/W line. (A general statement such as "Right-of-Way Varies" is not acceptable.)
5.
Existing and proposed elevations sufficient to show the natural and proposed drainage features within the property to be developed. This should include all of the adjacent highway R/W and any elevations needed to show how water flows once it leaves this property.
6.
A north arrow.
7.
All existing traffic signs within the frontage being developed.
8.
The width of existing roadway pavements, lane widths, lane lines and direction of travel (using directional arrows) within the lanes.
9.
The total length of frontage of the property owned and, if different, the length of the frontage being developed under the permit.
10.
Location, size and type of any trees, shrubs, bushes or other vegetation which exist on county R/W.
11.
The distance from the edge of pavement to the side ditch and the direction of the flow of water within the ditch.
12.
The location and size of any existing and proposed side drain or cross drain culverts.
13.
Location of existing and proposed buildings, pumps, signs, grease racks, wash racks, underground storage tanks, etc.
14.
The proposed driveway width, measured either from face of curb to face of barb or from edge of pavement to edge of pavement. This measurement shall be perpendicular to the centerline of the driveway at its narrowest point.
15.
The distance from the centerline of the driveway to each property line, measured along the R/W line.
16.
Driveways and any new shoulder work on a tangent section should slope downward and away from the edge of pavement for a distance of at least 3.6m (12 feet) at a slope rate of 2.08% (one-quarter) inch per foot), generally, including any accel/decel lane. If located in a super elevated section, all construction should match the superelevation for at least 3.6m (12 feet).
17.
Sight distance at each driveway.
18.
The difference in elevation between the roadway and the driveway at the R/W line. The slope should not be greater than +/- 6.25%, if practical. There are situations which require greater slopes; these should be examined carefully before approving their use. In no case should the slope exceed ten percent.
19.
Georgia DOT Standard 9031-W (wheelchair ramps) must be included at all driveways and streets where sidewalk is installed or there is evidence of pedestrian traffic.
(b)
Driveway encroachment.
1.
Connecting curve or curb return. No portion of a driveway, including the radius, should intersect a curb return or the pavement on a curve connecting two highways or streets.
2.
R/W line projection. No portion of a driveway should be within the area between the normal R/W lines projected to the curbline or edge of pavement at an intersection. The department may waive this provision when a deep R/W or an acute angle formed by the intersection makes such action appropriate.
3.
R/W miter. No part of any driveway should be permitted to encroach upon the R/W miter. The R/W miter is that additional R/W which has been secured for the highway behind the prolongation of the normal R/W lines in order to provide for channelization of traffic or more adequate sight distance.
4.
Intersection features.
a.
The legs, connections, ramps, and other roadway features of a highway intersection or interchange are a part of the intersection or interchange. The safety of the public and the planned movement of traffic require that no driveway be connected with such features for the purpose of serving a commercial business.
b.
A driveway serving a roadside area should not be connected to a service or frontage road of a limited access road in the area where said service road serves the dual purpose of a leg, connector or ramp of an intersection or interchange.
c.
No driveway should be connected to a frontage road or service road in the area where the service road is widened or curved for the connection with an interchange or intersection connection, ramp or leg.
d.
No portion of a driveway, other than a normal radius, should enter the R/W at a point which is less than 7.6m (25 feet) from the point of intersection of the R/W lines. Where limited access R/W exists and the frontage is limited in a manner which would deny all access to the property, this distance may be reduced to 3m (ten feet).
Sec. 13-25. - When a driveway may be closed or altered.
In addition to the conditions agreed to by the applicant, the department may alter or close driveway(s) or require the applicant to alter or close driveway(s) to property abutting county roads for the following reasons:
(a)
If the driveway(s) creates an unreasonable interference with the proper use of a public road by the traveling public.
(b)
When it becomes necessary to use the R/W to widen and improve the existing roadway or to construct service roads or to make any other revisions in location, alignment or grade of the roadway, making the approved drive(s) impractical, hazardous or otherwise objectionable.
Sec. 13-26. - Other encroachments, permit required.
Any third party desiring to encroach upon a county right-of-way for any reason other than to use said right-of-way for its intended purposes must file an encroachment permit application including a site plan, and, if requested by the department, a landscaping plan and a cross-section plan, each of which conforms to the department's standards and specifications.
