DIVISION 3. - FIXED ASSETS RECORD SYSTEM

Sec. 2-180. - Introduction.
(1)
Definition. "Fixed assets" are defined as property belonging to Whitfield County. Items meeting all of the following criteria are recorded on the fixed asset record system:
(a)
Items with a cost of $10,000.00 or more;
(b)
Items with a useful life of at least one year or more;
(c)
Items physically tangible.
These items are usually vehicles, equipment, furniture, and office equipment. The list, however, is exhaustive. Fixed assets may be further defined as capital and non-capital acquisitions made through purchase, donation, seizure, and/or construction for use in day-to-day operations. They are owned by Whitfield County and are intended for use by Whitfield County in service to its citizens.
(2)
Purpose. The primary purpose for recording fixed assets is to ensure stewardship of Whitfield County assets. Detailed and timely fixed asset records demonstrate accountability. Accurate and complete records provide a deterrent to lost or stolen assets and a basis for periodic inventory of those assets. Accurate fixed asset records are necessary in developing comprehensive risk management programs. Quality fixed asset records contribute to accurate financial statements and an unqualified audit opinion. Inadequate fixed asset records could lead to accidental violations of grant programs. Fixed asset records can supply cost estimates and replacement needs during the capital budget process. Asset replacement and enhancement cannot be properly planned without adequate fixed asset records.
The purpose of this manual is to define and describe a set of standard procedures and policies required to record and control the changes in the fixed asset system of Whitfield County. This is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
(3)
Scope. All items meeting one or more of the fixed asset criteria are recorded on the fixed asset record system. Assets with an acquisition cost of $1,000.00 or more are recorded in the annual financial report of Whitfield County.
(4)
Users. The primary users of the fixed asset system include, but are not limited to the following:
(a)
Department heads.
(b)
Board of commissioners—Administrator's office accounting division.
(c)
Internal or external auditors.
The fixed asset record system is maintained in a manner which facilitates ease of use by users.
(5)
Responsibility. Department heads have direct responsibility of all fixed assets purchased for, assigned to or otherwise provided to their department. This includes the legal and ethical obligation of their staff to provide sufficient care and safekeeping of fixed assets. Custodial responsibility obligates the department to give reasonable protection against theft, vandalism, misuse, and destruction of assigned fixed assets. Department heads will be given a quarterly report containing fixed assets assigned to their departments. It is the responsibility of the department heads to review this report and verify the accuracy of the report. If one of the assets on the report is not in the department, it is the departments' responsibility to notify the accounting division immediately. Fixed assets are not to be removed from assigned locations without the permission of the department head.
The accounting division is responsible for administering the fixed asset record system. The primary mission of the accounting division involvement in fixed asset management is to maintain complete and accurate records of all transactions related to the acquisition, use, and eventual disposition of fixed assets. The accounting division is also responsible for reconciliation of fixed asset transactions to the general ledger, implementation and correction of internal audit findings as a result of physical inventory, and presentation of fixed asset data in the Whitfield County Annual Financial Report.
All assets identified as no longer usable by departments are declared surplus. All departments have an opportunity to inspect surplus assets for possible use before they are sold or otherwise disposed. This helps to avoid duplication and unnecessary purchase of assets. Exceptions to this are obsolete, traded, dismantled, donated, and individual sale.
The internal auditor conducts an annual physical inventory of fixed assets. All fixed assets are subject to audit during this process. Internal audit has all responsibility for the physical inventory. This includes scope, timing and all other phases of the physical inventory process.
(Mo. of 12-10-01; Ord. of 12-15-08(1), § 1)
Sec. 2-181. - Acquisition.
Fixed assets can be acquired by Whitfield County in any of the following ways:
(1)
Purchase. This is defined as regular acquisitions of nonconsumable and nonexpendable items with a useful life of at least one year and an acquisition cost of $1,000.00 or more. Fixed assets acquired by purchase are recorded at historical cost. Historical cost is defined as consideration or money given or received. Historical cost also includes any other reasonable and necessary costs incurred to place the asset in its intended location and use.
(2)
Gifts or donations. These are defined as acquisitions from outside agencies, companies or individuals. Normally there is no monetary cost for acquiring these assets. They must meet fixed asset criteria before being recorded on the fixed asset record system. Gifts or donations are recorded at fair market value on the date of acquisition by Whitfield County. Fair market value is the estimated amount at which the fixed asset might exchange between a willing buyer and willing seller. Independent appraisal is used to determine fair market value. In the event this is not feasible or available, the accounting division will determine the fair market value by using average costing.
(3)
Seizure. This is defined as the legal acquisition or condemnation of items awarded to Whitfield County departments/divisions by the courts. Fixed assets acquired through legal seizure or exercise of eminent domain is recorded at the amount expended to the previous owner in the legal process.
(4)
Renovations or improvements. These are defined as betterment's to existing assets that meet fixed asset criteria. Renovation or improvements to existing assets are recorded at the end of each fiscal year. The renovation is recorded as a separate asset on the automated fixed asset record keeping system and shown to be connected to the original asset. Costs considered to be repair and maintenance are recorded as operating expenses. To help distinguish between repair and maintenance or improvements, a 20 percent test is used. If the expenditure for the renovation or improvement is not greater than 20 percent of the original cost of the improved asset, the expenditure will be considered repair and maintenance.
(5)
Construction or fabrication. This is defined as the assembly of assets by Whitfield County or outside companies or individuals for use in the day to day operations of Whitfield County. Constructed assets are recorded at the cost of construction. Construction of major assets may span two or more fiscal years. In this event, the cost of construction is capitalized into construction in progress until construction is complete.
(6)
Found. These are defined as items discovered in the day-to-day operations of Whitfield County or during the annual physical inventory. Their historical cost is normally estimated by the accounting division.
(Mo. of 12-10-01)
Sec. 2-182. - Tagging of fixed assets.
The primary purpose of tagging fixed assets is to maintain a positive identification of assets owned by Whitfield County. Other purposes are to provide an accurate method of identifying individual assets and to facilitate the physical inventory process.
Serialized tags are pre-numbered sequentially and used to tag assets that meet fixed asset criteria. The accounting division has the responsibility of tagging fixed assets with serialized tags within 60 days of payment for an asset.
Whitfield County follows the suggested tag locations set forth in Government Fixed Asset Inventory Systems edited by Paul E. Glick. In the absence of a specific listing for a type of asset, the tag is placed close to the manufacturer's ID plate. In the absence of an ID plate, the tag is placed in an easily readable and accessible location.
(Mo. of 12-10-01)
Sec. 2-183. - Transfers of fixed assets.
Transfers are defined as any movement of an asset by virtue of change in location. Transfers can occur between different departments. Fixed asset transfers require the authorization of the effected department heads. Assets can be transferred by loan or permanent movement. Each type of transfer is explained further below.
A loan occurs when a fixed asset is being used temporarily by a department other than the department having responsibility for the asset. In the event of a loan, the department will complete a fixed asset transaction document (Form 02) and forward it to the accounting division prior to physical movement of the fixed asset. In the event of a loan, the loaner department or division will remain on the fixed asset record system. The loanee department or division will be listed in the location and building code sections on the fixed asset record system.
The permanent movement of an asset between departments or divisions is reported by the completion of a fixed asset transaction document (Form 02). The form is completed and forwarded to the accounting division before the asset is physically moved.
Requests for the physical movement of fixed assets in the event of transfer are the responsibility of the department.
(Mo. of 12-10-01)
Sec. 2-184. - Disposals of fixed assets.
(a)
The board of commissioners of Whitfield County prior to disposal must approve all disposals of fixed assets. After approval a fixed asset disposition document (Form 01) is completed and forwarded to the accounting division by the department. Once the assets are sold, the disposal is entered on the fixed asset record system.
(b)
Fixed assets may be disposed in [the following] six ways:
(1)
Auction. This is defined as the sale of surplus or obsolete assets that have been inspected by other department/divisions for possible use and are now being held for sale in the surplus warehouse. This is the most common method used for disposal of Whitfield County fixed assets. The accounting division removes fixed asset tags prior to sale, prepares a revenue allocation worksheet by fund, and disposes sold assets on the fixed asset record system. To dispose of assets sold at auction on the fixed asset record system, the accounting division uses the auction list previously approved by the commission. This serves as authorization to remove the assets from the record system. The accounting division may need to count assets in surplus after auction for verification. The internal auditor is notified if this need arises.
(2)
Stolen. This is defined as fixed assets removed from a location without permission.
(3)
Donations. This is defined as donations of assets to other person or agencies. A copy of the minutes of the board of commissioners meeting approving the donation of Whitfield County fixed assets is required.
(4)
Sale other than auctions. This is defined as an individual sale other than auction of fixed assets. For example, the sale of a piece of equipment to another government agency. The accounting division is notified prior to the sale. The board of commissioners approval is required.
(5)
Dismantling. This is defined as the breakdown of fixed assets for alternate use. For example, a lawnmower is dismantled for parts. The accounting division is notified prior to the dismantling.
(6)
Trade-in. This is defined as assets traded for other assets. Since the trade-in is equal to the disposition of a fixed asset, the board of commissioners approval is required. The accounting division is notified prior to the trade-in.
For accounting purposes, the newly acquired asset is to be recorded at the cost without allowance for trade-in.
(Mo. of 12-10-01)
Sec. 2-185. - Physical inventory.
A physical inventory of fixed assets is conducted annually by the internal auditor. The scope of the inventory is determined by the internal auditor and is subject to change with each audit. All fixed assets are subject to audit. Assets being held in surplus are also subject to audit during this process.
Once the physical inventory is complete, internal audit will issue a report detailing the findings and recommendations of the audit. The accounting division is responsible for implementing the recommendations and answering the findings of the physical inventory if possible.
(Mo. of 12-10-01)
Sec. 2-186. - Sensitive assets.
Sensitive assets are those assets that may not meet the fixed asset criteria but need to be included on fixed asset records. The need for inclusion is based on the sensitive, portable or theft prone nature of the asset. These assets are not recorded on the fixed asset record system, but are maintained at the department level. They are given an unserialized tag with the heading "Property of Whitfield County". They include radios, electronic equipment and printers.
For this purpose, radios are defined as public safety radio equipment. Desktop radios are not included. Electronic equipment is defined as television sets, video cassette recorders, and cameras. Printers are defined as computer related printers.
(Mo. of 12-10-01)
Sec. 2-187. - Items not considered fixed assets.
There are items that meet fixed asset criteria that are not recorded on the fixed asset record system. The inclusion of these items creates inaccuracy and does not contribute to the overall purpose of fixed asset record keeping as outlined on page 1 of the fixed assets record keeping manual [on file in the county clerks office]. The items that fall into this category are as follows:
(1)
Light bars.
(2)
Traffic lights.
(3)
Computer software.
(4)
Infrastructure.
(5)
Inventory parts.
(6)
Repair and maintenance items.
Light bars refer to the lighting systems for public safety vehicles. Computer software refers to mainframe software, server software, personal computer software, or any other software that will remain in the permanent custody Whitfield County Information Technology Department. Inventory parts refer to parts inventories maintained by public works and fire department. These inventories are considered consumable.
