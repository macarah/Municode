(b)
Applicability. Applicable to any interruptible user for any purpose exclusive of resale and for service at any one location through one metering point from lines of adequate capacity. Service under this rate schedule is dependent upon the city's having the natural gas supply and capacity in excess of the existing requirements of higher priority customers. A customer without the ability to switch to an alternate fuel during periods when service must be interrupted, in order to maintain service to the city's higher priority customers, must either curtail its consumption of natural gas or be a subscriber to standby service. A customer under this rate schedule is required to execute a separate service agreement with the city.
(c)
Monthly rate. The monthly charges for this service inside the city and outside the city shall consist of a fixed base service charge plus a volumetric rate, as follows:
(1)
Base service charge. Each customer, regardless of the amount of gas consumed or purchased, and even if no gas is consumed or purchased, shall pay a service charge in an amount as established from time to time by city council resolution.

a.
Calculation. In general, the interruptible volumetric rate is determined monthly according to the rate calculation that all volumes consumed shall be charged at a rate per Mcf, which is the sum of the following components:
1.
Underlying commodity charge. The first of the month Spot Market Index Price for gas delivered into Transco (50 percent of zone 3 price plus 50 percent of zone 4 price), as posted in "Inside FERC's Gas Market Report;"
2.
Fuel recovery charge. Applicable fuel retention factor as posted in Transco's FERC approved tariff;
3.
Interstate pipeline transportation charge. The currently effective market rate for interruptible transportation on Transco's interstate pipeline system; plus
b.
City distribution charge.

(f)
Unauthorized use of gas. The city shall have the right at any time, following a one-hour notice, to interrupt or limit the quantity of gas it delivers to a customer under this rate schedule. If a customer refuses to honor the limitation notice, the customer shall pay all pipeline penalty charges incurred by the city for gas consumed, plus the cost of gas. The payment of a penalty charge shall not, under any circumstances, be considered as giving the customer the right to take unauthorized gas.
(g)
Emergency gas. If a customer finds it impossible to continue operations on standby fuel because of a bona fide emergency during a limitation period, the city may at its sole discretion furnish emergency gas service, upon request, out of its storage or peak shaving facilities. The customer shall pay an amount as established from time to time by city council resolution multiplied by each Mcf delivered under emergency service, plus the cost of gas delivered. The city may discontinue this service at any time.
(h)
Standby service. Interruptible customers without operational alternate fuel systems, and without the ability to curtail natural gas consumption when ordered by the city, may purchase seasonal firm capacity for each month, November through March. The standby service charge will be in addition to all rate components stated in subsection (c) of this section, and will generally be calculated as follows:
The total standby service charge will equal the daily firm Mcf requirement of the customer multiplied by the market price of firm capacity/Mcf multiplied by five (the number of winter months November through March). The specific terms and conditions associated with this service will be established through a separate service agreement, which may vary from the general terms and conditions described in this article.
(i)
Delivered gas service. Interruptible customers without operational alternate fuel systems, and without the ability to curtail natural gas consumption when ordered by the city, but which do not want to purchase standby service, can elect to purchase a delivered gas service. If a service is available at the time, the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia will complete this transaction on behalf of the customer. The customer will be required to pay for all costs associated with the delivered gas service in addition to the city distribution charges listed in subsection (c)(2)b of this section for the gas. This service is available at the city's sole discretion, and may be cancelled at any time.
(j)
Alternate fuel discount. In the event a customer desires to burn an alternate fuel in lieu of natural gas, the city may at its sole discretion discount the delivery charge stated in subsection (i) of this section. The customer must contact the city and provide adequate proof that the delivered price of its alternate fuel is less than the total monthly charge calculated in accordance with the rate structure contained in subsection (c) of this section and that natural gas consumption will be reduced if a discount is not offered.
