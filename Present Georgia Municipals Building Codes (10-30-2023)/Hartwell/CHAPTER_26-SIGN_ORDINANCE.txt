--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2017-02, adopted Aug.7, 2017, repealed Ch. 26 in its entirety and enacted a new Ch. 26 to read as set out herein. Former Ch. 26, §§ 26-1—26-3, 26-25—26-28, 26-60—26-67, 26-93—26-96, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the Code 1989, §§ 14.5-1—14.5-11, 14.5-22, 14.5-31—14.5-34, 14.5-41—14.5-44; Ord. adopted Oct. 2, 1989, §§ I—X; Ord. adopted May 1, 1990; Ord. adopted Jan. 3, 1995; Ord. adopted March 13, 1995.

Sec. 26-1. - Purpose.
Regulation of the location, size, placement, maintenance and certain other features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural and historic environment, and to protect property values therein. Accordingly, it is the intention of the city to establish regulations governing the display of signs which will:
Protect property values, the local economy, and the quality of life by preserving and enhancing the appearance of the streetscape, which affects the image of the city.
Promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the public.
Promote the use of signs which are aesthetically pleasing and of appropriate scale in order to protect the character of Hartwell's historic residential and commercial districts.
Restrict the clutter from excessive signs and lights which in turn promotes the free flow of traffic, and protects pedestrians and motorist from injury and property damage caused by, or which may be partially attributable to cluttered, distracting, and or illegal signage.
Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings.
As these or any regulations can only establish the mechanical limits of signs and not enforce a level of visual quality in sign design, anyone planning a sign is strongly encouraged to consider:
The character of the proposed sign, the audience for which the sign is to be designed, and the area where the sign will be located. The applicant is urged to think not only of the sign in and of itself, but also in terms of the effects such a sign will have upon the character of the surrounding area.
The character of the sign structure, that is, the physical means of supporting the sign, and whether that structure could be made an integral part of a sign rather than a separate and frequently distracting element.
To avoid illegal signage, anyone contemplating a sign is encouraged to contact the Building Official of the City of Hartwell, the Hartwell Downtown Development Authority, or a private firm or individual engaged in sign/graphic design for advice or assistance in the planning of such signage. For those contemplating signage within the historic district, the City of Hartwell Historic Preservation Commission may also provide guidance on the signage design requirements.
(Ord. No. 2017-02, 8-7-2017)
Sec. 26-2. - Boundaries.
For the purpose of these regulations, the city is divided into two sign districts: sign district I and sign district II.

The building official shall only issue a permit for the erection or alteration of a sign which meets the requirements of these regulations and applicable sections of the building code and electrical code.
(c)
Certificate of appropriateness. Prior to the issuance of a sign permit for locations in district I, applicants shall first obtain approval from the City of Hartwell Historic Preservation Commission (HHPC) by submitting an application for certificate of appropriateness (COA). The building official shall therefore not issue a permit for the erection or alteration of a sign in sign district I until the submitted COA application is granted.
(d)
Filing procedure. Applicants wishing to obtain a permit to erect, display, construct, place, hang, alter or change a sign not exempt in section 26-6 or section 26-7 shall first make application with the building official. Upon application, the applicant shall provide necessary information as required by the building official, including but not limited to:
(1)
The type of sign(s) as defined in this chapter.
(2)
The names, addresses and contact information for the owners and occupants.
(3)
A site plan showing the specific location of the existing sign and/or the proposed sign(s) on the applicable site, relative to the property line(s), right(s)-of-way, and building(s).
(4)
A photograph or detailed sketch depicting the existing and/or proposed sign(s), showing all text and graphics.
(5)
The number of proposed sign faces.
(6)
The dimensions of the existing and/or proposed sign(s), including the height and square footage per sign face.
(7)
Structural details including, but not limited to, foundations or other means of securing signs or sign structures to the ground or details on the means of attachment to buildings of other structures.
(8)
The sign material to be used.
(9)
Desired lighting if any, including internal or external lighting, the number and wattage of lighting, and type of illumination, i.e., incandescent, fluorescent, neon, etc.
(10)
Other information as may be required for proper issuance by the building official.
(e)
Expiration. Every sign permit issued shall become invalid unless the work on the sign authorized by such sign permit is commenced within 180 days after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such sign permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 180 days after the time the work is commenced.
(f)
Suspension or revocation. The building official is authorized to suspend or revoke a sign permit issued under the provisions of the sign ordinance wherever the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete information, or in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of the sign ordinance.
(g)
Permit fees. A permit shall not be valid until the fees prescribed by this chapter have been paid, nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, has been paid.
(h)
Schedule of permit fees. On signs requiring a permit, a fee for each permit shall be paid as required, in accordance with the fee schedule established in section 26-16.
(i)
Work commencing before permit issuance. Any person who erects, installs, constructs, displays, alters or changes any sign requiring a permit by this chapter before obtaining the necessary permit shall be subject to a penalty of 100 percent of the total sign permit fee in addition to the usual permit fee.
(Ord. No. 2017-02, 8-7-2017)
Sec. 26-10. - Sign measurements and placements.
(a)
Sign height. The height of a sign shall be measured from the average natural grade at the base of the sign to the highest point of the sign face or structure, whichever is highest. The height shall not be measured from the top of an earth berm, support beam, or planting box. The ground level shall be the lower of the ground level existing at the time of construction or the ground level existing prior to construction or any earth disturbance at the site. No person shall artificially increase the maximum height of a sign by altering the grade at the base of the sign.
(b)
Sign clearances. The sign clearance shall be measured from the bottom of the sign at any point, being the sign or the sign structure, whichever is lowest, vertically to the ground below.
(c)
Sign face area. The sign face area shall be measured as described for each sign below:
(1)
Monument signs. Monument signs shall be measured to the outside edge of the monument structure, from top to ground on signs with solid bases. Monument signs supported with columns shall be measured horizontally to the outer edges of the columns, and vertically from the upper edge of the sign face to the lower edge of the sign face.
(2)
Sign cabinets. The area of sign faces enclosed in frames or cabinets is determined based on the outer dimensions of the frame or cabinet surrounding the sign face.
(3)
Multiple cabinets. For freestanding and projecting signs that contain multiple cabinets on one structure and are oriented in the same viewing direction, the modules together are counted as one sign face.
(4)
Individual element signs. When signs are constructed of individual elements or use individual painted or attached text, characters or symbols, as opposed to the sign text being on a sign cabinet or having a defined border, the sign area is determined by calculating the area of an imaginary rectangle drawn around the sign elements.
(5)
Round signs (ball shaped). The maximum surface area visible at any one time of a round, three-dimensional, or three-sided or more sign is counted to determine sign area.
(6)
Signs on a base material. When a sign is on a base material and attached without a frame, such as a wood board or Plexiglas panel, the dimensions of the base materials are to be used.
(7)
Awnings and marquees. When signs are incorporated into awnings, the sign area is determined by computing the area of an imaginary rectangle drawn around the sign face.
(8)
Asymmetrical, elliptical or irregular-shaped signs. The area shall be measured by drawing an imaginary rectangle around the total sign or sign elements as illustrated in figure 10.3.8.
Figure 10.3.8
(9)
Circular. The allowed area of a sign shaped as a perfect circle shall be determined by using the formula: A = π × r 2 (π = 3.14) A = area r-radius: figure 10.3.9.
Figure 10.3.9
(10)
Projecting signs. Projecting signs can project over a public right-of-way but no closer than two feet from a curbline and shall have a minimum clearance of nine feet of the finish grade of a sidewalk and 15 feet above any road, driveway or alley. No projecting sign or supporting structure shall extend above the top of a parapet wall.
(11)
Backed (two-sided) signs. When the faces of a backed (two-sided) sign are parallel, or within ten degrees of parallel, only one side of the sign shall be counted for allowable signage. If the sign faces are not parallel, each is considered to be a separate sign face, and both faces are counted. See figure 10.3.11.
Figure 10.3.11
(d)
Allowable sign placement. Certain signage shall be allowed for primary building walls (PBW) and secondary building walls (SBW) as specified in figure 10.4. The PBWs and SBWs are determined as follows:
(1)
Primary building walls (PBW). The PBWs are those exterior walls of a structure which are oriented with most street frontage (visibility from the public right-of-way). PBWs can also include the exterior wall of a structure which does not necessarily have street frontage but which contains a public entrance and faces a parking area on site. Structures located on corner lots may have PBWs designated for each street front.
(2)
Secondary building walls (SBW). The SBWs are those walls of a building that are not PBWs.

(Ord. No. 2017-02, 8-7-2017)
Sec. 26-12. - Nonconforming signs.
(a)
Any sign, banner or other display included in the provisions of this chapter, existing at the time of enactment of or subsequent amendment of this chapter, that is not in conformity with its provisions and regulations shall be considered a nonconforming sign.
(b)
Nonconforming temporary signs made of paper, cloth, or other nondurable material, other than those permitted herein, and any sign that is not permanently anchored to the ground or affixed to a building or are located within a public right-of-way shall be removed within 14 days of the effective date of this chapter.
(c)
Existing non-temporary, nonconforming signs shall not be:
(1)
Changed to or replaced with another nonconforming sign. This provision shall allow a change in copy or graphics on the sign face only if the occupant or tenant is unchanged. Changes to copy or graphics on nonconforming signs for different occupants or tenants shall be prohibited. Furthermore, the copy or graphics may be changed on the sign face of a group development sign, provided the change maintains or establishes consistent color and design of the overall sign.
(2)
Torn down and rebuilt as a nonconforming sign;
(3)
Extended or enlarged except in conformity with these regulations.
(4)
Structurally altered so as to extend useful life.
(5)
Relocated.
(d)
Repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs shall be permitted. However, no structural repairs or maintenance shall be permitted which would change the size, shape, area, or location, except in compliance with the provisions and requirements of this chapter. Furthermore, no repairs in excess of 50 percent of the replacement value of the sign structure shall be permitted. If the repairs are in excess of 50 percent of the replacement value the sign shall be removed as required by section 26-4 of this chapter.
(e)
Nonconforming signs shall not be continued upon the change of ownership of the business located on the property or upon change of the tenant or occupancy of the property. A nonconforming sign will not be affected by a change of ownership of the building when the tenant or business does not change.
(Ord. No. 2017-02, 8-7-2017)
Sec. 26-13. - Enforcement.
(a)
Authorization to enforce. The building official is hereby authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of the sign ordinance, otherwise referred to herein as this chapter. The building official shall have the authority to render interpretations of this chapter and to adopt policies and procedures in order to clarify the application of its provisions.

The notice and order shall specify a reasonable time for the correction of violation. Except as otherwise specified in section 26-13, the building official will require the correction, removal, abatement, or remedy of the violation within 30 days of receipt of the notice and order. Such notice and order shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof is delivered personally, sent by certified or first-class mail to the last known address, or a copy of the notice and order is affixed at a conspicuous location at the front entrance of a business or location, or attached to the sign itself.
(i)
Immediate removal or correction required. In addition to other remedies, the building official is authorized to require the immediate removal or the immediate correction of violations, or shall have the authority to remove or correct any violations, or cause such work to be done for:
