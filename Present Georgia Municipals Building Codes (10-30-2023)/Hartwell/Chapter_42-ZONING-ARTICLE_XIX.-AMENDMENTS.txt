Sec. 42-530. - Same—Variances.
The city is hereby empowered to authorize upon application in specific cases such variance from the dimensional requirements of zoning regulations (any provisions requiring a number to be achieved, such as height in feet, setback, lot area, lot width, parking and loading requirements, etc.) as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The existence of permitted or nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings or structures in the same zoning district or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance. A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship, after appropriate application in accordance with section 42-526, upon specific findings that all of the following conditions exist. The absence of any one condition shall be grounds for denial of the application for variance.
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same district;
(2)
A literal interpretation of the provisions of these zoning regulations would create an unnecessary hardship and would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners within the district in which the property is located;
(3)
Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located;
(4)
Relief, if granted, will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or general welfare in such a manner as will interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonable affect their value;
(5)
The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant;
(6)
The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure;
(7)
The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, building or structures that is not permitted by right in the district involved; and
(8)
A variance shall not be granted in cases where the requested relief to the property owner can be remedied by a change to a zoning district which otherwise would not require a variance.
(Ord. of 10-2-1995, § 86-1909)
Sec. 42-531. - Procedures for appeals.
(a)
The city council is empowered to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the zoning administrator in the interpretation or enforcement of these zoning regulations.
(b)
Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days, or as provided by city rules, by filing with the zoning administrator a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. All papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken shall forthwith be transmitted to the city.
(c)
The city council shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the appeal and give at least 15 days of public notice thereof and due notice to the parties in interest and shall render a decision on the appeal within a reasonable time.
(d)
This section shall not be construed as permitting an appeal of the city's denial of a rezoning request or conditional use, the appropriate remedy of which would be a suit filed in the county superior court.
(Ord. of 10-2-1995, § 86-1910)
Sec. 42-532. - Simultaneous consideration of multiple applications.
A petitioner may simultaneously submit multiple applications involving the same property, such as a rezoning request, conditional use, and variance. The planning commission and city council may simultaneously hear and consider multiple applications, provided the applicable public notice and other specified requirements are met. The proper order of consideration of multiple applications shall be the rezoning request first, conditional use second and variance third. The city council may consider and act upon a variance request at the same meeting as a rezoning request and/or conditional use is approved, in accordance with section 42-530. For multiple applications, specified filing fees shall be paid for each individual application, to defray the cost of newspaper advertisements and posting of signs on the subject property.
(Ord. of 10-2-1995, § 86-1911)
Sec. 42-533. - Conditional approval permitted.
(a)
The letter of intent, site plan, and other information submitted as a part of any approved application for zoning map amendment, variance, appeal or conditional use, as well as any statements of intent made by the petitioner in public meetings recorded in the minutes of the body considering the application, shall be considered a part of the approval and must be followed.
(b)
In addition to the conditions of following the submitted site plan, letter of intent and other assurances made by the petitioner, the planning commission may recommend, and the city council may attach, any conditions to its approval which it finds necessary to render the proposed development compatible with adjacent and nearby properties and land uses.
(c)
Applications to modify the approved site plan, letter of intent or other conditions of approval may be considered by the city after review and recommendation by the planning commission, without the requirement of any public hearings. Any request, however, which in the zoning administrator's opinion constitutes a change that is tantamount to a new application that would otherwise require a rezoning, new conditional use or variance to articles and sections of this chapter not previously contemplated shall require resubmittal and reconsideration of the request as a new application that meets all submittal, notification and public hearing requirements specified in this chapter.
(Ord. of 10-2-1995, § 86-1912)

Upon receipt of a completed application, fees and other information required by this chapter, the zoning administrator shall cause notice of such application to be published at least one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the city council at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of public hearing before the city. Said published notice shall include, as a minimum, the purpose, location, date and time of the public hearing before the planning commission and city council, the location of the property being considered, the present zoning classification of the property, and proposed action to be taken, as appropriate (such as proposed zoning district, type of conditional use, variance to particular articles and sections, and so forth). The zoning administrator shall also cause to have posted in a conspicuous place on said property one or more signs, each of which shall contain the information specified for published notices. The public hearing before the planning commission and the city shall not take place until said signs have been posted for a least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the public hearing. The posting of signs shall not be required for appeals, since an appeal only applies to interpretation of zoning regulations that apply to all similarly situated properties. The city shall not require the posting of signs when adopting or readopting a zoning chapter and official zoning map.
(c)
Public hearings may be delayed, rescheduled or continued at another time and date, provided announcement is given at the time and place of the initially scheduled and advertised public hearing, and provided such date, time and location of the public hearing to be delayed, rescheduled or continued is announced.

(b)
After completing its studies of the particular petition, the planning commission shall submit a recommended action in writing to the city council. The planning commission may submit any additional report it deems appropriate. The planning commission's recommendation shall have an advisory effect only and shall not be binding on the city. Copies of the planning commission's recommendation and report shall be made available upon request to the applicant and other interested parties upon completion and distribution to the city council and at the public hearing before the city.
(c)
The planning commission shall have 30 days within which to submit its recommendation. The city council shall not take action on any of said applications, until it has received the planning commission's recommendation within the specified time period; provided, however, that this shall not be construed to limit the city council from conducting its scheduled public hearing on the matter, should it desire to do so.
