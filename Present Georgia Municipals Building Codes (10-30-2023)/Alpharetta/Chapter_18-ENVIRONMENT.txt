Sec. 18-19. - Definitions.
The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection Area, also referred to as the protection area, means the stream channel and the land area extending outward 35 horizontal feet from the banks on either side of all flowing streams in the drainage basins of all tributaries of the Chattahoochee River which enter the Chattahoochee River downstream from Buford Dam and upstream from Peachtree Creek, except for such land within the Chattahoochee Corridor, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-5-441.
Flowing stream means any stream which is designated and shown as a permanent stream on the 7 5/10-minute quadrangle maps of the U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, plus any stream which the city council may determine to be, and designate as, a flowing stream.
Land disturbing activity means scraping, plowing, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting, or filling of land or placement of any structure or impervious surface, dam, obstruction, or deposit.
Parcel means any plot, lot or acreage shown correctly as a unit on the latest county tax assessment records.
Watershed means the land area which drains into a particular stream.
(Code 1989, § 5-118; Ord. No. 204-B, § 4, 1-28-1985)
Sec. 18-20. - Statutory authorization.
This article is adopted pursuant to the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-453.
(Code 1989, § 5-119; Ord. No. 204-B, § 2.0, 1-28-1985)
Sec. 18-21. - Finding.
The city council finds that:
(1)
The Chattahoochee River provides multiple public benefits, which include use of the river as the primary water supply for metropolitan Atlanta.
(2)
The water quality of the Chattahoochee River depends upon the water quality of the flowing streams tributary to the river.
(3)
Sediment and other polluting materials and conditions, including, but not limited to, pesticides, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous, toxic materials, and elevations in water temperature are harmful to the water quality of the river and its tributaries.
(4)
The riparian vegetation along these watercourses helps preserve water quality. Dense tree growth helps to prevent stream bank erosion, and streamside vegetation reduces the amount of sediment and other polluting materials that would otherwise wash into streams. Riparian trees, by shading, help maintain cooler water temperatures and thus enhance water quality.
(Code 1989, § 5-120; Ord. No. 204-B, § 3.1, 1-28-1985)
Sec. 18-22. - Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to minimize public and private losses due to erosion, siltation, and water pollution; and to maintain stream water quality in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Create vegetative buffer areas adjacent to tributary streams in the drainage area of the Chattahoochee Corridor.
(2)
Minimize land disturbing activities within such buffer areas by requiring issuance of a permit for such activities.

Within ten days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the director of public works to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability, or water quality of the protection area.

The land disturbing activity is for the purpose of constructing one of the following: a stream crossing by a driveway, a dam and/or impoundment; a detention, retention, or sediment control pond or facility; a transportation route or public utility line when, due to natural conditions in an area, such construction would be less harmful to the environment than if it were located outside the protection area;
(2)
The land disturbing activity is within a right-of-way of any public agency pursuant to a permit issued by such public agency; or
(3)
The director of public works finds and determines that a minimum amount of land disturbance necessary for the beneficial use of the parcel has been proposed.

Conditions. In each permit issued under the provisions of this article, the director of public works shall include conditions designed to:

Limit erosion, sedimentation, and water pollution within the protection zone to amounts and rates not greater than those occurring before the land disturbing activity; and

Preserve, protect, or replace the maximum feasible amount of natural vegetation.

A permit which has become void may be renewed at the discretion of the director of public works.
