State Law reference— Establishment, maintenance, or use of building, structure, or place for unlawful sexual purposes, O.C.G.A. § 41-3-1; prohibited conduct, O.C.G.A. § 3-3-41; governing authority has power to enact legislation to restrict operation of adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, and adult movie houses to areas zoned for commercial or industrial purposes, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 10-54. - Findings; public purpose.
The mayor and city council find that public nudity (either partial or total) in so-called nude bars or establishments offering so-called nude entertainment or adult entertainment, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. This finding is based upon the experiences of other communities and municipalities, and upon the evidence and testimony of citizens and experts who have appeared before the mayor and council. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with such establishments are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with such establishments are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditures for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Accordingly, it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to enact regulations to reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. However, the mayor and council also find that the outright prohibition of such establishments could improperly infringe upon protected forms of expression. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to reasonably regulate adult entertainment establishments in a manner that serves the legitimate governmental interest of reducing criminal activity and protecting property values without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and their patrons.

Sec. 10-97. - Non-transferable.
No adult entertainment establishment license may be sold, transferred or assigned by a licensee, or by operation of law, to any other person. Any such sale, transfer or assignment, or attempted sale, transfer or assignment, shall be deemed to constitute a voluntary surrender of such license, and such license shall thereafter be null and void; provided and excepting, however, that if the licensee is a partnership and one or more of the partners should die, one or more of the surviving partners may acquire, by purchase or otherwise, the interest of the deceased partner without effecting a surrender or termination of such license, and in such case, the license, upon notification to the city, shall be placed in the name of the surviving partner. An adult entertainment establishment license issued to a corporation shall be deemed terminated and void when either any outstanding stock of the corporation is sold, transferred or assigned after the issuance of a license, or any stock not issued at the time of the granting of a license is thereafter issued.

The city clerk shall be authorized to suspend or revoke a license in the event of any one or more of the following:
(1)
A licensee gave false or misleading information in the original application or renewal process;
(2)
A licensee has knowingly allowed possession, use, or sale of controlled substances on the premises, or the licensee did not make a reasonable effort to prevent any such occurrence;

A licensee has violated any provision of this article;
(5)
A licensee has been convicted of any drug-related, alcohol-related or sex-related crime by the state or the city regarding an offense which was committed on the premises or which would otherwise violate the provisions of this article; and
(6)
A licensee fails to pay any fee, license fee, fine or other amount of money due to the city under this article or any other licensing ordinance of the city.
(c)
In the event that the city clerk determines that a license violation has occurred, such license shall be suspended for ten days for the first violation. For a second violation occurring within any consecutive 12-month period, the license shall be suspended for 30 days. For a third violation occurring within any consecutive 12-month period, the license shall be suspended for 90 days. Any license that has been suspended three or more times in any consecutive 12-month period shall be revoked. In addition, any licensee found to be in violation of section 10-56(d) and (f) shall be subject to immediate license revocation; provided, however, that the licensee shall be authorized to continue its business operations until the date of the hearing scheduled in accordance with subsection (e) hereafter. No licensee or any other applicant may apply for a license for the same premises during any period of suspension or revocation.
(d)
In the event of a suspension or revocation by the city clerk, the licensee may appeal the decision of the city clerk to the mayor and city council by filing a written notice of appeal with the city clerk within ten days from the date of the effective date of the written notice received by the licensee in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a memorandum or other writing setting out fully the grounds for such appeal and all arguments in support thereof. The city clerk may submit a memorandum in response to the memorandum filed by the licensee on appeal to the city council. The city clerk's decision shall be final unless an appeal is timely filed. An appeal shall stay the city clerk's decision until the appeal is heard or withdrawn. The clerk shall place the appeal on the agenda of the next regular council meeting occurring not less than five nor more than 30 days after receipt of the appeal.
(e)
When an appeal is placed on the council agenda, the council may take either of the following actions:
(1)
Set a hearing date before the city council and instruct the city clerk to give such notice of hearing as may be required by law; or
(2)
Appoint a hearing officer and fix the time and place for hearing. The hearing officer may or may not be a city employee, and may be appointed for an extended period of time. The clerk shall assume responsibility for such publication of notice of the hearing as may be required by law. If a hearing officer is appointed, the hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set out in this article.
In either event, the hearing shall be held within 30 days of the council's action, unless a continuance of such date is agreed to by the licensee and the city clerk.
(f)
At any hearing, the hearing officer or the city council (if it elects not to appoint a hearing officer) shall receive oral and written testimony regarding the appeal. Hearings shall be conducted under rules issued by the hearing officer or city council, which shall be consistent with rules applied in administrative proceedings, and shall ensure that each party may present evidence, cross-examine witnesses and be represented by legal counsel.
(g)
If the hearing is held before the city council, the city council may sustain, overrule or modify the action of the city clerk. The decision of the mayor and city council shall be final. Appeals from the decision of the mayor and city council shall be to the county superior court filed within 30 days of the final action of the mayor and city council.
(h)
If the hearing is held before the hearing officer, the hearing officer shall, within a reasonable time not to exceed 15 days from the date such hearing is terminated, submit a written report to the council. Such report shall contain a brief summary of the evidence considered and state findings, conclusions and a recommendation. The report may recommend that the council sustain, overrule or modify the action of the city clerk. All such reports shall be filed with the city clerk, and shall be considered public records. A copy of such report shall be forwarded by certified mail to the appellant the same day it is filed with the city clerk, with additional copies furnished to the city administrator and chief of police. The city clerk shall place the hearing officer's report on the agenda of the next regular council meeting occurring not less than ten days after the report is filed and shall notify the appellant of the date of such meeting at least ten days prior to the meeting, unless the appellant stipulates to a shorter notice period.
(i)
The council may adopt or reject the hearing officer's decision in its entirety or may modify the proposed recommendation. The council shall base its determination on the hearing officer's report and other evidence in the record. No additional evidence or arguments shall be permitted at the council meeting. If the council does not adopt the hearing officer's recommendation, it may:
(1)
Refer the matter to the same or another hearing officer for a de novo hearing, or for the taking of additional evidence on specific points, and in either of such cases, the hearing officer shall proceed as provided in this article.
(2)
Decide the case upon a review of the entire record before the hearing officer with or without taking additional evidence.
