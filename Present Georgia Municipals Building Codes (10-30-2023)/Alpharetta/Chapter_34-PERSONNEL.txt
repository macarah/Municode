It is the policy of the city that the abuse of alcohol and drugs by public employees is detrimental to the health, safety and morals of the public. The purpose of this article is to establish reasonable standards and procedures for drug and alcohol testing of city employees and applicants for city employment. The city council also recognizes that individuals have certain rights to privacy and dignity. In adopting this article, the city council has attempted to balance the city's interest in protecting the health and safety of its employees and the public with the employees' legitimate expectations of privacy. Accordingly, certain procedural safeguards, limitations and due process guarantees are set forth in connection with the testing required by this article.

A work-related accident;

The city administrator and chief of police are hereby directed to develop procedures for uniform random drug and alcohol testing of all employees in these positions.

The employee must make a written request for a hearing to the appropriate department head or designee within three days of receipt by the employee of the confirmation test results.
