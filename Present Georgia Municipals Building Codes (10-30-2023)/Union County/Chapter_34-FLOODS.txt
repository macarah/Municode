The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common loadbearing wall other than a fire wall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a fire wall or is separated by an independent perimeter loadbearing wall shall be considered new construction.
Appeal means a request for a review of the commissioner's interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate and where velocity flow may be evident.
Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community which is subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those areas designated by the local community and as set forth in section 34-37.
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
Basement means the portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
Building means any structure which is built for support, shelter or enclosure for any occupancy or storage.
Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations or permanent storage of materials or equipment.
Elevated building means a nonbasement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event.
Existing construction means any structure for which the start of construction commenced before September 15, 1993.
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before September 15, 1993.
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads.
Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the:
(1)
Overflow of inland or tidal waters; or
(2)
Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.

Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
Flood insurance study means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration which evaluates flood hazards and contains flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood.
Floodplain means any land area which is susceptible to flooding.
Floodproofing means the modification of individual structures and facilities, their sites, and their contents to protect against structural failure, to keep water out, or to reduce effects of water entry.
Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building.
Historic structure means any structure that is:
(1)
Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register of Historic Places;

The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any requirement of this chapter.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home or a gas or liquid storage tank.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or improvements to a building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building prior to the improvement. The market value of the building should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement or, in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include improvements to a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, which have been preidentified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before such repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2
Sec. 34-33. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damage, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Ord. No. O-2000-002, art. 1, § B, 2-22-2000)
Sec. 34-34. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(5)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Ord. No. O-2000-002, art. 1, § C, 2-22-2000)
Sec. 34-35. - Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter shall include the following:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(3)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
(4)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(5)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

ARTICLE IV. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION

Sec. 34-101. - General standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard within the county the following provisions shall be required:
(1)
New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
(2)
New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
(3)
New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
(4)
All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
a.
Designs for complying with the requirement of this subsection must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
1.
Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
2.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
3.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided, they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions.
b.
So as not to violate the lowest floor requirements of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for the parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises or entry to the elevated area.
c.
The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
(5)
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within such components during conditions of flooding;
(6)
Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces;
(7)
New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
(8)
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters;
(9)
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and
(10)
Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
(Ord. No. O-2000-002, art. 4, § A, 2-22-2000)
Sec. 34-102. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard within the county the following provisions shall be required:
(1)
New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data is available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. If solid foundation perimeter walls are used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards set forth in section 34-101(4).
(2)
Nonresidential construction. New construction, or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components shall have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection, and the engineer or architect shall provide such certification to the floodplain administrator.
(3)
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data is available:
a.
All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on individual lots or parcels, in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions or on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
b.
Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either the:
1.
Lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
2.
Manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers, or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
c.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (See subsection 34-101(6)).
d.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must:
1.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
2.
Meet all the requirements for new construction set forth in this chapter, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections 34-102(3)a.—c.
(4)
Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard as established in section 34-37 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided, it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification of such analyses.
b.
If the requirement set forth in subsection (4)a. of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

Sec. 34-103. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways (A zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-37, where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided (A zones), or where base flood data has been provided, but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
When base flood elevation data or floodway data has not been provided in accordance with section 34-37, then the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source in order to administer the provisions of this article. If data is not available from such sources, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream, or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
b.
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement, elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards set forth in subsection 34-101(4). Building sites which are filled and compacted, and which thereby create a building pad which is three feet above the highest adjacent grade, and which have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement, elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade are acceptable under the terms of this subsection. The floodplain administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(Ord. No. O-2000-002, art. 4, § C, 2-22-2000; Amd. of 7-21-2005)
Sec. 34-104. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones).
Areas of special flood hazard as established in section 34-37 may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. Such areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply to such areas:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards set forth in subsection 34-101(4). The floodplain administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(2)
New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection and shall provide such certification to the floodplain administrator.
(3)
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(Ord. No. O-2000-002, art. 4, § D, 2-22-2000)
Sec. 34-105. - Standards for subdivision proposals.
The following provisions shall apply to subdivision proposals:
(1)
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
(2)
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
(3)
All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
(4)
The boundaries of the 100-year floodplain and base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Such data shall be provided as a prerequisite to the issuance of either a land disturbing activity permit or a building permit.
For the purposes of this section, the term "subdivision" means any division of a tract of land greater than five lots or five acres, whichever is less, for the purpose of the sale of the lots, either individually, in blocks or as a whole. Any tract that is to be developed after the estate division will become subject to all applicable rules and regulations of this chapter, and must develop the base flood elevation data. This section shall not apply to the division of property into smaller lots for the purpose of distributing an estate among the heirs of the estate, or for the purpose of giving shares of a tract to family members for no compensation.
