Except as provided in the following section, every owner of an unsterilized dog, cat or ferret, is hereby required to confine the animal at all times. Confinement shall include keeping the animal within a fence, a proper enclosure, a house, other enclosure or structure that affords the animal humane care and in all cases prevents access to other animals not kept in the same enclosure. The use of electronic fences, tethers, runs and chains are not acceptable to confine an animal inasmuch as such methods allow access by other animals. Any time an unsterilized animal is not confined, the animal must be on a secure and sturdy leash while being walked by a responsible person. Any unsterilized animal that is unconfined or not on a leash shall be subject to citation, confiscation and impoundment, and, in addition to being subject to citation, the owner shall be required to have the animal sterilized within 30 days.

(a)
Any dog, cat or ferret, which is more than three months of age, within the jurisdiction of the commissioner must have a valid and current rabies vaccination which shall have been administered by a licensed veterinarian. The burden shall be on the owner to provide verifiable proof of vaccination to animal control. Animals being kept in a shelter shall be exempt from the requirement of a rabies vaccination for up to 30 days. The requirements of this subsection include the need for up-to-date revaccinations. An animal owner found in violation of this subsection shall be required to comply with this subsection within seven days, or the animal control officer is hereby authorized to impound the animal and have the animal vaccinated. Any animal impounded under this section shall not be released to the owner unless and until all of the requirements of this chapter are met.
(b)
An owner of an animal which bites or scratches a human being with force sufficient to break the integrity of the skin shall be subject to impoundment, and shall be subject to citation if found either in violation of the requirement to have a current rabies vaccination, or in violation of quarantine requirements, and may be further subject to additional requirements and penalties pursuant to other provisions of this chapter as well as all Georgia state quarantine requirements.
(c)
It is unlawful for anyone (other than a licensed veterinarian or animal control) to kill or release any animal under observation for rabies or suspected of having been exposed to rabies or any animal which has bitten a human being, or to remove such animal from the county without written permission from animal control and the director of public health.
(d)
All owners of animals vaccinated against rabies shall obtain and keep available for each animal owned a valid certificate of vaccination, along with a rabies tag indicating the year it was issued. For all dogs, the tag shall be securely fastened to the collar of the dog for which it was issued. It is assumed that any animal has not had a rabies vaccination if proof cannot be provided for the administration of such vaccination.
(e)
All dog owners are required to affix identification to their animals, either on the dog's collar or by other means such as microchip, and such identification shall be sufficient to trace or locate the dog's owner.
(f)
Any dog, cat or ferret that has been in an animal shelter is required to obtain a current rabies vaccination and be sterilized upon being released to its owner or released for adoption. If the dog, cat or ferret is less than three months of age, the animal shelter shall require the owner to fulfill the requirement of a rabies vaccination when the dog, cat or ferret attains the age of three months and present proof of such vaccination and sterilization to the shelter that released the dog, cat or ferret. Animal control or the shelter that released the animal is authorized to pick up the animal and have it vaccinated and/or sterilized, the additional cost of which shall be reimbursed by the owner. The owner shall be subject to a citation for failure to comply with an adoption agreement.
(Ord. of 9-18-2014(2))
Sec. 14-7. - Abandonment, cruelty, mistreatment and abuse.
modified
(a)
It shall be unlawful for any person to abandon or abuse, injure, neglect, torture, torment, maim, mutilate, beat, wound, poison or kill an animal, or to confine or tether an animal in an unsafe or non-humane manner, or to confine an animal without sufficient ventilation and protection from extreme temperatures. The allowance of any condition, or failure to provide any care, which shall endanger an animal's health shall constitute abuse. This shall also include having a number of animals that exceeds an owner's ability to provide proper care and shelter in the opinion of animal control or a licensed veterinarian, and failure to provide adequate food and water, failure to obtain needed veterinary care to relieve pain and suffering, failure to appropriately treat an animal for parasitic infestations, and failure to provide humane care.
(b)
It shall be unlawful for anyone to abandon any dog or other domesticated animal, owned by or in the possession, including temporary possession, of any person. Such abandonment shall include leaving or putting out any animal, whether the animal is healthy, sick, injured, or diseased, on any private or public property, or aiding or permitting such leaving or putting out. It shall be unlawful for anyone to abandon any dead animal on any private or public property, or to fail to bury or otherwise properly dispose of the carcass within 24 hours after an animal's death in accordance with applicable state and county health regulations.
(c)
An animal owner is required to provide proper housing for a domesticated animal (depending on the breed), which shall at a minimum for dogs and most domesticated animals consist of three sides, a roof, and a floor, constructed in such a way as to keep an animal protected from the elements and extreme temperatures, and be of such a size that the animal can enter, exit, stand, turn around, and sleep comfortably. An owner is required to provide adequate and sanitary food and water.
(d)
It is the policy of animal control that tethering or chaining a dog as a permanent means of confinement is an unsafe, unwise, and dangerous practice. In the event an owner uses a tether or chain to confine a dog, it shall be of sufficient construction as to not constitute abuse or a danger to the dog and shall allow the dog sufficient freedom to safely perform its necessary activities and functions in the judgment of animal control. Improper, inhumane, and unsafe tethering and chaining as a permanent means of confinement shall be considered animal cruelty.
(e)
It shall be unlawful and shall constitute animal cruelty to buy, trade, own, possess, keep, sell or train any animal with the intent that such animal shall be engaged in an exhibition of fighting; or to build, make, maintain or keep a pit, or allow a pit to be built, for the purpose of an exhibition of animal fighting; or, in any manner, to encourage, instigate, promote or assist in an exhibition of animal fighting; or charge admission, be an assistant, umpire or participant or be present as a spectator to any exhibition of animal fighting.
(f)
Upon a finding of extreme circumstances, animal control may immediately impound any abandoned, mistreated or abused animals as described in this section and shall deal with the animal in accordance with animal control regulations and the provisions of this chapter and state law.
(g)
A person who commits any offense of abandonment, cruelty, mistreatment or abuse as delineated in the above provisions shall be subject to a citation in addition to the criminal penalties imposed by O.C.G.A. § 16-12-4. The animal shall be immediately evaluated by a veterinarian and be impounded and handled in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 4-11-9.2—4-11-9.6.
(Ord. of 9-18-2014(2))
Sec. 14-8. - Impoundment, rescue, surrender.
modified

In the case of livestock and wild animals, whether dead or alive, animal control is also authorized to move the animals off of roads and highways and public and private property, where they may have escaped or wandered from an owner's property. Outside contractors may be used as needed, and an owner shall be liable for any such costs incurred by animal control. The animal control officer may, in addition to or in lieu of impoundment or moving an animal, issue a citation for violation of any applicable section of this chapter.
(b)
Subject to any limitations imposed by state law, an animal control officer or any law enforcement officer shall have the authority to rescue any animal that appears to be suffering from a serious medical emergency. The rescued animal may be provided with immediate veterinary care if the officer deems such care necessary to prevent physical pain, suffering, disability or death to the animal, or in extreme circumstances may authorize euthanasia of the animal. The animal's owner, if known, shall be responsible for all expenses incurred for the rescue, moving, euthanasia, burial or subsequent treatment of the animal.
(c)
Any animal impounded which is found to be diseased or injured and whose ownership is unknown or is relinquished in writing, or whose owner cannot be immediately contacted, may immediately be destroyed if in the opinion of a licensed veterinarian or the chief animal control officer the severity of the injury or disease indicates that euthanasia is a humane course of action.
(d)
Any impounded animal that has no identification or rabies tag shall be held for a period of at least 72 hours. If the owner does not come forward and cannot be located, then after the period of impoundment, the animal shall become the property of the county. The county shall then be authorized to make whatever arrangements it deems appropriate for the animal or dispose of the animal in accordance with animal control policy.
(e)
Any impounded animal whose owner can be determined shall be held for a period of at least five days, during which the animal control officer shall attempt to locate and notify the animal's owner. If the owner does not come forward and cannot be located, then after the period of impoundment, the animal shall become the property of the county. An owner who has been located and notified shall pick up his animal and arrange to pay all fees including veterinary, moving, burial, or impoundment fees of any kind, within 36 hours of notification, or the animal will be considered abandoned, and the owner may be subject to citation for abandonment.
(f)
Any owner claiming an animal that has been impounded shall be charged a one-time impound fee plus a daily boarding fee, including any part of a day, for the period of impoundment, plus a rabies inoculation fee and any other fees, including those charged by outside contractors, if applicable, and reimbursement for any, vet, medical expenses, and any other costs which shall be the sole responsibility of the owner prior to the animal being released. In the event an animal is required to be quarantined during impoundment, an additional daily fee will be charged. An owner shall receive a one-time credit if proof is furnished of a current rabies vaccination, and a further credit if proof is furnished that the animal has been sterilized prior to impoundment.
(g)
A schedule of current impoundment and Union County boarding fees and credits in effect shall be available at the at the animal control office. Fees for outside contractors and boarding at other shelters and at veterinary facilities shall be the fees actually charged. The fees and any credits, which shall be payable directly to an outside contractor or to the county, may be changed at any time and from time to time as determined by the facility or the commissioner, and are not limited to the fees described herein. The fees payable to and collected by the county are not penalties, but are imposed for the sole purpose of defraying expenses borne by the county for animal control.
(h)
An animal surrendered to animal control for any reason may be immediately placed for adoption or humanely destroyed in the discretion of animal control so long as the owner has affirmatively represented in writing that he or she is the legal owner of the animal and the owner agrees to hold the county and its officials and employees harmless from any liability, claims, or damages that may be sustained by reason of the adoption or destruction of the animal.
(i)
Absent extreme circumstances, in no event shall any animal be redeemed by its lawful owner, possessor, or custodian unless all fees owed are paid, and unless the owner is in compliance with this chapter and all animal control rules and regulations.
(j)
A working dog that is found at large shall be considered under the control of its owner/handler when, upon investigation, it is found to have been engaged in a hunt, a hunting trial or training, or working, or is under voice command; and which has either a tracking collar and/or positive traceable identification. Upon proof of a rabies vaccination, the owner/handler shall not be issued a citation, nor incur an impoundment fee, but shall be required to pay all boarding fees and necessary medical costs as set forth in this section.
