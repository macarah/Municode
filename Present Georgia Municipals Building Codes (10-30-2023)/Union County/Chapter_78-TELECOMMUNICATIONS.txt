Requirements for obtaining a variance.
a.
A nonpreferred telecommunications tower or antenna request shall require the applicant to demonstrate in writing to the satisfaction of the commissioner why the applicant cannot use the following:
1.
An existing facility.
2.
A preferred location.
3.
A preferred configuration.
b.
In addition to the requirements set forth in subsection (1)a. of this section, the applicant shall also provide the following:
1.
Collocation sites or other preferred location sites that are located within the geographic service area of the proposed site.
2.
An explanation of good faith efforts and measures taken to secure each of the preferred location sites, and why each site is not technologically, legally or economically feasible for the applicant's needs.
3.
How and why the proposed site is essential to meet service demands for the geographic service area it will cover and for the countywide network as a whole.
c.
Applicants must identify all existing towers and all towers for which there are applications currently on file with the county or adjacent counties that could service the proposed search area. The applicant must provide evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers.
d.
The commissioner will review the variance request based on the justifications of undue expense and/or difficulties in entering into a lease agreement for collocation with a tower owner. The commissioner shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a facility's negative impacts at the proposed site and on the surrounding area.
e.
The commissioner will indicate to the applicant within 30 days whether a request for a variance permit should be pursued. If the commissioner feels that the applicant's request does not justify a variance permit, then both parties may agree on a minor variance compromise in writing that satisfies all parties and this article.
f.
At no time and under no circumstances shall the commissioner waive more than one of the preferred items (preferred location and preferred configuration) set forth in this article without requiring the applicant to apply for a variance permit. The commissioner shall charge an appropriate fee for county services and expenses in regards to the minor variance consideration, not to exceed $1,500.00.
(2)
Acquisition procedures.
a.
The cost of a variance permit shall be $1,500.00, plus any unusual or sustained costs that the commissioner shall deem necessary and appropriate. There shall be no limit to the unusual or sustained costs, except that they are actual and fair to all parties involved, and that they are agreed upon in writing prior to the execution of the variance process. In the event of unforeseen costs and expenses, both the commissioner and/or the applicant may amend their written agreement with both parties affirming the new agreement in writing. This process may repeat itself as long as both parties agree to it.
b.
In granting a variance permit, the commissioner may impose conditions to the extent that he concludes are necessary to minimize adverse effects from the proposed tower on adjoining or nearby properties.
c.
All engineering information that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer or qualified industry expert that is acceptable to the commissioner. The commissioner reserves the right to reject any expert or engineering submissions and request additional information from that or another source.
d.
Each applicant requesting a variance permit shall submit a site plan, scaled elevation view and supporting drawings, calculations and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts, showing the location and dimensions of all structures and improvements, including topography, utilizing minimum two-foot contour intervals, tower height requirements, setbacks, access driveways or easements, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses and any other information deemed necessary by the commissioner to assess compliance with this article and compatibility with surrounding uses.
e.
Before taking action upon a proposed variance permit, the commissioner shall hold a public hearing on the proposed variance permit. At least 30 days prior to the date of the public hearing, the commissioner shall cause the following notice requirements to be instituted:
1.
A sign shall be erected in a conspicuous location on or adjacent to the property under consideration. The sign shall state the date, time, place, location and purpose of the public hearing.
2.
A letter shall be sent by regular mail to all property owners of record of abutting parcels, giving notice of the public hearing. Owners of record shall be as indicated by the county tax commissioner's records. The letter shall at least state the same information as required in subsection (2)e.1. of this section for the erection of a sign.
