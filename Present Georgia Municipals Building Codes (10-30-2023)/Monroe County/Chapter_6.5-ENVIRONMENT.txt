Editor's note— An ordinance adopted April 1, 2014 did not specify manner of inclusion, hence, codification as ch. 6.5, art. II, §§ 6.5-51—6.5-63 was at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 6.5-51. - Purpose.
It is the purpose of this regulation to provide zoning classification requirements for the sitting of all solar energy systems and to promote the safe, effective and efficient use of solar farm development, construction and operation. Solar energy farms shall be a conditional use in A (agricultural), C (commercial), I (industrial).
(Ord. of 4-1-2014)
Sec. 6.5-52. - Definitions.
Words not defined herein shall be construed to have the meaning given by common and ordinary use and shall be interpreted within the context of the sentence and section in which they occur. Words used in the singular include the plural, and words used in the plural include the singular. Words used in the present tense include the future tense. The word "erected" includes the words "constructed," "located" or "relocated." The word "map" or "zoning map" means the zoning maps of the county. The word "parcel" includes the word "plot" or "lot." The word "person" includes the words "individuals," "firms," "partnerships," "corporations," "associations," "governmental bodies" and all other legal entities. The word "shall" is always mandatory and never discretionary. The words "used" or "occupied" include the words "intended, arranged or designed to be used or occupied." For the purpose of this section, certain terms used herein shall be defined as follows:
Mechanical equipment means any device associated with a solar energy system, such as an outdoor electrical unit/control box, that transfers the energy from the solar energy system to the intended on-site structure.
Solar access means a property owner's right to have sunlight shine on the owner's land. (The enforcement of this right is through the zoning ordinance that establishes height and setback requirements.)
Solar collection system means a panel or other solar energy device, the primary purpose of which is to provide the collection, inversion, storage, and distribution of solar energy for electricity generation, space heating, space cooling or water heating.
Solar energy equipment means any device associated with a solar energy system, such as an outdoor electrical unit/control box, that transfers the energy from the solar energy system to the intended on-site structure.
Solar energy farm means an energy conversion system, including appurtenances, which converts solar energy to a usable form of energy to be used on-site or to transfer to the public electric grid in order to sell electricity to a public utility entity. Property used in solar energy development, shall be termed a "solar farm" if the acreage of land utilized in its construction and installation exceeds five (5) acres.
Solar energy system means an energy conversion system, including appurtenances, which converts solar energy to a usable form of energy to meet all or part of the energy requirements of the on-site user. This definition shall include the terms passive solar and active solar systems.
Solar glare means the effect produced by light reflecting from a solar panel with an intensity sufficient to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and visibility.

Solar panels shall be placed such that concentrated solar radiation or glare shall not be directed onto nearby properties or roadways.
(l)
The design of the solar energy system shall conform to applicable industry standards. A building permit shall be obtained for a solar energy system per the Georgia Building Code, and the regulations adopted by the Department of Labor and Industry. All wiring shall comply with the applicable version of the National Electric Code (NEC). The local utility provider shall be contacted to determine grid interconnection and net metering policies.
