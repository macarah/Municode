(a)
Each district created pursuant hereto shall be administered by a board composed of a minimum of seven board members to be appointed and elected as hereinafter provided. One board member shall be appointed by the Cobb County board of commissioners. One board member shall be appointed by the governing authority of each municipality, if any portion of the district lies within the incorporated area of such municipality, and three board members shall be elected by the vote of electors, and three members shall be elected by the vote of equity electors. The board shall be seven in number plus one for each member appointed by the governing authority of each municipality as provided above. The members representing the electors and equity electors shall be elected to serve in post positions 1 through 6, respectively. Each elected board member must receive a majority of the votes cast for the post for which he or she is a candidate.

The initial term of office for the members representing posts 1 and 4 shall be two years. The initial term of office for the members representing posts 2 and 5 shall be two years and the initial term of office of the member representing posts 3 and 6 shall be three years. Thereafter, all terms of office shall be for three years, except the appointed board members who serve at the pleasure of the governing body which appointed them, respectively.
(b)
The initial board members to be elected as provided above shall be elected in a caucus of electors which shall be held within 60 days after the adoption of the resolutions and obtaining the written consents herein provided at such time and place within the district as the board of commissioners of Cobb County, or governing body of the municipality if the district lies wholly within the incorporated area thereof, shall designate after notice thereof shall have been given to said electors by publishing same in the legal organ of Cobb County as hereinafter provided. Thereafter, there shall be conducted biennially, not later than 60 days following the last day for filing ad valorem real property tax returns in Cobb County, a caucus of said electors at such time and place within the district as the board shall designate in such notice for the purpose of electing board members to those board member positions whose terms expire or are vacant. If a vacancy occurs in an election position on the board, the board shall, within 60 days thereof, call a special election to fill the same to be held within 60 days of the call unless such vacancy occurs within 180 days of the next regularly scheduled election, in which case a special election may, but need not, be called. For any election held hereunder, notice thereof shall be given to said electors by publishing notice thereof in the legal organ of Cobb County at least once each week for four weeks prior to such election.
(c)
Board members shall be subject to recall and the continued existence of the district or the continued existence of any one or more or any part thereof of the powers authorized to the district may be terminated as follows:
(1)
By election, called by a resolution of the board of commissioners of Cobb County;
(2)
By election, called by a resolution of the administrative board of the district;
(3)
By election, called by a petition of 20 percent of the electors or a petition by holders of 20 percent of eligible votes represented by equity electors;
(4)
Upon petition of either a majority of the electors within the district or a majority of the equity electors within the district, provided that, if the petition is for recall of an elected board member, the petition shall be from the category of voters who elected the board member;
(5)
Upon the termination of an agreement of cooperation. Termination is in the event such agreement of cooperation shall lapse (i.e., failure to reenact by the following December 31 after an existing agreement of cooperation shall expire on its own terms) or an affirmative resolution of rejection of an agreement or reenactment of an agreement of cooperation by any one of the necessary parties so that no agreement of cooperation is in force.
(d)
Board members, including appointed board members, shall be electors within the district. If a board member ceases to be an elector, such board member's position shall be declared vacant as of the date of the event terminating such status.
(e)
The board members shall receive no compensation for their services but shall be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. They shall elect one of their members as chairman and another as vice-chairman and shall also elect a secretary and a treasurer or a secretary-treasurer, either of whom may but need not be a member of the board.
(f)
If the boundaries of a district are subsequently changed after creation of the district to include land within a municipality which was not a party to the creation of the district, or if a municipality's boundaries are changed to include land within a then existing district, the governing authority of the municipality shall acquire the right to appoint a member to the board of the district upon entering into the cooperation agreement provided for in section 6-29 hereof. If the boundaries of a district or municipality are subsequently changed after creation of a district to include land within the unincorporated area of Cobb County and the district originally had no land within the unincorporated area of Cobb County, the board of commissioners of Cobb County shall acquire the right to appoint a member of the board of the district upon entering into the cooperation agreement provided for in section 6-29 hereof. If by municipal annexation or by deannexation of land from a district, the district no longer includes land within the unincorporated area of Cobb County or within a municipality, respectively, then upon such occurrence the board member of the district appointed by such governing authority in which the district is no longer located shall cease to be a board member.
(g)
Chapter 2 of title 21 of the O.C.G.A. (O.C.G.A. § 21-2-1 et seq.), the Election Code of Georgia, shall not apply to the election of district board members. Should a vacancy in office occur of a district board member, and the regular caucus of electors be more than six months in the future, a special election shall be called to fill such vacancy, unless filled by appointment as hereinabove required. The district board may adopt such bylaws not inconsistent herewith to provide for any matter concerning such elections.

Sec. 6-26. - Taxes, fees, and assessments.
(a)
The board may levy taxes, fees, and assessments within the district only on real property used nonresidentially, specifically excluding all property exempt from ad valorem taxation under the constitution or laws of the State of Georgia and all property used for residential, agricultural, or forestry purposes and specifically excluding tangible personal property and intangible property. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed five mills of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing governmental services and facilities which are specially required by the degree of density of development within the district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to the county or municipality as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by Cobb County if the district lies wholly or partly within the unincorporated area of Cobb County, and by the municipality within which it lies if it is wholly within a municipality, in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by Cobb County or the municipality, respectively. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Cobb County or municipal ad valorem taxes, respectively, and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied, less a fee to cover the costs of collection of one percent thereof, but not more than $25,000.00 in any one calendar year, shall be transmitted by Cobb County or the municipality who collects same, to the board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized hereby.
(b)
The board shall levy the above-provided taxes subsequent to the report of the assessed taxable values for the current calendar year and notify in writing the collecting governing bodies so they may include the levy on their regular ad valorem tax bills.
(c)
If, but for this provision, a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable, it shall continue to bear its tax millage then extant upon such event, for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding, until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded.

The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the board members of the district then in office and their successors.
(d)
The board shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems it expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of now [new] bonds, whether or not the bonds to be refunded have matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted hereunder. The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded, with such cash adjustments as may be agreed upon, or may be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase or redemption of the bonds to be refunded.
(e)
There shall be no limitation upon the interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates on any bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district; and the usury laws of this state shall not apply to bonds, notes, or other obligations of these districts.
(f)
Bonds issued by a district may be in such form, either coupon or fully registered, or both coupon and fully registered and may be subject to such exchangeability and transferability provisions as the bond resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds [or] as any indenture or trust agreement may provide.
(g)
Bonds shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the superior court of Cobb County may be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the date on which such bonds were validated; and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state.
(h)
In lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which such bonds are to bear, and the principal amount and maturities of such said bonds, the notice to the district attorney or the attorney general, the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing, and the petition and complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued will bear interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest (which may be fixed or may fluctuate [or] otherwise change from time to time) and that the principal amount will not exceed and the final maturity date will not be later than as specified in such notices and petition and complaint or may state that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) so specified, provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of a board to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such notices and in the petition and complaint.
(i)
The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed herein whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of a board, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district, or in notices or proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of a district.

Sec. 6-32. - Contents of agreements and instruments of board; use of proceeds of sale of bonds; subsequent issues of bonds; assumption of duties of board on termination of district.
(a)
Subject to the limitations and procedures provided by this section and by the immediately preceding section, the agreements or instruments executed by a board may contain such provisions not inconsistent with law as shall be determined by such board.
(b)
The proceeds derived from the sale of all bonds, notes, and other obligations issued by a district shall be held and used for the ultimate purpose of paying, directly or indirectly as permitted herein, all or part of the cost of any project, or for the purpose of refunding any bonds, notes, or other obligations issued in accordance hereunder.
(c)
Issuance by a board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue.
(d)
In the event that any district shall be terminated by either methods provided herein, the board shall serve until December 31 of the year in which terminations shall be approved for the purpose of concluding any ongoing matters and projects, but if such cannot be concluded by December 31, then the governing authority of the county shall assume the duties of the administrative board and shall be expressly authorized to exercise the authority of the administrative board. In the alternative, the governing authority of the county may, by resolution, assume all rights and obligations of the district, either bonds or otherwise, and the district shall cease to exist upon the adoption of such resolution.
