Sec. 7-1-19.3. - Specific mothballing procedures.
The three highest priorities for a mothballed building are:
1)
to ensure the public's health, safety and welfare; 2) to protect the building from sudden loss; and 3) to weatherize and maintain the property to stop moisture penetration.
( Ord. No. 6875 , § 1, 3-29-2006; Ord. No. 7327 , § 1(exh. A(7-1-19.3)), 2-21-2012; Ord. No. 7447 , § 1(exh. A(7-1-19.3)), 3-18-2014)
Sec. 7-1-19.4. - General mothballing procedures.
(a)
A properly mothballed building will have a watertight roof, secured doors and windows, repaired or stabilized rot problems, painted wood, repaired masonry, and well maintained grounds. All trash, debris, garbage should be removed from inside, outside and under the house.
(b)
To ensure compliance with this Code section, the property owner, at a minimum, should take the following actions:
(1)
The building's roof should be weather tight. Missing shingles should be replaced, holes should be repaired. Rolled roofing is acceptable as a temporary repair material; but if it is used, it must be securely installed.
(2)
Windows should be covered on the exterior with high grade plywood cut to fit within the window opening. Window coverings should be attached with screws to minimize damage to the window when they are removed. Window coverings should be painted a flat color - i.e., dark grey or black.
Alternative materials (i.e: plexiglass) may be approved by the Code Enforcement Manager.
(3)
The water should be turned off and the pipes drained. If the building has a functional sprinkler system, it should remain operational.
(4)
All electrical systems not necessary for security, fire prevention, and/or ventilation should be disconnected.
(5)
Exterior walls surfaces shall be free of breaks, holes, loose or missing materials to prevent deterioration. All exterior surfaces shall be repaired and protected from the elements including but not limited to porches, decks, balconies and fences. All metal surfaces subject to rust or corrosion shall be coated to inhibit such rust and corrosion. Gutters should be cleaned and inspected to verify that they discharge away from the building. Corrective measures should be taken as necessary.
(6)
Potential points for water intrusion, like crawlspace openings and basement windows, should be blocked and the water diverted away from the building; however, basement and crawlspace ventilation shall be maintained.
(7)
Loose architectural elements like brackets that should be documented, removed, and stored on site. Securely attached material should not be removed.
(8)
Chimneys should be securely blocked with heavy duty wire mesh to prevent animal intrusion.
(9)
The building should be adequately ventilated. Small openings covered with heavy duty wire mesh at the top of window coverings may be adequate. In humid climates, forced air ventilation may be necessary.
(10)
Vegetation around the building should be pruned back from the walls a minimum of twelve (12) inches to allow good airflow. Overhanging dead tree limbs and branches should be removed. The property grounds shall be maintained at all times (including bushes, beds, and other vegetation), the grass shall not exceed six (6) inches in height and the property shall be kept free of trash and debris at all times.
(11)
The owner shall establish a monitoring and maintenance schedule for the building. The schedule, at a minimum, should require that a drive-by inspection be done on a monthly basis.
