Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 7034 , § 2, adopted Feb. 19, 2008, amended the Code by the addition of § 2-2-33.1 et seq.; however, said provisions have been redesignated as § 2-2-43.1 et seq., at the editor's discretion, for purposes of consistency and allowing future expansion of the Code.

Sec. 2-2-43.1. - Purpose.
The Augusta-Richmond County Commission is authorized by the State Constitution pursuant to Article IX, § 2, ¶ 3(a)(5) and (9) and applicable State law to provide recreational programs and facilities and to provide public transportation services throughout Augusta to contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare and for protection of the natural and historical resources of Augusta. The Commission has determined that it will be able to provide these services more efficiently to the residents of Augusta and to visitors of Augusta through the construction and enhancement of public facilities to increase tourism in Augusta-Richmond County via implementation of a Transportation and Tourism Fee to be charged upon all hotel and motel rooms rented out in Augusta. In addition to increasing the efficiency of providing these services, the Transportation Fee shall also enhance the quality of transportation services provided and the tourism opportunities for both residents of Augusta and visitors to Augusta.
( Ord. No. 7034 , § 2, 2-19-2008)
Sec. 2-2-43.2. - Findings.
The Augusta-Richmond County Commission makes the following findings of fact:
1.
The Augusta-Richmond County Commission finds that providing the most efficient and cost effective Public Transportation System will benefit Augusta, the residents of Augusta and visitors to Augusta by providing transportation to individuals lacking transportation services and by relieving traffic congestion and environmental pollution by reducing the number of motor vehicles on the roadway through encouraging the public's use of a mass public transportation system.
2.
The Augusta-Richmond County Commission finds that Augusta-Richmond County constitutes a tourist destination for visitors to Augusta seeking to utilize the facilities of Augusta-Richmond County and to view areas of Augusta designated as Historic Heritage Districts.
3.
Augusta-Richmond County currently provides public mass transportation services and also provides tourism opportunities for both the residents of Augusta-Richmond County and visitors to Augusta-Richmond County.
4.
Establishing a Transportation and Tourism Fee will provide funds to enhance the transportation and tourism services, the value of which services will vastly exceed the fee charged to the hotel room occupants.
5.
The Transportation and Tourism Fee collected pursuant to this Section shall be used to provide transportation and tourism services by enhancing the availability of public transportation to hotel and motel occupants and by enhancing the Historic Heritage Districts that would constitute tourism destinations by residents of Augusta and visitors to Augusta.
6.
To generate sufficient amounts of tourism to fund the transportation and tourism services to be provided herein, Augusta-Richmond County needs to invest in local convention and entertainment facilities such as the Trade Exhibit and Event Center to promote commercial and recreational tourism in Augusta-Richmond County.
7.
The enhanced transportation services will provide needed public transportation between hotels, the Trade Exhibit and Event Center and other tourist destinations, including the Historic Heritage District, that will in turn increase tourism and conventions in Augusta. This increase in tourism will then help fund the enhancements to the public transportation services and the tourism services, benefiting visitors to and residents of Augusta-Richmond County.
