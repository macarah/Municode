For the purpose of electing members of the Augusta-Richmond County Commission, Richmond County is divided into 10 commission districts. One member of the board shall be elected from each such district. Commission Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 shall be and correspond to those eight numbered districts described in and attached to and made a part of this Act and further identified as Plan Name: richrev3 Plan Type: Local User: Gina Administrator: Richmond Co.

Commission District 10 shall be composed of a combination of Commission Districts 3, 6, 7, and 8 as each is described in such plan.
(2)
When used in such attachment, the terms 'Tract' and 'BG' (Block Group) shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. The separate numeric designations in a Tract description which are underneath a 'BG' heading shall mean and describe individual Blocks within a Block Group as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Richmond County which is not included in any such district described in that attachment shall be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia.

Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Except as otherwise provided in the description of any commission district, whenever the description of such district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia.
