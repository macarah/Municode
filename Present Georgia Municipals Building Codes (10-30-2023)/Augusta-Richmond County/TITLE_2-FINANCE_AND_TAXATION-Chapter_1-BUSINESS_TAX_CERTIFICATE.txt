However, for convenience of both Augusta-Richmond County and the Taxpayer, each business subject to the Occupation Tax levied in section 2-2-4 hereof shall, on or before the dates hereinafter set forth, file with the License and Inspection Department the return hereinafter specifically provided for, showing the gross receipts of that business during the preceding year from October 1 through September 30.

The actual and final amount of Tax levied for business transacted in the current calendar year shall be paid in accordance with a final return to be made after the end of the year, in accordance with the procedure set forth herein.
(b)
The owner, proprietor, manager, or secretary officer of the business subject to said Occupation Tax of the current calendar year shall, by November 15 of the current calendar year, file with the License and Inspection Department of Augusta-Richmond County, on a form furnished by said officer, a signed return setting forth the amount of gross receipts of such business for the entire twelve (12) months from October 1 of the preceding calendar year through September 30 of the current year. This return will be used to determine the final Tax for the calendar year just completed and as an estimate of the gross receipts and Occupation Tax for the current year.
(c)
Where a business subject to the Occupation Tax for the calendar year has been conducted for only a part of the preceding year, the amount of gross receipts for such part shall be reported in said return. Said return shall also show a figure putting the receipts for such part of a year on an annual basis with the part-year receipts bearing the same ratio to the whole-year gross receipts as the part year bears to the whole year. Said figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year in establishing the business Tax liability.
Sec. 2-1-22. - Filing of return showing actual gross receipts during calendar year; procedure where taxes overpaid or underpaid.
(a)
On or before November 15 of each year, the owner, proprietor, manager, or executive officer of the business liable for said Occupation Tax levied for the year shall file with the License and Inspection Department of Augusta-Richmond County, on a form furnished by License and Inspection Department, a signed return setting forth the actual amount of the gross receipts of such business during the preceding year as provided in section 2-2-22.
(b)
If the amount of the Occupation Tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said Tax provided for in this chapter, is less than the amount of Occupation Tax theretofore paid by said business based on the estimate filed pursuant to section 2-2-22 hereof, the difference in said amount shall be due and payable by the Taxpayer to Augusta-Richmond County on July 1 of the current year and delinquent if not paid within ninety (90) days thereof.
(c)
If the amount of the Occupation Tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said Tax provided for in this chapter, exceeds the amount of Occupation Tax theretofore paid by said business based on the estimate filed pursuant to section 2-2-22 hereof, the difference in said amount shall be refundable by Augusta-Richmond County to the Taxpayer; or, if said business continues to be conducted in said Augusta-Richmond County during the current year, such difference in amount may be credited by Augusta-Richmond County on the amount of Occupation Tax to be paid to Augusta-Richmond County by said business for the current year.

All contents of said return shall be confidential and open only to the officials, employees, agents, or clerks of Augusta-Richmond County using said returns for the purpose of this Occupation Tax levy and the collection of the Tax. Independent auditors or bookkeepers employed by Augusta-Richmond County shall be classed as "employees" for this purpose. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the publication by Augusta-Richmond County officials of statistics, so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and items thereof; or the inspection of the records by duly qualified employees of the Tax departments of the State of Georgia, the United States, and other local governments.
