The hearing before the planning and zoning commission shall be a public hearing as aforesaid, and be conducted as hereinafter provided.
(b)
At the commencement of the hearing, the presiding officer shall give a brief explanation of the matter under consideration and the issue or issues to be determined. Following such explanation, the petitioner and proponents of the petition seeking a change in zoning, or the proponents of any other proposed amendment to this chapter, as the case may be, shall be afforded the first opportunity to present their case and evidence to the planning and zoning commission. After this presentment, all parties in opposition shall be afforded an opportunity to present their opposition and evidence, and, after all parties have been so heard by the planning and zoning commission, the planning and zoning commission may, but shall not be required to permit one (1) person to summarize the evidence and arguments of the proponents, and one (1) person to summarize the evidence and arguments of the parties in opposition, limiting the time for the presentation of such summaries to the extent the planning and zoning commission chairman deems appropriate. The presiding officer shall also have the authority to limit the time for presentation of evidence to the extent that the presiding officer deems appropriate. After all parties have been heard and such summaries, if any, have been completed, the planning and zoning commission chairman shall close the floor to open debate and further evidence, and once the floor is closed to open debate and further evidence, and deliberation has begun by the planning and zoning commission on the issue before it, no further evidence may be presented on arguments made either for or against the proposed rezoning or other amendments to this chapter being considered without the expressed consent of the planning and zoning commission. Thereafter, the planning and zoning commission shall begin deliberations and shall take into consideration all evidence properly before it and all pertinent standards and factors set forth in this chapter.
(c)
When a decision has been reached the planning and zoning commission shall make its written report on the proposed change in zoning or other amendment to this chapter to the Mayor and Council, reporting the vote of each member of the planning and zoning commission thereon. If such report is not made within thirty (30) days after the public hearing, the petition for rezoning or other amendment to this chapter shall be deemed to have been recommended for approval. Such reports of the planning and zoning commission shall be filed with the City Clerk, who shall, upon the date said report is received, post a copy thereof as a regular notice at the place for posting such notices in City and shall forward a copy thereof to the petitioner for rezoning, if any, at the address shown in the petition for such rezoning. A copy of said report shall also be delivered to the Mayor, all Council members and the building inspector. Should a petition fail to comply with any requirements of this chapter pertaining to the petition prior to the time said public hearing is held, the petition shall for said reason be denied by the planning and zoning commission without inquiring into its merits. If the petitioner desires to further pursue the matter of rezoning the property in question, the petitioner must file a new petition requesting a change in the zoning of the property in question; pay an additional sum as fixed from time to time by the Mayor and Council to cover administrative and advertising costs; and comply with all requirements of this chapter pertaining to a petition for rezoning, whereupon the planning and zoning commission shall proceed to hear said petition on its merits.

Once deliberation begins by the Mayor and Council on the issue before it, no further evidence may be presented or arguments made either for or against the proposed rezoning or other amendments to this chapter being considered without the expressed consent of the Council.
(b)
Since one (1) of the functions of the planning and zoning commission is to consider and plan for the long-range development of the City, the Mayor and Council shall give great weight to the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission.

Sec. 8-4-148 - Standards and factors to be considered in making zoning decisions.
modified
(a)
The Mayor and Council recognizes that the proper exercise of its zoning powers requires the consideration and balancing of the public interest in protecting and promoting the public health, safety, morality and general welfare against the right to unrestricted use of property. To ensure a proper balancing of the aforesaid interests, the planning and zoning commission in considering amendments to the zoning ordinance and applications to rezone property for the purpose of making recommendations to the Mayor and Council, and the planning and zoning commission in considering or making any zoning decision including, but not limited to, decisions concerning amendments to the zoning ordinance and applications to rezone property, shall consider the following standards and factors:
(1)
The existing land use pattern, and existing uses and zoning of nearby property;
(2)
Whether existing boundaries of use districts or zones are illogically drawn in relation to existing conditions affecting the property proposed for change;
(3)
Whether changed or changing conditions make the passage of the proposed zoning appropriate;
(4)
Whether the zoning proposal will permit a use that is suitable in view of the location of the subject property and the development of adjacent and nearby properties;
(5)
The suitability of the subject property for the purpose of the zoning classification proposed for it;
(6)
Is this request a logical extension of a use district or zone boundary which would improve the pattern of uses in the general area;
(7)
The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned considered in the context of subsection (1) above and development in the vicinity of the property;
(8)
Whether the property to be affected by the zoning proposal has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned;
(9)
Whether the zoning proposal will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby properties;
(10)
The extent to which property values are diminished by the particular zoning restrictions, and the extent to which any such diminution in, or destruction of the property values of the owner of the subject property promotes the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the public;
(11)
The population density pattern and the possible increase in the use of, or the overloading of public facilities, including but not limited to, water and sewer systems, and streets;
(12)
The cost to the local government in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining water service, sewer service, streets and public safety measures;
(13)
Whether this request requires a major change in existing levels of public service which cannot feasibly be financed by the local government;
(14)
Accessibility of public transportation to the property;
(15)
Whether the zoning proposal is in conformity with the policy and intent of any then-existing land use plan;
(16)
Is the property likely to be used for the use requested;
(17)
The aesthetic effect of existing and future use of the property as it relates to the surrounding area;
(18)
Impact on environment, including but not limited to drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality, and water quality and quantity;
(19)
Whether there exists a substantial need for the restrictions imposed or contemplated upon the use of the subject property in the interest of the public health, morals, safety or welfare;
(20)
The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner, and the relative loss to the public, as compared to the benefit gained by the individual property owner;
(21)
Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal; and
(22)
Any other factors relevant to the balancing of the public interest in protecting and promoting the public health, safety, morality and general welfare against the right to unrestricted use of property.
(b)
The Mayor and Council shall also consider such of the foregoing factors as may be relevant to consideration of any issue before it or decision concerning the rezoning of property, any amendment to the zoning ordinance or any issues before it on appeal.

(c)
Variances for historic structures. Variance may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(d)
Flood damage prevention variances. In regards to the requirements of the Chapter 3 of this Title 8, variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. In reviewing such requests, the Mayor and Council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of the flood damage prevention ordinance. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted under this subjection shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(e)
Reasonable accommodation variance. The Mayor and Council may issue a variance from the strict application of the regulations of the City's Code whenever it is found that reasonable accommodation is necessary to afford persons with disabilities equal opportunities. In determining whether a particular accommodation is reasonable, the Mayor and Council shall consider whether the request imposes an undue burden or expense on the City and whether the proposed accommodation would create a fundamental alteration in the City's code.

(c)
