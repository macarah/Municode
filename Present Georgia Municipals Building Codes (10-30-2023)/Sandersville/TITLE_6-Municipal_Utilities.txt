(8)
Useful life. Estimated useful period during which a treatment works will be operated is 30 years.
(9)
Federal regulations. Water Pollution Control Act (PL 84-660).
(b)
The City has received federal grant funds under PL 84-660 as amended, and is required to develop an Equitable Cost Recovery (ECR) system in compliance with the applicable federal regulations under PL 84-660. All provisions of this chapter are subject to the approval of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and any subsequent changes are subject to U.S. EPA approval.
(c)
All industrial users connected to the municipal sewer system who discharge other than domestic wastes shall pay an annual Equitable Cost Recovery charge in accordance with a formula maintained by the Mayor and Council.
(d)
The sewer commission may elect to receive the ECR payment either in monthly installments or annually.
(e)
Industrial users of this class are subject to the surcharge provisions of section 6-2-6, paragraphs (j) and (k) where applicable.
(f)
Any significant revision to the approved ECR system must be submitted to, and approved by, the regional administrator (or the state water pollution control agency, when certified to do so by the regional administrator) prior to implementation. Significant revisions include any modification of the provisions of the ordinance establishing the legal framework of the ECR system or any change in the method of ECR allocation to individual industries. Changes in ECR payments from individual industries caused by changes in the waste discharged by those industries or by the entrance of new industries into the system do not require EPA approval.
(g)
All significant industrial users shall furnish the City with a letter of intent expressing their intent to pay the share of the federal grant allocable to the treatment of their wastes. The letter shall include a statement of the user's intended period of use and the amount of capacity the user wishes to have allocated for treatment of its wastes (the term "capacity" refers to pollutant strength as well as volume of discharge). If an industrial user discontinues use of the treatment works in the future, its payment for cost recovery will cease and the capacity formerly utilized by that industry will become available for increases in loading from existing users, or for new industrial users who will assume their proportional share of the capital costs during the remaining portion of the recovery period. In the event of an industry's discontinuance, the amount of costs recovered will decline. There is no requirement for other industries to assume the portion of the ECR payment which is unrecovered due to the departure of an industry.
(h)
The City shall determine the method of monitoring the discharge of industrial users and whether or not the monitoring shall be continuous or at regular intervals. The cost of all monitoring shall be borne by the industry being served.
(i)
The industrial cost recovery period will commence upon completion of project construction. In instances where that is not appropriate, e.g., where industrial use commences more than one (1) year before the project completion date, the ECR period will begin from the date of beneficial use by the first industrial user. Not later than 30 days after commencement of the ECR period, the City will notify the regional administrator, in writing, of the date of this implementation of the ECR system. The first payment to the City by industrial users shall be made not later than one (1) year after the beginning of the ECR period. The initiation of the ECR system can occur before or after the final construction inspection or after the final audit and need not be related to either of these events.
(j)
Pre-existing agreements between applicants and industry, or between applicants and other political jurisdictions, whereby industrial users would pay less than their allocable share of a federal grant cannot be recognized, regardless of the validity of such agreements as a matter of state law.
(k)
The volume of wastewater from any building sewer which exceeds two percent (2%) of the average daily flow of the sewer system and which is allowed to discharge the full volume to a public sewer will cause the user to be subject to a charge based on a formula maintained by the Mayor and Council. The sewer commission shall determine the average daily flow from all users periodically and shall determine the average daily flow of the user by actual measurement and/or flow estimates to determine the charge for flow above two percent (2%) of the sewer system average daily flow. The user may request actual measurements of his sewerage discharge at any time and obtain same, provided that user bears the expense.

Sec. 6-2-9 - Repair and maintenance work.
(a)
Any repair or maintenance work in connection with sewer pipes and drains connected directly or indirectly to any sanitary or storm sewer system or storm drain shall be performed in accordance with specifications approved by and under the supervision and inspection of the sewer commission.
(b)
For work performed on sewers, pipes, laterals, or drains which are not a part of a sanitary sewer or storm sewer system at the direction or under the supervision of the sewer commission for the particular or special benefit of any individual parcel or portion of real property, a charge is hereby established in an amount equal to the actual cost thereof to the commission.
(c)
The commission shall annually assess against the individual parcel of land the amount of any such charges remaining unpaid on October 1 and such charges shall be added to the tax roll and collected in the same manner and at the same time as the other taxes are assessed, levied and collected pursuant to statute.
(Ord. of 9/12/77)
Sec. 6-2-10 - Power and authority of inspectors.
(a)
The superintendent and other duly authorized employees of the sewer commission, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter upon all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing or proper activities in accordance with the terms of this provision or any regulations promulgated thereunder. The powers and authority herein granted shall be in addition to powers of inspection otherwise granted by law to sewer commissions.
(b)
The sewer commission or its authorized representatives shall be permitted access to information which has a direct bearing on the volume, type and quantity of pollutants and source of discharge to the public sewers or waterways or sewer works.
(Ord. of 9/12/77)
Sec. 6-2-11 - Enforcement, remedies and penalties.
(a)
Any sewerage user permit issued shall be subject to cancellation after a hearing in the event of a finding by the sewer commission at such hearing that the user or permittee of the sewerage system has violated these provisions. Such hearing shall take place on 10 days' written notice to the permittee or user. Upon any cancellation provided for in this subsection or otherwise in this section, the sewer commission may terminate the use of the sewer by severing the connection to the sewage works.
(b)
Any person violating these provisions of this chapter shall be responsible in money damages for any injury to the sewer system or expense caused the commission by such violation. This money may be collected by civil action in the Superior Court of the State of Georgia. Obedience to these provisions may also be enforced by injunction.
(c)
Any person violating any provisions of this chapter and interfering with, entering or using the sewer systems without obtaining permission hereunder, shall be guilty of an offense and subject to a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $100, or to imprisonment of not less than one (1) day nor more than two (2) months, or both such fine and imprisonment, and in addition when a violation of these provisions is continuous, each 24 hours' duration shall constitute a separate, distinct and additional violation.
