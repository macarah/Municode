Sec. 8-4-41 - Establishment of districts.
modified
In order that the purposes of this chapter may be accomplished, there are hereby established within the City the zoning districts identified as follows:
(1)
A-1 agricultural district. The purpose of these districts is to provide single-family residential areas with minimum lot sizes of three (3) acres, said areas being protected from the depreciating effects of small lot development, and also permitting rural agricultural uses.
(2)
R-1 single-family residential district. The purpose of this district is to provide single-family residential areas with minimum lot sizes of twelve thousand (12,000) square feet, said areas being protected from the depreciating effects of small lot development and excessive density and from the encroachment of those uses which are incompatible to a desirable residential environment.
(3)
R-2 single-family residential district. The purpose of this district is to provide single-family residential areas with minimum lot sizes of eight thousand (8,000) square feet, said areas being protected from the depreciating effects of small lot development and excessive density and from the encroachment of those uses which are incompatible to a desirable residential environment.
(4)
R-3 multi-family residential district. The purpose of this district is to provide orderly development of high density residential areas for one-, two- and multi-family dwellings, said areas being protected from the encroachment of those uses which are incompatible to a desirable residential environment.
(5)
R-4 manufactured home community district. The purpose of this district is to provide areas within the City exclusively for manufactured home communities, manufactured homes and mobile homes, and for buildings directly related to the operation of the manufactured home community. Manufactured home communities shall have a minimum of three (3) acres with manufactured home spaces of at least four thousand (4,000) square feet each.
(6)
C-1 central business district. The purpose of this district shall be to enhance and protect shopping facilities in the central business district of the City.
(7)
C-2 general commercial district. The purpose of the general commercial district is to provide for those business activities which are larger users of space than commercial uses serving the central commercial district and to provide for those business activities which cater to the needs of individual neighborhoods, and highway business areas.
(8)
I-1 light industrial district. The purpose of this district shall be to provide and protect areas for those industrial uses which do not create excessive noise, odor, smoke, dust, and which do not possess other objectionable characteristics which might be detrimental to surrounding neighborhoods, or to the other uses permitted in the district.
(9)
I-2 heavy industrial district. The purpose of the heavy industrial district is to provide a location for those industrial operations and processes which are not considered nuisances but which have objectionable characteristics that are not injurious to the health, safety and general welfare of the public.
(10)
F-H flood hazard district. The purpose of the flood hazard district is to identify areas of the City that are defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as being subject to periodic flooding and to limit development to uses that will be least damaged by flooding.
(11)
I-O institutional/office district. This district is intended to encourage development of suitable business and professional enterprises of a character and density deemed compatible with the general area in which it is located. It is restricted to professional and business offices and for retail uses in conjunction with any normally appurtenant institutional/office uses.
(Ord. No. 2019-01 , 4/15/19)
Sec. 8-4-42 - Zoning map.
modified
(a)
The boundaries of each district are shown on a map entitled "Zoning Map of Sandersville, Georgia," dated February 2, 1981, or subsequent revisions, and certified by the Mayor of Sandersville. Said map and all explanatory matter thereon accompanies and is hereby made a part of this chapter.
(b)
An accurate copy of the "Zoning Map of Sandersville, Georgia" shall be on file in the office of the zoning administrator at all times. Said map shall accurately show all map amendments made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and the date when said amendments became effective. It shall be the duty of the zoning administrator to see to it that the "Zoning Map of Sandersville, Georgia" displayed in his office is kept up to date and accurately shows all amendments approved by the Mayor and Council.
(Ord. No. 2019-01 , 4/15/19)
Sec. 8-4-43 - Interpretation of zoning district boundaries.
modified
When uncertainty exists with respect to the location of boundaries of any zoning district as shown on the "Zoning Map of Sandersville, Georgia," the following rules shall apply:
(1)
Where district boundaries are depicted as approximately following the center lines of streets or highways, center lines of streams or drainage ways, street lines, or highway right-of-way lines, such center lines, street lines, or highway right-of-way lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
(2)
Where district boundaries are so depicted that they approximately follow the lot lines, such lots shall be construed to be said boundaries.
(3)
Where district boundaries are so depicted that they are approximately parallel to the center lines of streets, highways, or railroads, or rights-of-way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated in the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on said zoning map.
(4)
Where a district boundary line, as appears on the zoning map, divides a lot in single ownership at the time of enactment of this chapter, the district requirements for the least restricted portion of such lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof, provided that such extension shall not include any part of such a lot more than thirty-five (35) feet beyond the district boundary lines.
