ARTICLE E. - SIGN REGULATIONS

Sec. 8-4-81 - Purposes.
modified
(a)
It is the purpose of the Mayor and City Council in enacting these regulations to provide standards to safeguard life, public health, property and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, erection, maintenance and quality of materials of all signs. More specifically, signs have a powerful impact on the aesthetic environment of the community, and it is the purpose of this article to encourage an aesthetically attractive environment, allowing sufficient opportunities for communications to serve business, interest groups and the public, while complying with the federal and state constitutions and laws. Signs create visual clutter and therefore should be regulated in their size, location, construction and illumination. Signs can detract from the beauty of the neighborhood and lower property values. In seeking to comply with federal and state law, the City has determined the following: large signs are, as the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, an aesthetic harm; the state supreme court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of environment; and, the 11th Circuit has recognized portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard. These holdings show that the City's ordinance is within the law and constitutional, which is a goal of the City. The goal of this article is to avoid being an impermissible content-based regulation, and instead to be a permissible time, place and manner restriction.
(b)
Many signs can also be a hazard and negatively impact traffic safety by distracting drivers and blocking views of other vehicles and dangers, by making intersections more treacherous, and by making it difficult to see oncoming traffic when entering a roadway. Therefore, it is also the purpose of this article to prevent those harms by regulating signs to safe locations, safe sizes, with proper and safe illumination and construction.

modified
(a)
This article shall apply to all properties within the incorporated areas of the City. This article shall not relate to the copy or message on signs within the City.
(b)
All signs and sign structures shall be constructed and maintained in conformance with the state minimum standard codes.
(c)
If any provisions or requirements of this article are in conflict with any other provision or requirement of this article or any other applicable governmental law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or other governmental regulation of any kind, the more restrictive rule or standard takes precedence.

Sec. 8-4-85 - Regulations for signs.
modified
(a)
Location, height, and setback.
(1)
The property owner must give permission for all sign placement on the owner's property, through the issuance of a letter signed by the owner.
(2)
All signs must comply with all side and rear setbacks of this chapter.
(3)
Signs can be located in front setback areas, but all signs and sign structures, except as noted below, must be set back at least ten (10) feet from the public right-of-way. No portion of a sign or sign structure shall encroach on or overhang the public right-of-way or any other person's property. Furthermore, for safety reasons, no sign shall be located closer than ten (10) feet from the back of the curb of a public roadway, or if there is no curb, from the edge of the pavement.
(4)
Distances are measured from the closest portion of the sign (whether that is the base, sign face, or the sign structure) to the right-of-way, curb or pavement.
(5)
The height requirements of a sign shall be computed as the length of a straight vertical line from normal grade to the height of the highest attached component of the sign or sign structure. When the sign is constructed within fifteen (15) feet of a right-of-way, the normal grade shall be considered the elevation of the crown of the road. When a sign is constructed fifteen (15) or more feet from any right-of-way, normal grade shall be considered the lower of:
a.
Existing grade of the site of the sign prior to construction of the sign; or
b.
The newly established grade at the base of the sign after construction, exclusive of any filling, beaming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign.
(b)
Number. For the purpose of determining the number of signs, ground signs shall be equal to the number of sign structures. All other non-ground signs shall be considered to be a single display surface or display device containing elements organized, related and composed to form a unit.
(c)
Illumination.
(1)
Ground signs cannot be internally illuminated except where expressly permitted by this article. All signs may be externally illuminated. External illumination of any sign in any district shall be positioned and shielded so that the light source does not shine directly into the path of motorists on a public right-of-way or into the windows of adjacent dwellings or businesses without the permission of the owner and resident thereof. Signs located in residential districts shall not be illuminated between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
(2)
Flashing, blinking or otherwise varying illumination is not permitted. No external or internal illumination that causes confusion with or distraction from any traffic signal or safety device shall be permitted.
(3)
All externally illuminated signs shall utilize low wattage luminaries, mounted in fixtures designed to direct the light and eliminate light trespass, such as light shining into residences or other neighboring structures.
(4)
All internally illuminated signs shall utilize low wattage luminaries designed to reduce light glow.
(5)
All illuminated signs over ten (10) feet in height shall either be internally illuminated or illuminated by external lighting fixtures not visible to passing motorists.
(6)
Internally illuminated signs shall only be permissible on lots zoned for non-residential uses.
(7)
No sign shall give off light which glares, blinds, or has any other adverse effect on traffic or adjacent properties. The light from an illuminated sign shall be established in such a way that adjacent properties and roadways are not adversely affected and that no direct light is cast upon adjacent properties and roadways. This shall be determined by measuring the footcandles (lumens per square foot) that fall on adjacent properties or the public right-of-way. No sign shall exceed 0.5 footcandles at any adjacent property line in a residential district or two (2) footcandles at any public right-of-way.
(8)
Multiple-message signs. Multiple-message signs are those which change the message or copy on the sign face mechanically or electronically by movement or rotation of panels or slates, or by changing electronic display on the sign face. They are subject to the following restrictions:
a.
No multiple-message sign may change its message or copy, or any pictures or images that are part of the message, more frequently than once every minute, provided that multiple-message billboards shall be allowed to change the copy or images that are part of the message not more frequently than once every ten (10) seconds.
b.
When the message of a multiple-message sign is changed mechanically, it shall be accomplished in three (3) seconds or less. When the message of a multiple-message sign is changed in an electronic manner, through the use of light emitting diodes, back lighting or other light source, the transition shall occur within two (2) seconds.
c.
When any multiple-message sign is located within one hundred fifty (150) feet of any residential district, the display of multiple-messages shall discontinue between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., and the sign shall be static and not display more than one (1) message during that period.
(d)
Calculation of area. The area of a sign is calculated by determining the area of the smallest square or rectangle which encloses the sign face and the structure surrounding the sign face. For example, the pole or base would not be included, but any frame holding the sign face in place would be counted. See examples:
Examples of Sign Face Area
Measurements
(e)
Unusual shaped signs. Unusual shaped signs are signs that are any shape other than a square or rectangle, and include signs with projecting elements or features, round, oval, and triangular signs, signs with more than four (4) sides, signs in the shape of an animal, object, or device, and so forth. For all such signs, the area is calculated by calculating the area of the smallest rectangle that will completely enclose all elements of the sign face and sign structure supporting the face, not including the base, or any open space.
(f)
Sign support structures. Signs three hundred (300) square feet per face or larger must be constructed with a monopole-type support system.

Good repair. All signs, together with all their supports, braces, guys, and anchors shall be kept in good repair. Any structure formally used as a sign, but not in use for any other purpose, must be removed by the owner of the property within ten (10) days after written notification from a designated City official or thirty (30) days after its use as a valid sign has ceased, after which time, the City may cause the removal of the sign at the owner's expense.
(g)
Removal of unsafe signs and safety hazards. The City may remove a sign in violation of this article, without giving notice to any party, if said sign is upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property, or said sign poses an immediate safety threat to the life or health of any members of the public.

Signs using electrical wiring and connections (i.e., illuminated signs), as well as larger signs, may require additional permits under the City building code, and the building official should be contacted regarding such signs.
(b)
All parties are advised to consult with the zoning administrator to avoid erecting signs that violate this article. No person shall obtain a vested right to maintain a sign that does not comply with this article at the time it is erected. Signs erected in violation of this article shall be removed or reconstructed in compliance with this article.
(c)
Permit applications for conforming signs shall be filed by the sign owner or his agent with the zoning administrator upon forms furnished by the City.

(4)
Permit expiration. A permit shall become null and void if construction of the sign has not begun within six (6) months from the date of issuance. Issuance of a permit shall in no way prevent the City from later declaring the sign to be nonconforming or unlawful if, with further review of available information, the sign is found not to comply with the requirements of the ordinance applicable at the time that the complete permit application was filed.
(5)
Violation. A violation of any provisions of this article will be grounds for termination of a permit granted by the City for the erection of a sign. Should it be determined that a permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this article, the zoning administrator or his designee shall revoke the permit. No information shall be required regarding the content of the sign. Any person failing to obtain a permit prior to construction shall be subject to citation and, upon conviction, shall be punished in accordance with the enforcement provisions of this chapter and applicable law.

(1)
There must be existing property rights in the sign;
(2)
The right to continue a nonconforming sign is confined to the sign owner or his transferee;
(3)
A nonconforming sign may be restored to its original condition, provided that not more than fifty (50) percent of the sign is destroyed.
