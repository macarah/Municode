CHAPTER 6 - Wetland Protection

Sec. 8-6-1 - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within the City of Sandersville, Georgia are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia.
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
It is therefore necessary for the City of Sandersville, Georgia to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands.
(b)
Title and purpose. This chapter shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of the City of Sandersville, Georgia. The purpose of this chapter is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this chapter is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.
(Ord. of 8/21/00(1))
Sec. 8-6-2 - Wetland protection district.
(a)
Wetland protection district. This chapter shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the City of Sandersville, Georgia. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this chapter, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the City of Sandersville Clerk.
(b)
Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and the wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the City of Sandersville, Georgia and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this ordinance does not relieve the land owner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(c)
Relationship to zoning. The wetland protection district is hereby established. The wetland protection district shall comprise an overlay zone that supplements and is indicated on the City of Sandersville Zoning Map, which is hereby incorporated and made part of this ordinance by reference. When the two (2) ordinances conflict, the more restrictive ordinance shall apply.
(Ord. of 8/21/01(1))
Sec. 8-6-3 - Local development permits.
(a)
Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the City of Sandersville in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in Subsection 8-6-3(b) below shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within two hundred (200) feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the City of Sandersville or authorized designee using the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a Section 404 Permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 Permit or letter of permission.
(b)
Permissible uses (uses as of right.) The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein.
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an additional 404 Permit.
(2)

(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

•Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations.
•Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of Subsection 8-6-3(b)(4).
•Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.

The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The City of Sandersville shall require no more than a twenty-five (25) percent adjustment of side, rear and front setbacks for each affected lot.
(2)
Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the City of Sandersville will allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least twenty-five (25) percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel all land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible.
