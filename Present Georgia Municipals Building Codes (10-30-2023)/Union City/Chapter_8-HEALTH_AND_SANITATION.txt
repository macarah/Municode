ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 8-1. - Care of premises—Required; notice to remove rubbish, etc.
(a)
It shall be unlawful for the owner or occupant of a residential or commercial building, structure or property to utilize, use or permit the use of the premises of such residential or commercial property for the open storage of any abandoned motor vehicle, ice box, refrigerator, stove, glass, building material, building rubbish or similar items. It shall be the duty and responsibility of every such owner or occupant to keep the premises of such residential or commercial property clean and to remove from the premises all such abandoned items as listed above, including but not limited to weeds, dead trees, excessively tall grass, trash, rubbish, garbage, etc., upon notice from the city clerk or premises inspector. Specifically excluded from this section are those disposal facilities or sites as defined in Chapter 7 of the Union City Code of Ordinances and regulated in accordance with such chapter and state laws, and the business premises of those junk dealers holding current and valid licenses issued pursuant to section 9-25 of the Union City Code of Ordinances.
(b)
For the purpose of this section, an abandoned motor vehicle is defined as one that is in a state of disrepair and incapable of being moved under its own power.
(c)
It shall be the duty and responsibility of every such owner or occupant to keep the premises of such property clean and to remove from the premises all such items as listed in subsection (a) above upon notice from the city clerk or premises inspector. The notice shall be in writing and shall set forth the hazard to be removed. This notice shall require the owner or occupant to remove the hazard within seven (7) days or, if the hazard set forth in the notice is the first such offense during a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, the owner or occupant may file an appeal in writing to the mayor and council of the city. If the occupant is not the owner of record, according to the city tax returns, a copy of the notice shall be delivered or mailed to the owner.
(d)
Should the owner or occupant, after notice, fail to remove the hazard as complained, it shall be the duty of the city clerk or premises inspector to cause the same to be removed by the use of city equipment and employees. If the city does not have sufficient equipment and/or employees to perform the removal, the city clerk or premises inspector, with the approval of the mayor and council of the city may contract with outside forces for the removal of the hazard. The total cost to the city for removing the hazard shall be a special lien against the property, placed upon the tax records of the city and subject to foreclosure.
(e)
Should the owner or occupant give cause to receive notice for more than one (1) offense for the same violation during a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, the city clerk or premises inspector shall issue a citation to the owner or occupant to appear before the city court and there shall be no appeal to the mayor and council of the city for the second or subsequent offense occurring during a period of twelve (12) consecutive months.
(Ord. No. 83-2, 4-5-83; Ord. No. 93-6, 7-20-93)
Sec. 8-2. - Same—Appeal; authority, duty of mayor and council; right of aggrieved party.
(a)
Hearing; time; conduct. The mayor and council of the city shall normally hold hearings on appeals filed pursuant to section 8-1 within thirty (30) days after they are filed. The mayor and council, when so appealed to and after a public hearing, may vary the application of any provision of section 8-1 to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would be manifest injustice, and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this chapter or the public interest, or when, in its opinion, the interpretations of the city clerk or premises inspector should be modified or renewed.
(b)
Decision. The decision of the mayor and council to vary the application of any provision of this section or to modify an order of the city clerk or premises inspector, shall specify in what manner such variation or modification is made, the conditions upon which it is made, and reasons therefor. Every decision shall be a public record and a certified copy thereof shall be sent by mail or otherwise to the appellant.
(c)
Effect of appeal. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from until a decision thereon shall have been made by the mayor and council.
(d)
Application for court relief. A person aggrieved by a decision of the mayor and council of the city, whether previously a party to the proceeding or not, may within fifteen (15) days after the rendition of the decision apply to the appropriate court for any relief afforded by the laws of the state.
(e)
Duty of building official. If the decision of the mayor and council reverses or modifies a refusal or disallowance of the city clerk or premises inspector, or various application of this chapter, the city clerk or premises inspector shall take action in accordance with such decision.
(Ord. No. 83-2, 4-5-83)
Sec. 8-3. - Premises inspector designated.
There shall be a premises inspector who shall have the authority to perform the functions required by sections 8-1 and 8-2 or by resolution of the mayor and council. The premises inspector shall be responsible for making an inspection of the premises at the direction of the city clerk or the mayor and council of the city.
(Ord. No. 83-2, 4-5-83)
Sec. 8-4. - Nuisances.
(a)
Defined. A "nuisance" in general terms shall be construed to mean anything that causes hurt, inconvenience or damage to another, and the fact that the act done may otherwise be legal does not keep it from being a nuisance. The consequences complained of must not be fanciful or such as would only affect a person of fastidious tastes, but it must be such as would affect an ordinary, reasonable person. "Nuisance" as defined in this section shall be in addition to any and all other definitions of nuisances contained in the ordinances of the city.
(b)
Authority to abate. The city court shall have full power to order the abatement of any nuisance, whether public or private, within the city, and the chief of police or other police officers of the city, or the sheriff of the county or his deputies, shall have full power and authority to execute the court's order.
(c)
Complaint, notice of hearing. When any nuisance exists in the city, any person affected thereby may apply or complain to the city court or the chief of police for abatement thereof, and it shall be the duty of the court or of the chief of police to cause reasonable notice of not less than four (4) days, to the parties interested, of the time and place of hearing. The complaint shall be in writing, shall specify the acts or thing complained of, and shall be signed by the person or persons seeking the abatement. Notice of the hearing shall be in writing, shall be served upon the parties interested by the police department, and shall reasonably specify the nuisance sought to be abated. The service may be personal or may be accomplished by leaving the notice at the residences of the parties interested.
(d)
Order to abate; execution for costs. When any person shall be convicted of creating or maintaining a nuisance, he shall be ordered to abate such nuisance within a reasonable time to be fixed by the court, and should such person fail or refuse to abide by the court's order, it shall be the duty of the chief of police and the other police officers of the city to abate the same at the cost of the defendant. In any instance of failure or refusal to abate a nuisance after ordered to do so by the city court, and the abatement thereof by the police department, the cost thereof shall be collected by execution, levy and sale as in cases of taxes due the city.
(e)
Issuance of execution. The execution provided for in subsection (d) above shall be issued by the city clerk when the chief of police shall make affidavit stating the reasonable cost of abating the nuisance, and the execution shall issue for the reasonable cost or expense as shown by such affidavit.
