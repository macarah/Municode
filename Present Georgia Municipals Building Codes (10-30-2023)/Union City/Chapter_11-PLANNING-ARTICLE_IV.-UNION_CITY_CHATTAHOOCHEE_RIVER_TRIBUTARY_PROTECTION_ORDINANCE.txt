ARTICLE IV. - UNION CITY CHATTAHOOCHEE RIVER TRIBUTARY PROTECTION ORDINANCE

Sec. 11-50. - Short title.
This ordinance will be known as the "Union City Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 99-10, 4-20-99)
Sec. 11-51. - Statutory authorization.
This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the requirements of section 12-5-453 of O.C.G.A.
(Ord. No. 99-10, 4-20-99)
Sec. 11-52. - Finding and purposes.
(a)
Findings. The mayor and council of the City of Union City finds that:
(1)
The Chattahoochee River provides multiple public benefits, which include use of the river as the primary water supply for metropolitan Atlanta.
(2)
The water quality of the Chattahoochee River depends upon the water quality of the flowing streams tributary to the river.
(3)
Sediment and other polluting materials and conditions, including but not limited to pesticides, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, toxic materials, and elevations in water temperature are harmful to the water quality of the river and its tributaries.
(4)
The riparian vegetation along these watercourses helps preserve water quality. Dense tree and understory growth helps to prevent stream bank erosion, and stream-side vegetation reduces the amount of sediment and other polluting materials that would otherwise wash into streams. Riparian trees, by shading, help maintain cooler water temperatures and thus enhance water quality.
(b)
Purposes. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to minimize public and private losses due to erosion, siltation and water pollution; and to maintain stream water quality in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Create vegetative buffer areas adjacent to tributary streams in the drainage area.
(2)
Minimize land-disturbing activities within such buffer areas by requiring issuance of a permit for such activities.
(Ord. No. 99-10, 4-20-99)

Exceptions. The permit provisions of this ordinance shall not apply to:
(1)
Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. When emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report the pertinent facts relating to the work to the permits clerk of the City of Union City on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten (10) days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the permits clerk to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability, or water quality of the protection area.
(2)
Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land which is zoned and approved for such use on the date of adoption of this ordinance or March 1, 1999, whichever is earlier.
(b)
Application for a permit. A separate application for a permit shall be made to the permits clerk, on a form approved by the permits clerk, for each land-disturbing activity, except that only one application need be made for two (2) or more such acts which are to be done on the same parcel. The application shall include a map of the site and such information concerning the proposed action as the permits clerk deems necessary to describe the nature and extent of the proposed action and to determine the effect of the proposed action on the protection area.
(c)
Issuance of permit. No application for a permit shall be approved and no permit shall be issued for any land-disturbing activity within the protection area unless:
(1)
The land-disturbing activity is for the purpose of constructing one (1) of the following: a stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or public utility; a dam and/or impoundment; or
(2)
The land-disturbing activity is within a right-of-way of any public agency pursuant to a permit issued by such public agency; or

The permits clerk finds and determines that a minimum amount of land disturbance necessary for the beneficial use of the parcel has been proposed.
(d)
Conditions. In each permit issued under the provisions of this ordinance, the permits clerk shall include conditions designed to:
(1)
Limit erosion, sedimentation and water pollution within the protection zone to amounts and rates no greater than those occurring before the land-disturbing activity; and
(2)
Preserve, protect or replace the maximum feasible amount of natural vegetation.
(e)
Variance. The mayor and council of the City of Union City shall grant no variance from any provision of this ordinance without first conducting a public hearing on the application for a variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by majority vote of the full membership of the mayor and council. The mayor and council shall give public notice of each such public hearing at least two (2) weeks prior to the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of Union City.
(f)
Responsibility. Neither the issuance of a permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the provisions of this ordinance shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon the City of Union City, its officers or employees, for injury or damage to persons or property. A permit issued pursuant to this ordinance does not relieve the permittee of the responsibility of securing and complying with any other permit required by any other city ordinance or state law.
(g)
Term of permit; extension; renewal. The permittee shall complete the work authorized by the permit within the time limits specified in the permit, which in no case shall extend more than twelve (12) months from the date of issuance. The permittee shall notify the permits clerk at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the commencement of work. Should the work not be commenced and completed within the time limits, then the permit shall become void; provided, however, that if prior to the date established for commencement of work, the permittee makes written request to the permits clerk for an extension of time to commence the work, setting forth the reasons for the required extension, the permits clerk may grant such extension. A permit which has become void may be renewed at the discretion of the permits clerk.
(h)
Inspection. The permits clerk may cause inspections of the work to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work. The permittee shall assist the permits clerk in making such inspections. The city shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land-disturbing activities within a protection area. No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
(i)
Cash deposit. Prior to the issuance of any permit for land-disturbing activities within the protection area, the applicant shall submit cash, cashier's check or money order to be deposited in an escrow account which shall ensure that all terms and conditions of the permit are complied with. The cash deposit shall pertain to and recite therein an exact description of the property in question. The length of time for which the cash deposit shall be held shall be determined by the city engineer, and shall be specified in writing. The cash deposit shall be in an amount equal to twice the estimated cost for carrying out the land-disturbing activity in compliance with all terms and conditions of the permit. The sum of the cash deposit shall be made payable to the City of Union City.
