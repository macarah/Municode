In the event that the Union City Police Department, Union City Fire Department and/or other department of purview identifies a substantial public health or safety risk arising from or caused by the filming, and the producer is in material compliance with the permit, the following shall occur:
(1)
Where the substantial risk is identified prior to the commencement of the filming, the city manager and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s).

(2)
Where the substantial risk is not imminent and is identified after the commencement of the filming, the city manager and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s). Where such efforts are unsuccessful, the city manager shall modify the permit in a manner that minimizes disruption of the filming as determined at the city manager's reasonable discretion, and that eliminates the substantial risk as reasonably determined by the department of purview.
(3)
Where the substantial risk is imminent as reasonably determined by the department of purview and is identified after the commencement of filming, said department may place a stop work order on the filming if it finds that the order will likely alleviate the substantial risk. The stop work order may be issued without advance notice where the department of purview deems that a delay of the order will jeopardize public health and safety, and shall be lifted as quickly as possible after the risk is eliminated. The department of purview shall notify the city manager of the stop work order within two (2) hours of its issuance.

If the city manager and/or department of purview finds that a substantial public health or safety risk is arising from or caused by the material violation, the department of purview in consultation with the city manager may place an immediate stop work order on the filming without prior notice to the producer, and consultation with the producer shall occur after the work stoppage. The consultation between the city manager, department of purview and producer shall evaluate the nature and severity of the violation, whether the violation was intentional, whether permit modifications should be made, whether the stop work order should be lifted (where applicable), and what other actions should be taken (if any). Where the violation creates a substantial public health and/or safety risk, the remedial actions decided by the city manager will not be deemed final until the department of purview reviews the remedial actions and confirms that they will eliminate the health and safety risks.
