Sec. 13-7. - Executions on delinquent taxes and assessments.
(a)
As soon as the last day for the payment of taxes and assessments has arrived, the city clerk shall notify in writing the taxpayer of the fact that the taxes have not been paid and that, unless paid within thirty (30) days, an execution shall be issued.
(b)
The city clerk shall issue executions for the nonpayment of taxes and assessments at any time after thirty (30) days have elapsed since giving notice as provided in subsection (a) above.

Execution shall be directed to "all and singular sheriffs and constables of the state."
(c)
The city clerk shall cause all executions issued to be recorded on the General Execution Docket of the county where the property is located, in the case of real property, and, in the case of personal property, in the county of the taxpayer's residence if a resident of the state, otherwise in the county where any real or personal property of the taxpayer may be found.

In the event he is unable to do so, the Marshal shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi fa's property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this article.
(Ord. No. 98-7, § 5, 5-19-98)
Sec. 13-8. - Levy of executions; sale of property.
(a)
The director of the department of public safety is hereby designated as the Marshal of the City of Union City and delegated the duties set forth in this article. The marshal shall account for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the municipality. After first paying the city clerk the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes, else to the defendant in fi fa.
(b)
In all cases of levying on real property, five (5) days written notice of the levy prior to the levy must be given personally or delivered by certified mail to the defendant in fi fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the marshal shall enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi fa therein.
(c)
Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give twenty (20) days written notice of the levy to the record owner(s) of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The twenty-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner of the land, the year or years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the city clerk.
(d)
When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; provided, however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi fa shall be given at least ten (10) days' written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or a lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than thirty (30) days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the secretary of the treasury or his delegate not less than twenty-five (25) days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.
(e)
The marshal shall publish weekly for four (4) weeks in the official legal organ of the city an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the owner(s) of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property as being sold for collection of taxes due to the City of Union City and the year(s) for which taxes have been executed.
(f)
Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal before the City Hall on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; provided, however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sale shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the City of Union City, makes any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied.
(g)
The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or a bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or a bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this article shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi fa or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy and sale. Recitals in the deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provided, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired.
(h)
Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property sold for taxes after the property has been offered a reasonable time, the marshal may either readvertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids.
(Ord. No. 98-7, § 6, 5-19-98)
Sec. 13-9. - Bidding by city at tax sale; disposition of property acquired.
(a)
If, during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county, and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city administrator, or his or her designee, may purchase the property for the City of Union City. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city administrator. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold.
(b)
Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder; however, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided in section 13-12 of this article.
(c)
The right of redemption in real property purchased by the city at a tax sale shall be foreclosed in a manner set forth in section 13-12 of this article.
(Ord. No. 98-7, § 7, 5-19-98)
Sec. 13-10. - Accounting by marshal; final return or settlement.
(a)
The marshal shall make a prompt accounting to the city clerk for all executions placed in his hands for collection or levying for sale. He shall pay over to the clerk all amounts due the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties, and costs, and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with the disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs, and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess.
(b)
In any event, within ninety (90) days from the date executions are placed in his hands, the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectable in full, he shall so notify the city clerk in writing. It shall be the duty of the clerk to cause cancellation of executions on the General Execution Docket of the county upon their final payment or collection.
(Ord. No. 98-7, § 8, 5-19-98)
Sec. 13-11. - Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgment.
(a)
Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi fa on which to levy any tax execution in his hands, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The city clerk, in the name of the City of Union City, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he or she believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi fa or who has property, money, or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi fa. The clerk shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued.
(b)
When an execution for taxes remains unsatisfied and an entry of "nulla bona" has been duly entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately proceeding thirty-day period and the city clerk has reason to believe the defendant in fi fa may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state, the clerk, in the name of the City of Union City, may petition the Superior Court of the county in this state in which the defendant in fi fa maintains a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi fa does not maintain a known residence in this state, the action may be brought in the county where the tax obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with Chapter 3 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
(Ord. No. 98-7, § 9, 5-19-98)
Sec. 13-12. - Redemption rights of defendant in fi fa; vesting of title in grantee.
(a)
Whenever real property is sold for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi fa or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A. section 48-4-42, at any time within twelve (12) months from the date of sale, and at any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. section 48-4-45, which code sections by reference are incorporated herein as a part of this article.
(b)
Where notice of foreclosure of the right to redeem real property sold at a tax sale has not been given as required in subsection (a) above, title shall ripen by prescription after a period of four (4) years from the date of recording of the deed in the county where the property is situated, provided the defendant in fi fa was not laboring under any legal disability at the time of sale. Unless the tax deed indicates a lesser interest was levied upon and sold, a fee simple title to the property shall vest absolutely in the grantee in the deed or in the grantee's heirs or assigns. In the event the defendant in fi fa is laboring under any legal disability, the prescriptive term shall begin from the time the disabilities are removed or abated.
(Ord. No. 98-7, § 10, 5-19-98)
Sec. 13-13. - Costs.
(a)
For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the Clerk of Superior Court for recording and cancellation of the tax fi fa.
