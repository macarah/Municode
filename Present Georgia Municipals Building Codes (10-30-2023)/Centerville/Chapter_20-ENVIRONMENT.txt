Sec. 20-21. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the city, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Code 1992, § 8-2; Ord. No. 2007-5, art. 1, § B, 10-16-2007)
Sec. 20-22. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(5)

(10)
Changes to noncompliant structures. Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this article shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
(Code 1992, § 8-55; Ord. No. 2007-5, art. 4, § A, 10-16-2007)
Sec. 20-77. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
(1)
New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 20-76(4), pertaining to elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, including ductwork, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation.
(2)
Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this subsection and in section 20-51(6).
(3)
Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
a.
All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on:
1.
Individual lots or parcels;
2.
In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
3.
In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
4.
On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood;
must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
b.
Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either:
1.
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
2.
The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers, or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
c.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (See section 20-77(6).)
d.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
1.
Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
2.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
3.
The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)c of this section.
(4)
Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 20-25 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
b.

DIVISION 4. - VARIANCES

Sec. 20-106. - Procedures.
(a)
The board of zoning appeals as established by the city council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article.
(b)
The board shall hear and make recommendations on appeals to the city council who shall then decide on the appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the article administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council's adoption, rejection, or modification of the board of zoning appeals may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing and making recommendations to the city council on such requests, the board of zoning appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(h)
Conditions for variances are as follows:
(1)
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
a.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(2)
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The article administrator and/or city clerk shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this article, the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to its recommendation in favor of granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

Sec. 20-128. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/ BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with section (b)(2) below or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c)(15)—(17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section;
(15)
Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) and (17) of this section, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(17)
There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction.
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
c.
The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
d.
Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in [EPD Rule] 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
(e)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city clerk and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 20-128(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7.10.
(3)
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) and (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(4)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 20-128(c)(15)—(17), have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.

(a)
The director of operations or his designee will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.
(b)
The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
(c)
The director of operations or his designee shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
(d)
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
(e)
The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found.
(f)
The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority.

The minimum lot sizes in this subsection (a)(3) are for the typical size home (four bedrooms) with basic appurtenances such as driveway, minimum number of trees, and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed to be constructed or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the county board of health will require larger lots to ensure useable soil area.
c.
The county board of health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features.
d.
Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively.
e.
The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads, easements, such as power line or pipe line, that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors.
f.
There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system. This will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent city zoning setbacks and/or other city or county space requirements must also be met.
g.
The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by a nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by a public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Examples:
1.
Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine X = the square footage of the lot needed, use the following formula:
EXPAND
X = 5,000 gal/day/1,200 gal/day>
= 4.17 acres
= 4.17 acres × 43,560 sq. ft./acre
= 181,500 sq. ft. area of land needed
  2.
Assume a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine Y = the square footage of the lot needed for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula:
EXPAND
Y = 5,000 gal/day/600 gal/day>
= 8.33 acres
= 8.33 acres × 43,560 sq. ft./acre
= 363,000 sq. ft. area of land needed
  (b)

ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER DESIGN STANDARDS

Sec. 20-175. - Local design manual.
(a)
Forward. The local design manual (LDM) is meant to serve as a comprehensive guide to implementing stormwater management systems in the city. Additionally, the LDM is designed to supplement the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM) and all subsequent updates or revisions, which shall serve as the technical manual for design and specification of individual components within the system.
(b)
General level of service standards.
(1)
Detention requirements.
a.
Discharge rates from new development projects. Development plans, including site grading and drainage plans, should be developed to minimize disruption of natural drainage patterns on properties as well as to minimize impacts to downstream drainage infrastructure and structures. Whenever a hydrologic and hydraulic report, as defined in subsection (f) of this section, indicates a potentially adverse impact resulting from development of a property, that project shall incorporate stormwater detention facilities as outlined herein. The meaning of adverse impact shall apply to situations where the post-development discharge rates, up to and including the 100-year storm event, exceed those determined for the predeveloped conditions, or where downstream conditions indicate that the conveyance and/or storage capacity of the existing infrastructure could be inundated by the post-development conditions, or where existing structures could be impacted by the postdeveloped conditions. Additionally, no increases in stormwater runoff rates shall be allowed at any discharge point on the site. The baseline or predeveloped conditions shall be a wooded undisturbed site regardless of whether any clearing has occurred in the past and shall model any depression storage and/or detention storage. The development shall be analyzed for the following storm events:
1.
Two-year 24-hour design storm;
2.
Five-year 24-hour design storm;
3.
Ten-year 24-hour design storm;
4.
25-year 24-hour design storm;
5.
50-year 24-hour design storm;
6.
100-year 24-hour design storm.
If the total area of the site (i.e., total property area) and the drainage area to each stormwater management facility is less than one acre, then a rainfall intensity based analysis (i.e., rational method) may be performed. If detention facilities are to be designed and constructed in series, the 24-hour storm criteria will apply regardless of the drainage area.
b.
Discharge rates from redevelopment projects. Development plans, including site grading and drainage plans, should be developed to minimize disruption of natural drainage patterns on properties as well as to minimize impacts to downstream drainage infrastructure and structures. Whenever a hydrologic and hydraulic report, as defined in subsection (f) of this section, indicates a potentially adverse impact resulting from development of a property, that project shall incorporate stormwater detention facilities as outlined herein. The meaning of adverse impact shall apply to situations where the post-development discharge rates, up to and including the 100-year storm event, exceed those determined for the predeveloped conditions, or where downstream conditions indicate that the conveyance and/or storage capacity of the existing infrastructure could be inundated by the post-development conditions, or where existing structures could be impacted by the post-developed conditions. Additionally, no increases in stormwater runoff rates shall be allowed at any discharge point on the site. The baseline or predeveloped conditions shall be based on an analysis of the stormwater discharge rates from the site in its existing condition and shall model any depression storage and/or detention storage. The development shall be analyzed for the following storm events:
1.
Two-year 24-hour design storm;
2.
Five-year 24-hour design storm;
3.
Ten-year 24-hour design storm;
4.
25-year 24-hour design storm;
5.
50-year 24-hour design storm;
6.
100-year 24-hour design storm.
If the total area of the site (i.e., total property area) and the drainage area to each stormwater management facility is less than one acre, then a rainfall intensity based analysis (i.e., rational method) may be performed. If detention facilities are to be designed and constructed in series, the 24-hour storm criteria will apply regardless of the drainage area.
(2)
Conveyance systems.
a.
Bridges. All bridges shall be designed to accommodate the 100-year 24-hour design storm with no over topping.
b.
Culverts and pipe systems.
EXPAND
Roadway Classification/Use Design Storm
Arterial/emergency evacuation roadway 100-year
Collector roads 50-year
Neighborhood roads 25-year
Roads with no other outlet 100-year
Parking lots/material storage areas/landscape areas 10-year
  Culverts with contributing drainage areas greater than ten acres shall be designed to the 24-hour storm. For example, if a cross drain is to be designed to convey stormwater runoff from a 20-acre drainage basin under a neighborhood road, then the design storm shall be a 25-year 24-hour storm. If a culvert is designed to connect to an existing system of a differing design level of service, then the system with the greater design requirement will be used to size the proposed system.
c.
Inlets (catchbasins, yard inlets, drop inlets, hooded grate inlets and flumes). Inlets collecting stormwater runoff from street surfaces and area inlets shall be sized to capture the storm event specified for the pipe system to which it drains and a maximum flooding depth as determined by the following table:
EXPAND
Roadway Classification/Use Flooding Depth
Arterial/emergency evacuation roadway 8.0 feet maximum gutter spread
Collector roads 8.0 feet maximum gutter spread
Neighborhood roads 8.0 feet lane width open
Roads with no other outlet One lane width open
Parking lots Maximum 0.5 feet depth
Detention areas utilized for other purposes (i.e., parking lot detention, etc.) with flood warning sign Maximum 1.5 feet depth
Material storage areas/landscape areas with flood warning sign if area is utilized by the public Maximum 2.0 feet depth
  Inlets and grading adjacent to habitable structures shall be designed to prevent stormwater runoff from entering the structure during the 100-year design storm.
d.
Inlets (headwalls, flared end sections, etc.). Inlets that utilize the opening of the pipe as the inlet (i.e., headwalls, flared end sections, etc.) shall be sized to capture the storm event specified for the pipe system to which it drains and a maximum flooding depth that will not result in bypass of the inlet or cause structural/nuisance flooding.
e.
Roadside ditches. Roads constructed without curb and gutter shall incorporate ditches that are designed to the specific design storms as shown in the following table:
EXPAND
Roadway Classification/Use Design Storm
Arterial/emergency evacuation roadway 100-year
Collector roads 50-year
Neighborhood roads 25-year
Roads with no other outlet 100-year
  f.
Drainage channels. For drainage channels designed to convey stormwater runoff either from or to a culvert, the channel should be sized to accommodate the same storm event specified for the pipe system. Channels designed to convey stormwater runoff to detention ponds shall be sized to accommodate the 100-year design storm.
(3)
Water quality treatment.
a.
Water quality in new development. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. Stormwater management systems must be designed to remove 80 percent of the average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load and be able to meet any other additional watershed or site-specific water quality requirements. It is presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this performance standard if:
1.
It is sized to capture and treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume, which is defined as the runoff volume resulting from the first 1 2/10 inches of rainfall from a site.
2.
Appropriate structural controls are selected, designed, constructed, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the local design manual and the GSMM.
3.
Additional water quality requirements may be specified for hotspot land uses and activities.
b.
Water quality in redevelopment. All stormwater runoff generated from the disturbed area of the site shall be adequately treated before discharge. Stormwater management systems must be designed to remove 80 percent of the average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load and be able to meet any other additional watershed or site-specific water quality requirements. It is presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this performance standard if:
1.
It is sized to capture and treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume, which is defined as the runoff volume resulting from the first 1 2/10 inches of rainfall from a site.
2.
Appropriate structural controls are selected, designed, constructed, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the local design manual and the GSMM.
3.
Additional water quality requirements may be specified for hotspot land uses and activities.
(4)
Channel protection.
a.
Channel protection for new development projects. Channel protection shall be provided for each site by providing extended detention of the one-year storm event released over a period of 24 hours.
b.
Channel protection for redevelopment projects. Channel protection shall be provided for the disturbed portion of each site by providing extended detention of the one-year storm event released over a period of 24 hours.
(5)
Energy dissipation. Energy dissipation shall be employed whenever the velocity of flows leaving a new stormwater facility exceeds the erosion velocity of the downstream area channel area or five fps (feet per second) whichever is less.
(c)
Approved construction materials and BMPs.
(1)

All CMP pipes shall be galvanized with a minimum of four ounces of galvanization per square foot and be 14 gauge or heavier construction. Those areas where a high groundwater table exists and/or soil corrosivity and resistivity do not meet the manufacturer's recommendation for a 50-year service life, only RCP may be utilized. The city may, at its discretion, require soil tests to be provided at the owner's expense to determine corrosivity and resistivity of the soils as well as the presence and depth of the groundwater table. All soil tests performed by the owner must be performed in strict conformance with pipe manufacturer's specifications. Maximum deflection of installed pipe systems shall be in accordance with manufacturer's specifications.
b.
Other pipe systems. All other pipe systems not under roadways shall be constructed of RCP, HDPE, or CMP meeting state department of transportation standards and approved by the city. Minimum bedding standards for HDPE and CMP pipe shall be such that stone bedding (i.e., No. 57 stone) shall be placed to half of the pipe diameter for all depths greater than four feet and/or in accordance with manufacturer's specifications, whichever is greater. All pipes must have a minimum of 12 inches of cover from the crown of the pipe, and in accordance with manufacturer's specifications, provided the owner and/or designer coordinates easement requirements with the city in advance. All CMP pipes shall be galvanized with a minimum of four ounces of galvanization per square foot, and have three-inch by one-inch corrugation for pipe sizes of 36 inches in diameter and larger, and be 14 gauge or heavier construction. Those areas where a high groundwater table exists and/or soil corrosivity and resistivity do not meet manufacturer's recommendations for a 50-year service life, only RCP may be utilized. The city may, at its discretion, require soil tests to be provided at the owner's expense to determine corrosivity and resistivity of the soils as well as the presence and depth of the groundwater table. All soil tests performed by the owner must be performed in strict conformance with pipe manufacturer's specifications. Maximum deflection of installed pipe systems shall be in accordance with manufacturer's specifications.

ARTICLE VI. - WATER RESOURCE DISTRICTS

Sec. 20-206. - Purpose.
The intent of this article is to establish minimum development standards and criteria which will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout the city. It has been determined the wise management of these resources as defined in this article is essential to maintaining the health, safety, general welfare and economic well-being of the public.
(Code 1992, § 9.5-31; Ord. No. 2001-10, § 1, 9-21-2001)
Sec. 20-207. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Document EPA-600-87-035 (Note. The drastic methodology is most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility).
Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for the city.
Jurisdictional wetland means an area that needs the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended.
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area.
Pollution susceptibility map means the relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources using the drastic methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia.)
Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
Regulated activity means any activity which will or which may reasonably be expected to result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended.
Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition).
Water resource district means a map overlay which imposes a set of requirements in addition to those of the underlying zoning district.
Wetlands means those areas inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. The term "wetlands" generally includes swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation and hydrological conditions involving a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.
(Code 1992, § 9.5-33; Ord. No. 2001-10, § 3, 9-21-2001)
Sec. 20-208. - Establishment of water resource districts.
(a)
The city's water resource districts shall include the following:
(1)
Groundwater recharge area district.
(2)
Wetlands protection district.
(b)
The boundaries of these water resource districts are shown on a set of maps designated as water resource districts and are included as part of the city's official zoning map, which is on file with the zoning administrator's office located in the city hall.
(Code 1992, § 9.5-32; Ord. No. 2001-10, § 2, 9-21-2001)
Sec. 20-209. - Groundwater recharge area district.
(a)
Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides, sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.
(c)
District delineation. The groundwater recharge area district is delineated according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 edition.

  1 In this context, the term "nonpublic" means an individual water supply system or any other water supply system which is not a public water supply system.
2 Gpad equals gallons per acre per day or gal/acre/day.
(1)
The minimum lot sizes in the tables in this subsection (e) are for the typical size home (three-bedroom or four-bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed for construction or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the county board of health will require larger lots to ensure usable soil area.
(2)
The county board of health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features.
(3)
Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively.
(4)
The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size:
a.
Rights-of-way of roads;
b.
Easements, such as power lines or pipe lines, that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system;
c.
Bodies of water;
d.
Land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors.
(5)
There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent county zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met.
(6)
The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. An example follows:
a.
Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine the square footage of the lot needed "X," use the following formula:
EXPAND
X = 5,000 gal/day 1,200 gal/acre/day
= 4.17 acres
= 4.17 acres × 43,560 feet 2 /acre
= 181,500 feet 2 area of land needed
  b.
Assume a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine the square footage of the lot needed "Y," for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula:
EXPAND
Y = 5,000 gal/day 600 gal/acre/day
= 8.33 acres
= 8.33 acres × 43,560 feet 2 / acre
= 363,000 feet 2 area of land needed

Sec. 20-210. - Wetlands protection district.
(a)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constrains due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide:
(1)
Habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation;
(2)
Water quality maintenance and pollution control;
(3)
Flood control;
(4)
Natural resource education;
(5)
Scientific study; and
(6)
Recreational opportunities.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas.
(c)
District delineation. The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon as attached thereto. The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands with the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC § 1344, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(d)
Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use except those identified in subsection (e) of this section shall be allowed within the wetland protection district without a development permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary as determined by the zoning enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
(e)
Permitted uses. The uses in this subsection are permitted by right within the wetland protection district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging as provided herein. (The activities listed in this subsection are exempt from section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 USC 401 et seq., a permit may be required in some circumstances.)
(1)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended.
(2)
Conservation or preservation soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(3)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(4)
The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture.

ARTICLE VII. - WATER RESOURCE PROTECTION

Sec. 20-229. - General provisions.
(a)
Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Land development and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;
(2)
This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants; and
(3)
Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites.
Therefore, the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This article seeks to meet that purpose through regulation of activities that can, through proper regulation, improve and maintain those water resources that lie partially or wholly within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city.
(c)
Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements. This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
(d)
Responsibility for administration. Unless otherwise stated, the city inspections department (hereinafter referred to as the inspections department) shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the city governing authority may be delegated by the inspections department to persons or entities acting under the authority of the city.
(e)
Effects of compliance. The standards set forth herein pursuant to this article unless otherwise noted are minimum standards; therefore, this article does not intend nor imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no adverse effect with regard to water quality and quantity.

(4)
Discharge permits from regulatory agencies other than the city. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. BMPs designated for compliance with the NPDES permit or BMPs implemented as a result of action taken in compliance of this section shall be included in a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(f)
Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
(g)
Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the MS4 or watercourses, or water of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the inspections department in person, by phone, facsimile or email no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the inspections department within three business days of the phone notice. The notification of the discharge of materials to the inspections department shall be in addition to notification of other applicable city, regional, state and federal authorities. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
(h)

Cost of abatement of the violation. Within 30 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within 30 days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the reviewing authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment.
(5)
Injunctive relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this section. If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this section, the inspections department may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
(6)
Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this article, the city may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
(7)
Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this section is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
(8)
Criminal prosecution. Any person who has violated or continues to violate this section shall be liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, and shall be subject to a criminal penalty of $2,500.00 per violation per day. The city may recover all attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement of this article, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
(9)

(Code 1992, § 9.5-43; Ord. No. 2005-20, art. III, §§ 1—8, 12-6-2005; Ord. No. 2006-11, § A.4., 1-10-2006)
Sec. 20-232. - Post-construction stormwater runoff.
(a)
General provisions.
(1)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This section seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
a.
Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream and drainage channels;
b.
Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
c.
Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and
d.
Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety.
(2)
Applicability. This section shall be applicable to all development plan applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the inspections department under the specifications of subsection (a)(3) of this section. This section also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules.
a.
New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that disturbs one acre or more of land;
b.
Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more;
c.
Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the inspections department to be a hotspot land use; or
d.
Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in subsections (a)(2)a and b of this section if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules.
e.
Any development project regardless of size deemed by the inspections department that shall contribute to a known or suspected water quality or quantity impairment.
(3)
Exempt activities. The following activities are exempt from this section:
a.
Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project;
b.
Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures;
c.
Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and
d.
Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the inspections department.
When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment project as defined in section 20-230, decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be governed by special stormwater sizing criteria found in the current local stormwater design manual (LDM) on file in the office of the utilities superintendent. This criteria is dependent on the amount of impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the inspections department.
(4)
Development of a local stormwater design manual (LDM). The city may furnish additional policy, criteria and information including specifications and standards, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article and will provide such information in the form of an LDM. The LDM will serve to supplement and/or clarify information set forth in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. The LDM a copy of which is on file in the office of the city clerk, will include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. The manual may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the city, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards during the design and permitting phase of a land development project.
(b)
Permit procedures and requirements.
(1)
Permit required. No landowner or land operator shall receive any of the building, grading or other land development permits required for land-disturbance activities without first meeting the requirements of this section prior to commencing the proposed activity.
(2)
Application requirements. Unless specifically excluded by this section, any landowner or operator desiring a permit for a land-disturbance activity shall submit to the city a permit application on a form provided for that purpose. Unless otherwise excepted by this section, a permit application must include the minimum requirements as defined in this article or LDM in order for the permit application to be considered.
(3)
Application review fees. The city may require the submittal of a review fee for review of the stormwater management plan, as provided in the city fee schedule in chapter 22. This review fee shall be based on the amount of land to be disturbed at the site. Fees charged for review of the submitted stormwater management plan shall include, but not be limited to, the fees charged the city by their designated engineer for such review. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to a local budgetary category to support local plan review, inspection and program administration, and all fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of any development permits.
(4)
Application procedure. All applications received by the city will be received and processed in the manner outlined in chapter 66.
(5)
Permit duration. Permits issued under this section shall be valid from the date of issuance through the date the inspections department notifies the permit holder that all stormwater management practices have passed the final inspection required under permit condition. Should no activity take place on the site, the permit shall expire within one year of issuance.
(c)
Waivers to stormwater management requirements.
(1)
Waivers for providing stormwater management. Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by this section, unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement. Requests to waive the stormwater management plan requirements shall be submitted to the inspections department for approval. The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions apply or the applicant presents sufficient engineering data and analysis to support his request for a waiver as determined by the local jurisdiction:
a.
It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this article.
b.
Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been approved by the inspections department and local ordinance, or some other legally enforceable document, that requires the implementation of the plan.
c.
Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for longterm operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice.
d.
The inspections department finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of a site.
e.
Nonstructural practices will be used on the site that reduce:
1.
The generation of stormwater from the site;
2.
The size and cost of stormwater storage; and
3.
The pollutants generated at the site.
These nonstructural practices shall be explained in detail in the local or state design manual and the amount of credit available for using such practices shall be determined by the inspections department.
(2)
Conditions of waiver. In instances where one of the conditions of subsection (c)(1) of this section applies, the inspections department may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these stormwater management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the inspections department that the waiver will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways:
a.
Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures;
b.
Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
c.
Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation; and
d.
Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and property.
(3)
Mitigation requirements for waivers. Where compliance with minimum requirements for stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the inspections department. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:
a.
The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat.
b.
The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and standards of this article.
c.
Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund stormwater management activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates, stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic studies, and monitoring of stormwater management practices, etc.).
(4)
Fee in lieu of stormwater management practices. Where the inspections department waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed development, the applicant may be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the inspections department. When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater management, the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a fee schedule (unless the developer and the inspections department agree on a greater alternate contribution) established by the city council. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements program project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any development permits.
(5)
Dedication of land. In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a waiver of the required stormwater management by entering into an agreement with the city for the granting of an easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-site stormwater management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the city prior to the recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the development permits.
(d)
General performance criteria for stormwater management. Unless judged by the inspections department to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites:
(1)
All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize previous areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity.
(2)
All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not discharge untreated stormwater directly into a state water without adequate control of stormwater runoff. Where such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method acceptable to the inspections department. In no case shall the impact on functional values be any less than allowed by the Army Corp of Engineers (ACE) or the state department of natural resources.
(3)
Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained to the maximum extent practical, by promoting infiltration through the use of structural and nonstructural methods where allowable.
(4)
For new development, stormwater treatment practices shall be designed to remove pollutants to levels prescribed in the current LDM, a copy of which is on file in the office of the utilities superintendent. It is presumed that a BMP complies with this performance standard if it is:
a.
Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQ);
b.
Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in the LDM;
c.
Constructed properly; and
d.
Maintained regularly.
(5)
To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the current LDM on file in the office of the utilities superintendent.
(6)
Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (i.e., fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas, etc.) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices.
(7)
Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit. The stormwater pollution prevention plan requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites.
(8)
Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential pollutant loadings, known as hotspots, may require the use of specific structural stormwater treatment practices (STPs) and pollution prevention practices.
(9)
Prior to design, applicants are encouraged to consult with the inspections department to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements.
(10)
The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the LDM shall be used for sizing all stormwater management practices.
(e)
Basic stormwater management design criteria.
(1)
Minimum control requirements. All stormwater management practices will be designed so that the specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g., recharge, water quality, channel protection, ten-year, and 100-year) as identified in the LDM are met, unless the inspections department grants the applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the inspections department reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
(2)
Site design feasibility. Stormwater management practices for a site shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Applicants shall consult the current LDM for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a stormwater management practice.
(3)
Conveyance issues. All stormwater management practices shall be designed to convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. The current LDM, a copy of which is on file in the office of the utilities superintendent, shall provide detailed guidance on the requirements for conveyance for each of the approved stormwater management practices.
(4)
Landscaping plans required. All stormwater management practices that utilize wetlands vegetation as part of the functional treatment process (e.g., constructed wetlands, etc.) must submit a separate landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the practice and how and who will manage and maintain this vegetation. This plan must be prepared by an individual having a professional certification by the Society of Wetlands Scientists and has completed three projects of a similar nature that have been successfully implemented or equivalent qualifications as determined by the inspections department.
(5)
Maintenance agreements. All stormwater treatment practices shall have an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed. This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and inspect the stormwater treatment practices, and to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater treatment practice. In addition, a legally binding covenant specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all stormwater treatment practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land-disturbance activities. An example of the covenant can be found in the LDM, a copy of which is on file in the office of the utilities superintendent.
(6)
Nonstructural stormwater practices. The use of nonstructural stormwater treatment practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance on structural practices. Credit in the form of reductions in the amount of stormwater that must be managed can be earned through the use of nonstructural practices that reduce the generation of stormwater from the site. These nonstructural practices are explained in detail in the current LDM, a copy of which is on file in the office of the utilities superintendent, and applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of nonstructural practices must ensure that these practices are documented and remain unaltered by subsequent property owners.
(f)
Requirements for stormwater management plan approval.
(1)
Stormwater management plan required for all developments. No application for development will be approved unless it includes a stormwater management plan detailing in concept how runoff and associated water quality impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or managed. This plan must be certified by a professional engineer licensed in the state and/or registered land surveyor licensed in the state and must indicate whether stormwater will be managed on site or off site and if on site, the general location and type of practices. The stormwater management plans shall be referred for comment to all other interested agencies, and any comments must be addressed in a final stormwater management plan. This final plan must be signed by a professional engineer and or a registered land surveyor licensed in the state, who will verify that the design of all stormwater management practices meet the submittal requirements outlined in the submittal checklist found in the current LDM. No development permits shall be issued until a satisfactory final stormwater management plan, or a waiver thereof, shall have undergone a review and been approved by the inspections department after determining that the plan or waiver is consistent with the requirements of this article.
(2)
Stormwater management plan requirements. A stormwater management plan shall be required with all land-disturbance activity (LDA) permit applications and will include sufficient information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.) to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site (both present and future) on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site. The intent of this planning process is to determine the type of stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed project, and ensure adequate planning for management of stormwater runoff from future development. To accomplish this goal the applicant will prepare a design report which shall include elements sufficient to ensure compliance with this section as outlined in the current LDM, a copy of which is on file in the office of the utilities superintendent. The inspections department reserves the right to extend these requirements to ensure compliance with this section if the requirements in the current LDM prove to be insufficient. However, in these cases, the inspections department must provide a written explanation of the additional elements needed to the applicant.
(3)
Performance bond/security. The city may, at its discretion, require the submittal of a performance security or bond in order to ensure that the stormwater practices are installed by the permit holder as required by the approved stormwater management plan. The amount of the installation performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the stormwater management practices approved under the permit, plus 25 percent as agreed to by the applicant and the city. The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure to complete work specified in the stormwater management plan. The installation performance security shall be released in full only upon submission of as-built plans and written certification by a professional engineer and or a registered land surveyor licensed in the state and/or registered land surveyor licensed in the state that the stormwater practice will function in accordance with the approved plan and other applicable provisions of this section. The inspections department will make a final inspection of the stormwater practice to ensure that it is in compliance with the approved plan and the provisions of this section. Provisions for a partial pro-rata release of the performance security based on the completion of various development stages may be done at the discretion of the inspections department.
(g)
Construction inspection.
(1)
Notice of construction commencement. The applicant must notify the city's designated engineer and the city inspections department in advance before the commencement of construction. If any violations are found, the property owner shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. No added work shall proceed until any violations are corrected and all work previously completed has received approval by agreement of the city's designated engineer and city inspections department.
(2)
As-built plans. All applicants are required to submit actual as-built plans for any stormwater management practices located both on site and off site after final construction is completed in a format specified in the current LDM, a copy of which is on file in the office of the utilities superintendent. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer licensed in the state. A final inspection by the city's designated engineer is required before the release of any performance securities can occur.
(3)
Landscaping and stabilization requirements. Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared or removed by development activities shall be revegetated within ten days from the substantial completion of such clearing and construction. The following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts:
a.
Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established over 90 percent of the seeded area.
b.
Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable of controlling erosion.
c.
Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of 75 percent of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the minimum 75 percent survival for one year is achieved.
In addition to the requirements of this subsection (g), a landscaping plan must be submitted with the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and management techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed in accordance with other such requirements in this Code. This plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized after construction, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved.
(h)
Maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities.
(1)
Maintenance easement. Prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy or final plat that has a stormwater management facility as part of the project, the applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the inspections department, or their contractor or agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this article.
(2)
Maintenance covenants. Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by the inspections department and the city council and recorded into the final plat prior to final approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled cleanouts. The city, in lieu of a maintenance covenant, may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this article and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance.
(3)
Requirements for maintenance covenants. Stormwater management facilities may be required to undergo annual inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this article and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include:
a.
Removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catchbasins, inlets and drainage pipes;
b.
Grass cutting and vegetation removal; and
c.
Necessary replacement of landscape vegetation.
Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a timely manner, as determined by the inspections department, and the inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management facility. The requirement for such inspections shall be outlined in the maintenance covenant.
(4)
