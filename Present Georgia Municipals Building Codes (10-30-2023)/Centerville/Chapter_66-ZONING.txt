ARTICLE VII. - HEIGHT OBSTRUCTIONS REGULATIONS

Sec. 66-178. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Approach-departure surface means the symmetrical surface about the Robins Air Force Base runway centerline extended, begins as in inclined plane (glide angle) 200 feet beyond each end of the primary surface to the centerline elevation of the runway end, and extends for 50,000 feet. The slope of the approach-departure clearance surface is 50:1 (one foot change in elevation for each 50 feet in distance from the starting point) along the extended runway (glide angle) centerline until it reaches an elevation of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation. It then continues horizontally at this elevation to a point at 50,000 feet from the start of the glide angle. The width of this surface at the runway end is 2,000 feet. It then flares uniformly, with an end width of 16,000 feet at a distance 50,000 feet from both starting points.
Conical surface means the inclined surface extending outward and upward from the outer periphery of the inner horizontal surface for a horizontal distance of 7,000 feet. The slope of the conical surface is 20:1 (one foot change in elevation for each 20 feet in distance from the starting point) with an inner elevation of 150 feet above the established airfield elevation and an outer elevation of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation.
Clear zone surface means the surface limits of the obstruction clearance requirements in the vicinity contiguous to the end of the primary surface. The length and width for a single runway of a clear zone surface is 3,000 feet by 3,000 feet.
Established airfield elevation means the altitude, measured in feet above mean sea level (MSL), of the Robins Air Force Base main runway surface. This elevation is hereby declared to be 295 feet MSL.
Height means the true highest altitude of a structure or natural feature, including trees, protruding rocks or natural ground surface, as measured in feet above mean sea level.
Inner horizontal surface means the surface plane, oval in shape, that extends 7,500 feet from Robins Air Force Base airfield runway centerline at a height of 150 feet above the established airfield elevation.
Obstruction means any structure or natural feature, including trees, protruding rocks or natural ground surface, which exceeds the height limitation of as defined by the primary surface, clear zone surface, approach-departure clearance surfaces, inner horizontal surface, conical surface, outer horizontal surface or transitional surfaces established for Robins Air Force Base.
Outer horizontal surface means the horizontal surface plane that begins at the outer edge of the conical surface and extends for 30,000 feet at a height of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation.
Primary surface means the surface limits of the obstruction clearance requirements in the immediate vicinity of the landing area. The primary surface comprises surfaces of the runway, runway shoulders, and lateral safety zones and extends 200 feet beyond the runway end. The width of the primary surface for the Robins Air Force Base runway is 2,000 feet or 1,000 feet on each side of the runway centerline.
Structure means any stationary or mobile object constructed or installed by man, including, without limitation, buildings, towers, cranes, smoke stacks, earth formations and overhead transmission lines.
Transitional surfaces means the surfaces that connect the primary surfaces, clear zone surfaces and approach-departure clearance to the outer horizontal surface, conical surface and other horizontal or transitional surfaces. The slope of the transitional surface is 7:1 (one foot in elevation for each seven feet in distance from the starting point) outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline extended.

All zones in the city shall conform with the regulations in this article.
(Code 1992, app. A, art. VII(intro.))
Sec. 66-180. - Statement of intent.
The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the construction of objects which, because of their height, illumination or reflectivity, electrical emissions, and/or air emissions, represent an obstruction or safety hazard to air traffic operating in and out of Robins Air Force Base.
(Code 1992, app. A, § 181; Ord. No. 94-2, 1-4-1994)
Sec. 66-181. - Application.
These regulations shall apply to all lands within the city that are overlaid by the primary surface, clear zone surface, approach-departure clearance surfaces, inner horizontal surface, conical surface, outer horizontal surface or transitional surfaces established for Robins Air Force Base.
