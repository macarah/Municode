II pertained to post development stormwater management for new development and redevelopment and derived from Ord. No. 0510, § 1, adopted Nov. 21, 2005.

Sec. 20-61. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-construction stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. Proper management of post-construction stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. Additionally, the City of Avondale Estates is required to comply with several state and federal laws, regulations and permits and the requirements of the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District's regional water plan related to managing the water quantity, velocity, and quality of post-construction stormwater runoff.

Design of stormwater management system: The design of the stormwater management system shall be in accordance with the applicable sections of the GSMM as directed by the administrator. Any design which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.
(2)
Natural resources inventory: Site reconnaissance and surveying techniques shall be used to complete a thorough assessment of existing natural resources, both terrestrial and aquatic, found on the site. Resources to be identified, mapped, and shown on the stormwater management plan, shall include, at a minimum (as applicable):
a.
Topography (minimum of two-foot contours) and steep slopes (i.e., areas with slopes greater than fifteen (15) percent),
b.
Natural drainage divides and patterns,
c.
Natural drainage features (e.g., swales, basins, depressional areas),
d.
Natural feature protection and conservation areas such as wetlands, lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers, drinking water wellhead protection areas and river corridors,
e.
Predominant soils (including erodible soils and karst areas), and
f.
Existing predominant vegetation including trees, high quality habitat and other existing vegetation.
(3)
Better site design practices for stormwater management: Stormwater management plans shall preserve the natural drainage and natural treatment systems and reduce the generation of additional stormwater runoff and pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. Additional details can be found in the GSMM Section 2.3.
(4)
Stormwater runoff quality/reduction: Stormwater runoff quality/reduction shall be provided by using the following:
a.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted before January 1, 2021 the applicant may choose either 1. Runoff reduction or 2. Water quality.
b.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted on or after January 1, 2021, the applicant shall choose 1. Runoff reduction and additional water quality shall not be required. To the extent 1. Runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy, then 2. Water quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a one point two (1.2) inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least eighty (80) percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
1.
Runoff reduction—The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first one point zero (1.0) inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
2.
Water quality—The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least eighty (80) percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a one point two (1.2) inch rainfall event.
c.
If a site is determined to be a hotspot as detailed in section 20-65, the City of Avondale Estates may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
(5)
Stream channel protection: Stream channel protection shall be provided by using all of the following three (3) approaches:
a.
Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one (1) year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event;
b.
Erosion prevention measures, such as energy dissipation and velocity control; and
c.
Preservation of any applicable stream buffer.

Overbank flood protection: Downstream overbank flood protection shall be provided by controlling the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour storm event.
(7)
Extreme flood protection: Extreme flood protection shall be provided by controlling the one hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(8)
Downstream analysis: Due to peak flow timing and runoff volume effects, some structural components of the stormwater management system fail to reduce discharge peaks to pre-development levels downstream from the site. A downstream peak flow analysis shall be provided to the point in the watershed downstream of the site or the stormwater management system where the area of the site comprises ten (10) percent of the total drainage area in accordance with Section 3.1.9 of the GSMM. This is to help ensure that there are minimal downstream impacts from development on the site. The downstream analysis may result in the need to resize structural components of the stormwater management system.
(9)
Stormwater management system inspection and maintenance: The components of the stormwater management system that will not be dedicated to and accepted by the [the City of] Avondale Estates, including all drainage facilities, best management practices, credited conservation spaces, and conveyance systems, shall have an inspection and maintenance agreement to ensure that they continue to function as designed. All new development and redevelopment sites are to prepare a comprehensive inspection and maintenance agreement for the on-site stormwater management system.

Sec. 20-78. - Owner's failure to maintain the stormwater management system.
The terms of the inspection and maintenance agreement shall provide for what constitutes a failure to maintain a stormwater management system and the enforcement options available to the city. If a site was developed before the requirement to have an inspection and maintenance agreement or an inspection and maintenance agreement was for any reason not entered into, recorded, or has otherwise been invalidated or deemed insufficient, then:
(1)
An owner's failure to maintain the stormwater management system so that it performs as it was originally designed shall constitute and be addressed as a violation of, or failure to comply with, owner's property maintenance obligations pursuant to chapter 4, article IV of the City Code.
(2)
To address such a failure to maintain the stormwater management system, the City of Avondale Estates shall have all the powers and remedies that are available to it for other violations of an owner's property maintenance obligations, including without limitation prosecution, penalties, abatement, and emergency measures.
