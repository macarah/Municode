Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on a historic property to correct deterioration, decay or damage, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, shall not require a certificate of appropriateness.

Property owners of historic properties or properties within historic districts shall not allow their buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. The preservation commission shall be charged with the following responsibilities regarding deterioration by neglect:
(1)
The preservation commission shall monitor the condition of historic properties and existing buildings in historic districts to determine if they are being allowed to deteriorate by neglect. Conditions such as broken windows, doors and openings which allow the elements and/or vermin to enter, the deterioration of exterior architectural features, or the deterioration of a building's structural system shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair.
(2)
If the preservation commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the preservation commission shall notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of such property shall have thirty (30) days in which to reply to such notification and set forth such owner's proposed steps to remedy the situation and then six (6) months to remedy the situation.
(3)
If documentation can be submitted showing cause as to why a particular situation cannot be remedied within six (6) months, the preservation commission may grant an extension not to exceed eighteen (18) months from original notification by the preservation commission.
(4)
If the condition is not remedied within the prescribed time limits, the owner shall be punished as provided in section 1-8 and, where such action is authorized by the governing body, the preservation commission may perform or have performed such maintenance or repair necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The cost of such maintenance and repair shall be assessed against the property and such assessment shall constitute a lien on the property until paid. An execution in favor of the city in the amount of such assessment shall be issued by the city clerk and shall be collected in accordance with the applicable provisions of law.
