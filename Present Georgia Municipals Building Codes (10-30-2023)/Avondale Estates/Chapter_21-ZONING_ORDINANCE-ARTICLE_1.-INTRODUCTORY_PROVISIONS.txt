A.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this zoning ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Whenever the provisions of any other ordinance or statute require more restrictive standards than those of this zoning ordinance, the provisions of such standards shall govern, unless provided otherwise.

Whenever the provisions of this zoning ordinance impose standards that are more restrictive than are required in or under any other statute, ordinance or resolution, these standards shall prevail, unless otherwise specified in this zoning ordinance.
C.
When a condition of approval is more restrictive than the zoning ordinance, the condition of approval shall prevail. When a requirement of the zoning ordinance is more restrictive than a previously established condition of approval, the requirements of the zoning ordinance shall prevail.
D.
Nothing herein shall repeal the conditions of use, operation, or site development accompanying zoning approval(s), variances or permits issued under previous ordinances or resolutions. All variances, exceptions, modifications, and waivers heretofore granted by the board of appeals or board of mayor and commissioners shall remain in full force and effect, and all terms, conditions and obligations heretofore imposed by the decision-making bodies shall remain in effect, unless modification or repeal of such past conditions of approval is accomplished as authorized and provided by the zoning ordinance.
E.
State or federal regulations. If the provisions of this zoning ordinance are inconsistent with those of the state or federal government, the more restrictive provision governs, to the extent allowed by law. The more restrictive provision is the one that imposes more stringent controls.
F.
Private agreements and covenants.
1.
This zoning ordinance is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any easement, covenant, deed restriction, or other agreement between private parties.

  Sec. 21-1.2.5. - Map interpretations.
A.
The city manager is the final authority in determining the current zoning status of land, buildings, and structures in the city.
B.
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the location of any zoning district boundaries as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules apply:
1.
Where possible, a rezoning file shall be used for delineating zoning boundaries. Such records shall have precedence over information otherwise contained on maps.
2.
Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as approximately following a corporate limits line, a land lot line, a lot line or the centerline of a street, a county road, a state highway, an interstate highway, or a railroad right-of-way or such lines extended, then such lines shall be construed to be the zoning district boundary lines.
3.
Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot, each portion shall be governed by the zoning district that each portion is classified.
4.
Where areas appear to be unclassified on the zoning map, classification cannot be established by the above rules, and there is no other evidence of its existing or past classification, such areas must be considered to be classified R-24 until action is taken by the board of mayor and commissioners to amend the zoning map.
C.
Where uncertainties continue to exist or further interpretation is required beyond that presented in the above subsections, the question shall be presented to the board of mayor and commissioners to enact a clarifying ordinance.
Sec. 21-1.2.6. - Split-zoned lots.
A.
The zoning map shall not be amended to classify a single parcel of land into two (2) or more base zoning districts. This provision does not apply to overlay zoning districts.
B.
If an existing parcel of land is split into two (2) or more zoning districts, each such portion of the split-zoned parcel may be used only for purposes allowed within the zoning district that each such portion is classified. No principal or accessory use of land, building or structures, and no use or building or structure authorized by permit, or conditional use permit, is allowed unless the use, building or structure is expressly authorized or permitted within the subject zoning district.
Sec. 21-1.2.7. - Relationship to comprehensive plan and future development map.
The City of Avondale Estates Comprehensive Plan, consisting of the future development map and related policies, is hereby established as the official policy of the city concerning future land uses and shall serve as a guide regarding the appropriate manner in which property shall be zoned in the city. The most recent version of the comprehensive plan, as adopted by the board of mayor and commissioners, shall identify zoning districts that are appropriate within each of the city's character areas as delineated on the future development map. No rezoning of property in the city shall be done in a manner inconsistent with the future development map and related policies of the comprehensive plan. If the board of mayor and commissioners considers a zoning map amendment request that does not concur with the policies of the comprehensive plan or future development map, approval of a comprehensive plan amendment is required before an approval can be rendered on the zoning map amendment in accordance with division 7.5 - amendments and conditional uses.
