(1)
No application will be approved for any applicant unless the applicant holds a current valid business license to operate a restaurant, pursuant to this Code.
(2)
In addition to the other requirements contained elsewhere in this section, Sunday sales permits will be granted only to those applicants who own or operate a bona fide full-service restaurant which is defined as one:
a.
Which is licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises under this article;
b.
Where meals are actually and regularly prepared and served on the premises with substantial entrees selected by the patron from a full, published menu;
c.
Which has adequate facilities and sufficient employees for cooking, preparing, keeping, and serving such meals for consumption at tables and dining areas on the premises (as determined by the county agent responsible for administering this section);
d.
Where the kitchens, dining areas and related service facilities have been approved by the county health department; and
e.
Where full food service to the public is provided on Sundays when alcoholic beverages are dispensed.
(3)
At the time of the application, the applicant shall submit to the county agent responsible for such matters, an affidavit in a form prescribed by the county that the applicant meets the requirements set out in this section for the issuance of a Sunday sales permit, together with such other receipts, financial statements, documents, and other information as may be required by said agent to confirm the accuracy of said affidavit. If determined appropriate by the responsible agent, the applicant may be required to furnish a certification from a certified public accountant confirming that the licensed location derived at least 60 percent of its total gross sales during the preceding 12 months from the sale of prepared meals or food in all of the combined retail outlets of the individual establishment where food is served. If the applicant has been in business for less than 12 months, then such affidavit or certification shall be for the time the applicant has been in business, annualized. If at the time of the application, the applicant has not received the required certification due to time constraints or other circumstances, then pending receipt of such certification, the applicant may submit other documentation satisfactory to the responsible agent that the applicant meets the requirements of this section.
(4)
The county agent responsible for administration of this section, or his delegate, is authorized to conduct an inspection of the business location and the books and records of the applicant for the purpose of verifying the facts set forth in the affidavit or certification furnished hereunder.
(5)
Upon determination by the responsible county agent that the applicant has met the requirements of this section, a Sunday sales permit shall be issued if the applicant is otherwise qualified, which shall be permanently and prominently displayed by the permit holder at the subject premises. Alternatively, the responsible county agent shall be authorized to evidence such permit by an appropriate notation on the basic alcoholic beverage license of the applicant.
(6)
Sunday sales permits issued under the provisions of this section shall be valid from the date of issue through the date of expiration of the basic license to sell alcoholic beverages by the drink for consumption on the premises held by applicant for the subject premises, unless sooner suspended or revoked. The applicant holding the Sunday sales permit issued hereunder must be identical to the holder of the basic alcoholic beverage license issued for the subject premises.
(7)
No more than 30 days prior to the expiration of the Sunday sales permit described in this section, the permit holder desiring to renew the permit shall file a new application therefor and furnish current information in like fashion as a new application.
(8)
The governing authority of the county may at any time cause an interim reverification of eligibility prior to the expiration of a Sunday sales permit and if the permit holder is found, as a result of such inquiry, to be no longer qualified under the provisions of this section to hold a Sunday sales permit, the permit shall be revoked or suspended as determined appropriate by the governing authority of the county.
(9)
No permit will be issued under this section or remain in effect unless the permit holder also holds a currently valid license for the sale of alcoholic beverages on the premises issued under this article. If the basic license of the permit holder to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises is suspended or revoked, the permit for Sunday sales issued under this section shall automatically be suspended or revoked, as the case may be. Similarly, the revocation or suspension of any authorization for Sunday sales hereunder shall be grounds for revocation or suspension of the permit holder's basic license for the sale of alcoholic beverages on the premises.
(10)
If any permit holder shall be determined to have furnished materially false information in the application for a Sunday sales permit or in the application for a basic license to sell alcoholic beverages by the drink for consumption on the premises, the governing authority of the county reserves the right to suspend or revoke the Sunday sales permit and, in addition, to take such action as it shall deem appropriate under all of the circumstances with respect to the basic license.
(11)

Sec. 4-43. - Temporary license to nonprofit organizations.
(a)
Upon the filing of an application and satisfaction of the requirements of this chapter by a bona fide nonprofit civic organization, the responsible agent may issue a temporary license authorizing the bona fide nonprofit civic organization to:
(1)
Serve alcoholic beverages for consumption only on the premises for a period not to exceed three calendar days; and/or
(2)
Auction wine in sealed containers for off-premises consumption.
No more than three permits may be issued to any bona fide nonprofit civic organization in any one calendar year pursuant to this section. Permits issued pursuant to this section shall be valid only for the location, times, and dates specified in the license. No license may be issued unless the sale of alcoholic beverages is lawful in the place for which the license is issued. For the purposes of this section, a "bona fide nonprofit civic organization" is defined as an entity which is exempt from federal income tax pursuant to the provisions of 26 USC 501(c), (d), or (e).
(b)
Bona fide nonprofit civic organizations which hold a temporary license issued pursuant to this section may auction wine in sealed containers for off-premises consumption, which has been donated to the bona fide nonprofit civic organization by a person who does not currently hold a license issued by the state department of revenue pursuant to the Georgia Alcoholic Beverage Code, wine which has been donated by a state licensed retailer, or wine which has been donated or purchased from a state licensed wine wholesaler. The bona fide nonprofit civic organization may ship or otherwise transport to the location specified in the temporary license issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section wine donated by a person who does not currently hold a license issued by the state department of revenue pursuant to the Georgia Alcoholic Beverage Code or wine donated by a state licensed retailer. State excise tax shall be paid to the state department of revenue on any donated wine. If the bona fide nonprofit civic organization cannot verify, within ten days of the conclusion of the permitted event, that state excise tax for the wine was previously paid to the state department of revenue, the bona fide nonprofit civic organization shall pay to the state department of revenue the appropriate excise tax as required by law.
(c)
The fee to be paid to the county for licenses issued under this section shall be as established in a schedule of fees and charges published from time to time by the governing authority of the county; provided that the initial fee hereunder shall be in an amount as established by the board of county commissioners from time to time.
(d)
Applications for a temporary license authorized under this section shall be made on such forms, and shall require such information, as may be prescribed by the responsible agent from time to time.
(e)
All bona fide nonprofit civic organizations applying for a temporary license under this section shall fully comply with all applicable state and federal laws regarding the scheduled event and the sale, taxation, and transportation of alcoholic beverages. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any bona fide nonprofit civic organization applying for a temporary license under this section shall also apply for and obtain any and all permits or licenses required by state or federal governments in connection with such activities (including, without limitation, the Georgia Alcoholic Beverage Code, O.C.G.A. § 3-1-1 et seq.).
(f)
Unless as otherwise specifically provided in this section, any bona fide nonprofit civic organization holding a temporary permit shall fully comply with all applicable provisions of this article required generally of licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises; provided, however, that said bona fide nonprofit civic organizations shall not be required to comply with the following sections: 4-12, 4-16, 4-37, and 4-38.
(g)
The administration of this section shall be supervised and undertaken by such persons or departments affiliated with the county as may be designated by the county administrator, and wherever in this section the term "responsible agent" is used, the same shall mean and refer to the designee of the county administrator.
