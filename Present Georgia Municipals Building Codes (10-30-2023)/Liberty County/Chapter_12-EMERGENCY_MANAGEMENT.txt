ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 12-1. - Radioactive fallout protection in county buildings.
(a)
Every officer, board, department, commission or agency of the county charged with the duty of preparing specifications, or awarding or entering into contracts for the design, erection or construction of buildings, or other structures, including additions to existing structures, for the county shall incorporate, or cause to be incorporated, in such buildings, or other structures, protection from radioactive fallout, for at least its normal anticipated occupancy, which shall meet, or exceed, the minimum space and protection criteria recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, unless exempted from such shelter requirements in accordance with this chapter.
(b)
The board of commissioners may exempt buildings or other structures from the requirements of this section where it finds that the addition of fallout protection will create, in the building or other structure, an additional net cost in excess of the funds available in the construction of such building, or that other factors make it unnecessary or impracticable to incorporate fallout protection in the design or construction of such building or structure.
(c)
It shall be the policy of the board of commissioners that fallout shelter protection shall be incorporated into all county buildings or structures to the fullest extent practicable in order to provide protection against the effects of radioactive fallout for the greatest possible number of people in the event of nuclear attack upon the United States, or an accidental nuclear explosion.

Sec. 12-22. - Emergency management and response powers.
(a)
Declaration of local emergency.
(1)
Grant of authority. In the event of an actual or threatened occurrence of a disaster or emergency, which may result in the large-scale loss of life, injury, property damage or destruction or in the major disruption of routine community affairs, business or governmental operations in the county and which is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant extraordinary assistance by federal, state and local departments and agencies to supplement the efforts of available public and private resources, the board of commissioners may declare a local emergency for the county. The form of the declaration shall be similar to that provided in subsection (b) of this section.
(2)
Request for state assistance. Consistent with a declaration of a local emergency, the chairperson may request the governor to provide assistance, provided that the disaster or emergency is beyond the capacity of the county to meet adequately and state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster.
(3)
Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the chairperson finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time the chairperson shall execute and file with the county administrator a document marking the end of the state of emergency. No state of local emergency shall continue for longer than 30 days, unless renewed by the chairperson. The board of commissioners may, by resolution, end a state of local emergency at any time.
(4)
Effect of declaration of emergency.
a.
Activation of emergency operations plan. A declaration of emergency by the governor or a declaration of local emergency by the chairperson shall automatically activate the county emergency operations plan and shall be the authority for the deployment of personnel and use of any forces to which the plan applies and for use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, materials, and facilities assembled, stockpiled or arranged to be made available pursuant to the Georgia Emergency Management Act or any other laws applicable to emergencies or disasters.
1.
The Liberty County Emergency Management Agency (LCEMA) director shall have the legal authority to exercise the powers and discharge the duties conferred upon the emergency management agency, including implementation of the emergency operations plan, coordination of the emergency response of public and private agencies and organizations, coordination of recovery efforts with state and federal officials, and inspection of emergency or disaster sites.
2.
In responding and conducting necessary and appropriate investigations the director or his designee is authorized to enter at a reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting sites involved with emergency management functions. The director is authorized to execute a right of entry and/or agreement to use property for these purposes on behalf of the county; however, any such document shall be later presented for ratification at a meeting of the board of commissioners.
3.
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his official duties.
b.
Emergency powers. Following a declaration of emergency and during the continuance of such state of emergency, the chairperson is authorized to implement local emergency measures to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation under control. In exercising this authority, the chairperson may cause to become effective any of the following sections of this chapter as appropriate: section 12-25 (registration of building and repair services) to become effective if the governor declares a state of emergency; and section 12-26 (closed or restricted areas and curfews during emergency). If any of these sections is included in a declaration of local emergency, the same shall be filed in the office of the county administrator and shall be in effect until the declaration of local emergency has terminated.
c.
Authority to waive procedures and fees. Pursuant to declaration of emergency, the board of commissioners is authorized to cause to be effective any of the subsections of section 12-24 as appropriate. The implementation of such sections shall be filed in the office of the county administrator.

6.
To utilize all available resources of the county and subordinate agencies over which the county has budgetary control as reasonably necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster;
7.
To commandeer or utilize public or private property when necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster or when there is compelling necessity for the protection of lives, health and welfare; and/or the property of citizens;
8.
To suspend any law, code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of county business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any county agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension;
9.
To provide benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes; and

County business.
(1)
Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chairperson of the board of commissioners, the affairs and business of the county may be conducted at places other than the regular or usual location, within or outside of the city, when it is not prudent, expedient or possible to conduct business at the regular location. When such meetings occur outside of the county, all actions taken by the board of commissioners shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the county. Such meetings may be called by the presiding officer or any two members of the governing body without regard to or compliance with time-consuming procedures and formalities otherwise required by law.
(2)
Local legislation should be reviewed to determine whether there are restrictions upon moving the meeting location if it is only a locally declared emergency and not a state of emergency declared by the governor.
(b)
Public works contracts. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chairperson of the board of commissioners, the county may contract for public works without letting such contract out to the lowest, responsible bidder and without advertising and posting notification of such contract for four weeks; provided, however, that the emergency must be of such nature that immediate action is required and that the action is necessary for the protection of the public's health, safety and welfare. Any public works contract entered into pursuant to this subsection shall be entered on the minutes of the city as soon as practical and the nature of the emergency described therein in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-91-22(e).
(c)
Purchasing. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chairperson of the board of commissioners, the purchasing ordinances, regulations or policies may be suspended. County officials shall continue to seek to obtain the best prices during the state of local emergency.

Code enforcement. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the chairperson of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may temporarily suspend the enforcement of the ordinances of the city, or any portion thereof, where the emergency is of such nature that immediate action outside the code is required, such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, and such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations.
(e)
Fees. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the chairperson of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners or designees may temporarily reduce or suspend any permit fees, application fees or other rate structures as necessary to encourage the rebuilding of the areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. The term "fees" includes fees or rates charged by the county for building permits, land disturbance permits, zoning applications, special land use permits, temporary land use permits and other fees relating to the reconstruction, repair and cleanup of areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. The term "fees" does not include fees collected by the county on behalf of the state or federal government or fees charged by the county pursuant to a state or federal statute or regulation.
(f)
Temporary dwellings. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or chairperson of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners or its designees may issue temporary mobile home, trailer, recreational vehicle or other temporary dwelling structures or parks in any zoning district, even though not otherwise permitted by the development code, while the primary dwelling is being repaired.

Each day any such entity does business in the county without complying with this section constitutes a separate offense.
(b)
The cost of registration fees in a declared emergency shall be determined by the chairperson of the board of commissioners. Registration is nontransferable.
