The tax commissioner will maintain a solid waste assessment billing register. Sixty days after the due date for the solid waste assessment, the tax commissioner will send a delinquency notice to each residential property owner who has not paid their correct solid waste billing. This notice will advise payment is due within 30 days or the delinquent account will be sent to the magistrate court for collection. Upon expiration of the 30-day delinquency notice time period, the tax commissioner will transmit a copy of the delinquent solid waste assessment billing register to the county board of commissioners for collection effort.

ARTICLE IV. - REGULATIONS FOR USE OF SERVICES AND FACILITIES

Sec. 34-101. - General use of facilities.
Liberty County has established solid waste management services and facilities for authorized use by the residents, municipalities, and commercial and business establishments located in the jurisdictional boundaries of the county. This article details the authorized use of these specific facilities, sets forth user fees for specific facilities and establishes penalties for unauthorized use of said facilities.
(Code 1987, § 15-201; Ord. No. 2006-001, 2-1-2006)
Sec. 34-102. - Facilities description, service fees and authorized users.
(a)
Transfer station. This facility accepts conforming nonhazardous solid waste from collection sources such as jurisdictional municipal solid waste collection services (public and privately owned), county-operated solid waste collection services (rural and commercial clients), jurisdictional commercial and business (contract and cash) customers and nonjurisdictional private residential and nonjurisdictional commercial and business clients. All solid waste processed into the transfer station is charged a published disposal fee based on the customer and the solid waste material. Disposal fees are established by the county board of commissioners (see section 34-71) and are periodically adjusted. The current fee schedule is available through the county solid waste, at the transfer station.
(b)
Convenience centers. These facilities, located throughout the unincorporated area of the county, provide interim solid waste disposal/collection points for the unincorporated residents and municipal residents of Allenhurst, Flemington, Gumbranch, Midway, Riceboro and Walthourville. (This excludes Hinesville residents who have full range solid waste collection provided by the city and thus are not assessed for associated operational/disposal costs.) These convenience centers are for use by single-family residential property owners of the unincorporated area and municipalities described above. Operational costs for these facilities are recouped through the county solid waste assessment. Use by unauthorized commercial and business or nonjurisdictional parties is prohibited. Typically, each center includes one household waste compactor with a 38- to 40-cubic-yard enclosed receiving container and two 40-cubic-yard open top containers for disposal of yard waste, scrap metal and appliances (white goods) and bulky waste (brown goods). Additionally, each center provides facilities for acceptance of recyclable items. Service fees (annual residential solid waste assessment) for authorized customers are established by the county board of commissioners (see section 34-71) and are periodically adjusted. A listing of these fees is available, through the county solid waste authority, at the commissioner's office or at the county solid waste authority transfer station.
(c)
Rural dumpster sites. The county operates several rural dumpster sites in the unincorporated area of the county. Until these sites are closed, their use is restricted to those jurisdictional residents who pay for their operation through the annual residential solid waste assessment. Use by non-jurisdictional parties and/or commercial or business enterprises is strictly prohibited.
(d)
Recycling facilities. Six additional recycling facilities are located in the municipal boundaries of Hinesville (four locations), Walthourville (one facility) and Riceboro (one facility). These facilities, in addition to those co-located at each convenience center, are operated by the county solid waste for the sole use of county residents. No business or commercial use is authorized. The disposal of any type of nonconforming waste is unauthorized at these facilities. Recyclable items are to be placed in the appropriate bins or containers. Operational costs of these facilities are recouped through the annual residential solid waste assessment.
(Code 1987, § 15-202; Ord. No. 2006-001, 2-1-2006; Ord. No. 2019-003, 7-18-2019)
Sec. 34-103. - User fees.
User fees have been established by the county board of commissioners for each of the facilities described above and are detailed in article II of this chapter. These fees are periodically adjusted by the board of commissioners. Current approved fee schedules are available at the commissioner's office or at the county solid waste transfer station.
(Code 1987, § 15-202.1; Ord. No. 2006-001, 2-1-2006; Ord. No. 2019-003, 7-18-2019)
Sec. 34-104. - Unauthorized use of convenience centers and recycling facilities.
(a)
Generally. The cost to operate the county convenience centers, rural dumpster sites and recycling facilities is funded by the annual residential solid waste assessment. Use of these facilities is strictly reserved for residents of the county who pay for their operation through the annual assessment. Unauthorized users will be cited and include those who plan to use (are physically located at a site) or have used a facility to discard solid waste or recyclables and persons who are scavenging or have scavenged items from the solid waste collection containers or recycling facilities. Unauthorized users will be cited and will be subject to court fees, fines and disposal costs as determined by the county magistrate court, the table of offenses, fines and disposal charges (see section 34-105) and the county solid waste.
(b)
Proof of authorization. The prima facie evidence of unauthorized use is the user's vehicle license plate. Out-of-county plates suggest the user is unauthorized. However, the out-of-county user is authorized to use the facility if they have received and paid the current annual residential solid waste assessment. A current paid receipt for the solid waste assessment supported by a second form of personal identification validates the authorized facility use by such residents. Officers of the county charged with validating solid waste facility users are to explain the reasons for verifying the user's residency; advise the out-of-county user to carry a copy of the paid solid waste assessment receipt; take the users name, home address and telephone number and license plate number and allow use of the facility. The name, address, license plate number and phone number will be transmitted to the litter control deputy for validation of authorized use. Fraudulent cases will be cited for unauthorized use through magistrate court.
(c)
Identification. Unauthorized users will be identified as follows:
(1)
Observation by the county litter control deputy or other solid waste employee. Observed use includes the physical act of waste disposal or being at a site with the intent to use the facility for waste disposal; or being on site to scavenge; being found in the act of scavenging; or found with scavenged material in their possession.
(2)
Reporting of apparent unauthorized use by the general public under the silent witness program or by calling the offices of the county commission or the solid waste authority. In such cases, prima facie evidence is being on site using a vehicle with an out-of-county license plate or operation of a vehicle with affixed business logo operated by the potential offender who has or plans to dispose of waste typical of the business, and, if available, a description of the individual and the vehicle, the time and facility being used, and the type of waste being disposed of or scavenged. Additional evidence of unauthorized use is identifiable discards of solid waste (letters, bank receipts, credit card slips, magazines with address labels, shipping containers with ship-to addresses, business papers, etc.). Reports of this type will be accepted telephonically, in writing or verbally.
(3)
Apprehension by an officer of the law. In this case, the apprehending officer will issue a citation to the offending party. No warnings will be given.
(4)
After-the-fact clean-up of materials disposed of at any of the county facilities or materials discarded elsewhere in the county (private or publicly owned lands). In such cases, prima facie evidence will be any item recovered from the discards which bears a name, address or other form of personal identification which would indicate the last ownership of the improperly discarded items.
(d)
Citation. Citations for unauthorized use of a county solid waste collection/disposal/recycling facility, unless issued by an officer of the law other than the county litter control deputy, will be written by the county litter control deputy and prosecuted through the county magistrate court. No warning will be issued since all facilities have been signed advising that unauthorized use is prohibited.
(e)
Payment of fines and disposal charges. The county magistrate court will prosecute each case. The county solid waste authority will provide the court with calculated weight tickets detailing the associated pull fees, disposal charges and clean-up costs as appropriate for each citation. These costs are to be added to the fines presented in the tables of offenses, fines and disposal charges shown below. Upon payment to the court, the applicable fines and disposal charges will to turned over to the county solid waste through the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court.
