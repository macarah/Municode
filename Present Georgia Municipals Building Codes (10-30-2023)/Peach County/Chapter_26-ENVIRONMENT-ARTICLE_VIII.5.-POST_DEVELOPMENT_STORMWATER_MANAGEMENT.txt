ARTICLE VIII.5. - POST DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

Sec. 26-351. - Intent and purpose.
(a)
Intent. Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition. Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased non-point source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and quantity can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. Peach County, Georgia (the "county") is required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations, and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and non-point source pollution. The intent of this article is to ensure impacts of new development and re-development can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quality and quantity from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas, and meet state and federal laws, regulations, and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and non-point source pollution.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this post development stormwater management ordinance ("ordinance") is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet the purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(2)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, non-point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(3)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(4)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(5)
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable.
(6)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are properly maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and
(7)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval, disapproval and permitting of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.
(c)
This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
(d)
The county administrator or designee shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article.

All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the county before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the county may impose additional requirement(s) deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased non-point source pollution loads created on the site in question.
Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control.
(2)
Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under section 26-359. The applicant may, if approved by the county, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that quality for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.
(3)
Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-ways. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff shall meet the following requirements:
a.
Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and the County's Local Stormwater Management Manual.
b.
All culvert, pipe systems and open channel flow systems and facilities shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and the county's local stormwater management manual.
(4)
Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.

Sec. 26-363. - Ongoing inspection and maintenance of stormwater facilities and practices.
(a)
Maintenance inspection of stormwater facilities and practices: Stormwater management facilities and systems include in a stormwater management plan which is subject to an inspection and maintenance agreement requiring ongoing inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of the agreement, the approved stormwater management plan and this article. A stormwater management facility or practice shall be inspected on a periodic basis by the responsible person in accordance with the approved inspection and maintenance agreement and a report of the inspections be sent to the county stormwater manager annually. In the event that the inspection reports are not submitted to the county stormwater manager or the stormwater management system or facility has not been maintained and/or becomes a danger to public safety or public health or deemed a public nuisance, the county shall notify the owner by registered or certified mail. The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the agreement and the approved stormwater management plan and shall specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. If the owner fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintained agreement, the county, may correct the violations and hold the owner responsible for the cost of such corrective action. The county may conduct routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in stormwater management facilities; and evaluating the condition of stormwater management facilities and practices.
