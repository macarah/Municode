DIVISION 4. - MEDIA PRODUCTION

Sec. 34-120. - Purpose.
It is the public policy of the State of Georgia to market the state as a location for media productions, recognizing the economic impact this industry provides for local jurisdictions, such as the City of Berkeley Lake. The city is further fortunate to have a number of unique locations to attract media productions to the city.
Despite the many positive benefits a media production may offer, certain inconveniences may result if the production company and city cannot work in concert to assure minimum standards are met and to assure a thoroughly-planned production schedule is followed. The motion picture, television, internet and other media industries can be environmentally clean industries, desirable for the city so long as there is adequate regulation to protect the health, safety and well-being of the local community, atmosphere and environment.
