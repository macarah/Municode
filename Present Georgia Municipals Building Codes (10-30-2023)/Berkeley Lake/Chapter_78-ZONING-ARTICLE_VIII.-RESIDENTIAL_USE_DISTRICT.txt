ARTICLE VIII. - RESIDENTIAL USE DISTRICT

Sec. 78-194. - General purposes of residential districts.
The residential districts established in this article are designed to promote and protect public health, safety and general welfare. These general goals include, among others, the following purposes:
(1)
To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for residential development to meet the housing needs of the city's present and expected future population, with due allowance for the need for a choice of sites.
(2)
To protect residential areas against fire, explosions, toxic and noxious matter, radiation, and other hazards, and against offensive noise, vibration, smoke and other particulate matter, odorous matter, heat, humidity, glare and other objectionable influences.
(3)
To protect residential areas against heavy traffic and against through traffic of all kinds.
(4)
To protect residential areas against congestion by regulating the density of population and the bulk of buildings in relation to the land around them and to one another, and by providing for offstreet parking spaces, to require the provision of open space in residential areas wherever practicable, and to encourage the provision of additional open space by permitting moderately higher bulk and density with better standards of open space, in order to open up residential areas to light and air and provide open areas for rest and recreation.
(5)
To provide for access of light and air to windows and for privacy by controls over the spacing and height of buildings and other structures.
(6)
To provide appropriate space for those educational, religious, recreational, health and similar facilities which serve the needs of the nearby residents, which generally perform their own activities more effectively in a residential environment, and which do not create objectionable influences.
