ARTICLE X. - COMMERCIAL USE DISTRICT

Sec. 78-267. - General purposes of commercial districts.
The commercial districts established in this article are designed to promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare. These general goals include, among others, the following specific purposes:
(1)
To provide sufficient space, in appropriate locations in proximity to residential areas, for local retail development catering to the regular shopping needs of the occupants of nearby residences, with due allowance for the need for a choice of sites.
(2)
To provide appropriate space, and in particular sufficient depth from a street, to satisfy the needs of modern local retail development, including the need for offstreet parking spaces in areas to which a large proportion of shoppers come by automobile, and to encourage the natural tendency of local retail development to concentrate in continuous retail frontage, to the mutual advantage of both consumers and merchants.
(3)
To protect both local retail development and nearby residences against fire, explosion, toxic and noxious matter, radiation and other hazards, and against offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust and other particulate matter, odorous matter, heat, humidity and glare and other objectionable influences.
(4)
To protect both local retail development and nearby residences against congestion, particularly in areas where the established pattern is predominantly residential but includes local retail uses on the lower floors, by regulating the intensity of local retail development, by restricting those types of establishments which generate heavy traffic, and by providing for offstreet parking and loading facilities.
(5)
To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for all types of commercial and miscellaneous service activities, with due allowance for the need for a choice of site.
(6)
To provide freedom of architectural design, in order to encourage the development of more attractive and economic building forms, within proper standards.
(7)
To promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building development in accord with a well-considered plan, to promote stability of commercial development, to strengthen the economic base of the city, to protect the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, to conserve the value of the land and buildings and to protect the city's tax revenue.
