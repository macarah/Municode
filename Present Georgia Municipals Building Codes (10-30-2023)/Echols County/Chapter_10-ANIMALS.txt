Sec. 10-92. - Disposition of impounded animals.
(a)
It shall be the duty of the animal control unit to immediately notify the owner of each domesticated animal impounded if the owner of the domesticated animal is known or can be reasonably ascertained. The owner of any domesticated animal impounded may reclaim such domesticated animal by payment of fees as required by the impound facility.
(b)
If any animal is seized or impounded by the animal control unit and shows evidence of contagious, infectious or fatal diseases, or is seriously ill or severely injured, such animal will be evaluated and the advice of a licensed veterinarian sought to determine whether to treat or euthanize the animal. In the absence of an available veterinarian, the animal control officer will determine a just reason for euthanasia. These steps will be taken to control disease spread and eliminate further pain and suffering of the animal. All attempts made to treat the animal and all veterinary expenses incurred will be paid by the owner of such animal.
(c)
Any animal which is suffering excessively, or exhibits feral or wild tendencies or may present a real danger to persons or other animals, may be, without regard to the confinement period, destroyed by the most humane method available.
