DIVISION 15. - ABANDONMENT, REDUCTION IN FORCE, AND PROMOTIONS

Sec. 2-461. - Job abandonment.
Employees who are absent from work for three or more consecutive days without having received leave approval or without having called in to report the absence will be considered as having voluntarily abandoned their jobs. The separation will not be in good standing and may affect the opportunities for re-employment.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, art. XV)
Sec. 2-462. - Reduction in force.
A reduction in force may be necessary when a position or group of positions must be closed because of lack of work or lack of funds. Employees who are separated in reduction-in-force may, at the discretion of the county manager, receive preference in rehiring should a position for which they are qualified opens within that year.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, art. XVI)
Sec. 2-463. - Promotional goals.
Promotional vacancies may be filled with applicants external to the county work force at the discretion of the appointing authority. Normally, however, an attempt will be made to fill the vacancy from within if there is a qualified applicant already working with the county and such action would not be in conflict with the county's anti-discrimination or unfair employment practices.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, § 17.01)
Sec. 2-464. - Effect of a promotion.
If a formal job classification plan is in effect, a promoted employee will be placed in the step in the new job class that the appointing authority deems appropriate under the circumstances. If no formal plan is in effect, the employee will be paid a salary deemed appropriate by the appointing authority.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, § 17.02)
Sec. 2-465. - Relationship of promotions to performance pay increases.
If the county, at the time of promotion, has a system for performance pay in effect, the promotion will not interfere with the employee's consideration for a performance pay increase at the next scheduled performance evaluation date.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, § 17.03)
Sec. 2-466. - Effective date.
The effective date of any promotion, for compensation purposes, will be the first day of the next pay period following the date the appointing authority approves the promotion.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, § 17.04)
Secs. 2-467—2-485. - Reserved.
