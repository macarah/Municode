DIVISION 7. - DISCIPLINE

Sec. 2-215. - Progressive discipline.
(a)
Progressive discipline is a process in which disciplinary action is taken in degrees of increasing severity. County officials advocate progressive discipline when applicable. The action taken will depend on the degree and the circumstances of the violation. An employee who fails to satisfactorily perform assigned duties or who violated established procedures will be disciplined. The officials recognize six degrees of progressive disciplinary actions that fall into two general categories:
(1)
Reprimands:
a.
Oral.
b.
Written.
(2)
Adverse actions:
a.
Suspension without pay.
b.
Disciplinary demotion.
c.
Dismissal.
(b)
As an "at-will" employer, the county is not required to give causes of disciplinary action either in these policies or at the time of the adverse personnel action, nor is the county required to dismiss only for any so-called "just cause." On the other hand, the county officials feel that effective communications can enhance the efficiency and morale of the organization. Therefore, the following list of possible reasons for disciplinary action is intended to communicate to the employee several general reasons that are universally accepted as causes for discipline in public sector employers. These reasons are neither mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive. The appointing authority may discipline for any combination of reasons, for reasons not listed below, or for uncommunicated reasons at any time as long as the employee's constitutionally protected liberty interests are not violated.

Sec. 2-217. - Drug free policy.
modified
It is the policy of the county board to provide a safe, healthy, and secure work environment for all employees. It is also the policy of the county board to ensure that all employees perform their job duties in a safe, productive, and efficient manner. Finally, it is the policy of the county board to ensure that its equipment and facilities are maintained and utilized appropriately so as not to pose a risk of harm. As the use of drugs and the misuse of alcohol are inconsistent with these policies, to protect the health safety and welfare of employees, citizens, visitors and persons who interact with county employees during the course and scope of their employment, county has adopted this drug free policy which shall be strictly enforced.
(1)
Prohibited conduct. The following violations of the drug free policy constitute gross misconduct and shall result in severe disciplinary action up to and including discharge:
a.
Unauthorized use, possession, sale or solicitation for the purpose of purchase/sale of drugs or alcohol on county property or while the employee is on duty.
b.
Hindering, obstructing or refusing to cooperate or participate in any investigation involving suspected violations of this policy. This includes, but is not limited to, providing false, misleading or incomplete information in response to any inquiry from a supervisor related to a suspected violation of this policy. It also includes refusing to undergo drug or alcohol testing.
c.
Hindering, delaying or obstructing drug or alcohol testing, including but not limited to, tampering with a sample or interfering in any way with the chain of custody.
d.
Reporting to work or engaging in any work activity whatsoever on behalf of the county in a condition which could pose a threat of harm to the employee or any other person, or reporting to or engaging in any work on behalf of the county in a condition which could impair the ability to satisfactorily perform any essential function of the job, due to the use of drugs or misuse of alcohol. The presence of any detectable amount of drugs, or the presence of alcohol in the concentration of 0.04 breath alcohol content (BAC) or greater, creates a presumption that the employee is in violation of the county drug/alcohol free policy. No CDL employee shall perform their safety sensitive job functions within four hours after using alcohol.
e.
Abusing or misusing prescription drugs or over the counter medication when such conduct could reasonably interfere with the safe or satisfactory performance of any essential job functions. This includes, but is not limited to, the use, possession, sale or solicitation for the purpose of purchase or sale any prescription medication for which the employee lacks a valid prescription.
(2)
Prohibited substances.
a.
"Drugs" refers to marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, opiates (including heroin and codeine), phencyclidine, and all other "controlled substances" as defined in title 16 of the Official Code of Georgia.
b.
"Alcohol" includes any beverage or substance containing alcohol manufactured for the primary purpose of personal consumption.
c.
"Prescription drugs" means any substance, which is attainable only by lawful prescription from a physician.
d.
"Over the counter medication" includes any substance which does not require a prescription but which has the capacity to affect a person physically, mentally or emotionally, or which could otherwise affect a person's ability to safely perform any essential job function.
(3)
When testing is required.
a.
Pre-employment. Applicants for positions requiring a commercial driver's license (CDL) or safety sensitive positions will be tested after a conditional offer of employment has been extended. An applicant who refuses drug testing or who tests positive shall not be extended a final offer of employment.
b.
Random testing. CDL positions and safety sensitive positions shall be subject to random testing as follows:
1.
Tests will be ordered on a random, unannounced basis from the pool of identified CDL and safety sensitive employees.
2.
A computer based random number generator will be used to select employees, thereby allowing each employee an equal chance of being tested each month.
3.
At least 50 percent of the employees in the CDL/DOT random testing pool will be selected for substance abuse testing, and at least 25 percent of employees for breath alcohol testing. Actual percentages will be as required by the federal highway administration (FHWA).
4.
At least two percent to ten percent of other county approved safety sensitive employees per department will be selected and tested for drugs and alcohol each year.
5.
An employee's name will remain in the pool after being selected so that every employee will have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. Therefore, it is possible that any CDL or safety sensitive employee who is randomly selected for testing may be randomly selected again in the same year.
c.
After-care testing. Persons in safety sensitive positions returning to work from an approved treatment program for drug or alcohol abuse may be subject to unannounced testing at the discretion of the department director for a period of six months following the employee's return to work.
d.
Return to duty testing. CDL and safety sensitive employees who are absent from work or any leave for more than 30 days shall be tested for drugs immediately upon returning to work and before performing any job duties.
e.
Position testing. Employees who are transferred, promoted, or demoted into a CDL or safety sensitive position from a non-CDL/non-safety sensitive position will be tested for drugs before performing any job duties in the new position.
f.
Reasonable suspicion. All employees will be subject to testing when there is a reasonable suspicion that the employee has used drugs or misused alcohol in violation of this policy. Grounds for reasonable suspicion testing include, but are not limited to:
1.
Personal observation of the employee's job performance, appearance, behavior, speech, or odor creating a reasonable suspicion that the employee has used drugs or alcohol in violation of this policy.
2.
Personal observation of the employee's job performance, appearance, behavior, speech, or odor which causes reasonable suspicion that the employee:
(i)
Is impaired by drugs or alcohol;
(ii)
Has used drugs or alcohol while on duty; or
(iii)
Poses a threat to the safety of such employee or others due to the use of drugs or misuse of alcohol in violation of this policy.
3.
Specific and objective facts indicating that an employee's drug or alcohol use may have caused or been a contributing factor to an on-duty motor vehicle accident. Alcohol testing should be completed within 32 hours of the accident. The following facts, if present may independently or collectively, depending upon the circumstances, give rise to reasonable suspicion:
(i)
The appearance, behavior, speech, or odor of an employee immediately prior to or following the accident;
(ii)
The employee left or attempted to leave the accident scene without legal authority or permission to do so;
(iii)
The employee acted contrary to a safety rule, established safety practice or otherwise engaged in demonstrably unsafe behavior for which there is no reasonable explanation;
(iv)
The employee was arrested or received a traffic citation;
(v)
The employee or any person received medical attention as a result of the accident;
(vi)
The employee has been involved, as a contributing factor in a pattern of repetitive on-duty motor vehicle accidents, whether or not they involved actual or potential injury.
4.
Drugs, drug paraphernalia, alcohol, or containers indicating the presence of drugs or alcohol are observed or discovered in a location in which the employee had primary control or access, including but not limited to, desks, lockers, equipment, machines, or vehicles. The employee must have accessed the location within eight hours prior to the discovery of such items.
5.
Specific and objective facts showing the employee diluted, tainted, tampered, or interfered with any breath, blood, or urine sample, or any tests required under this policy, or that the employee attempted to do the same.
g.
Post accident testing.
1.
When a CDL or safety sensitive employee may have caused or contributed to an on-duty motor vehicle accident involving the loss of human life; or
2.
When a CDL employee has been involved in an on-duty motor vehicle accident where the employee received a citation, medical attention is required and administered away from the scene, or if a vehicle is towed from the accident site, alcohol testing should be completed within two hours and drug testing within 32 hours of the accident. This testing is to be performed in addition to any drug or alcohol testing ordered by law enforcement authorities.
h.
Consent. When any employee has consented to drug or alcohol testing, the consent must be signed by the employee and a supervisor from the employee's department, or an authorized person from the county administrator. The following may require a reasonable suspicion drug or alcohol testing:
1.
Any supervisor who has received training in the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use and impairment may require an employee to undergo reasonable suspicion testing for drugs or alcohol based upon:
(i)
The personal observation of the employee by the trained individual;
(ii)
Personal observation of the employee by another employee who has fully disclosed the observations to the trained individual; or
(iii)
Observation of the employee by a nurse or physician engaged in the treatment or evaluation of a work related injury who has disclosed such observation to the trained individual.
2.
Any untrained supervisor may require reasonable suspicion testing for drugs or alcohol based on personal observation of the employee under the following circumstances:
(i)
The employee has been independently observed by a trained supervisor, or
(ii)
A trained supervisor has reviewed the underlying facts and agrees that reasonable suspicion exists to require a test.
3.
Any trained supervisor or trained member of risk management may require reasonable suspicion drug or alcohol testing following a work-related accident based upon personal observation of the employee or upon review of the specific and objective facts underlying the accident.
4.
In addition to any supervisor trained in detecting drug and alcohol impairment, any employee trained in risk management may require reasonable suspicion of drugs or alcohol testing under subsections (3)f.3, (3)f.4 and (3)g of this section.
(4)
Persons subject to testing.
a.
CDL employees. Employees who are required to possess a CDL license as a job requirement are subject to all testing provision of this policy, including but not limited to, pre-employment and random testing.
b.
Safety sensitive employees. Safety sensitive employees occupy positions where a lapse in judgment or impaired physical/mental ability in performing any essential job function could reasonably result in a significant threat of harm to the employee, fellow employees, citizens, inmates, or others. Safety sensitive positions include but are not limited to those which, as part of the essential job functions, require the performance of law enforcement duties as a POST-certified law enforcement officer; possession of a firearm; providing emergency medical, rescue, or fire suppression service; interacting with incarcerated persons, performing duties essential to drug interdiction; or performing duties which directly affect public health or safety. A complete list of safety sensitive positions is maintained in the county manager's office and all job descriptions for safety sensitive positions are designated as such.
c.
Job applicants. Applicants for safety sensitive and CDL positions are subject to pre-employment testing after a conditional offer of employment has been extended.
d.
Non-CDL/non-safety sensitive employees. All non-CDL and non-safety sensitive employees are subject to drug and alcohol testing unless specifically excluded.
e.
Employees in office of constitutional officers and independent elected officials. Employees in the offices of constitutional officers and independent elected officials are subject to this policy to the extent that it has been adopted by the respective constitutional officer or independent elected official. If so adopted, the term "department director" is intended to include "constitutional officer" and "elected official."
(5)
Procedure.
a.
Whenever there is a reasonable suspicion to require drug or alcohol testing under this policy, the department director or designee shall be notified of the circumstances necessitating the testing as soon as possible.
b.
All circumstances causing reasonable suspicion to require drug or alcohol testing shall be fully documented by the supervisor and all appropriate witnesses as soon as possible.
c.
All county issued equipment, property, and facilities, including but not limited to, desks, lockers, and vehicles (collectively "materials") are subject to inspection at any time and for any reason. No employee shall have any privacy interest whatsoever in any county issued materials. No personal property may be searched unless the owner of the property has consented or a search is otherwise legally permissible.
d.
Alcohol screening will be conducted using a federally approved evidential breath-testing device. An initial screening test of two breath samples will be conducted first, and if an initial test detects any level of alcohol, a second confirmation test of two additional breath samples will be completed.
e.
Drug testing will check for marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, opiates (including heroin and codeine), and phencyclidine (PCP). Testing will involve initial screening tests and confirmation of positive tests by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. Test results will be certified, to the fullest extent possible, under the circumstances by a laboratory approved by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).
f.
All positive test results for drugs will be interpreted by a physician approved by the county as a medical review officer (MRO) before the results are reported to the county. Prior to notifying the county, the MRO will make reasonable efforts to contact the employee for the purpose of allowing the employee to offer an alternative medical explanation for the positive test result. If the MRO is able to contact the employee and determines there is a legitimate medical explanation for the positive test, the result will be communicated as negative to the county. The MRO's inability to contact the employee before providing test results to the county will not void the test result or make the test result unusable in any subsequent disciplinary action. Because the employee is present for interpretation of an alcohol test, the procedure concerning prior notification by the MRO is not applicable.
g.
Upon notification by the MRO of a verified positive result for the drugs, the employee may request that the remaining portion of the employee's split specimen undergo a second confirmation test at the employee's expense at a DHHS laboratory of the employee's choice. If the test conducted by the laboratory selected by the employee is negative for the presence of drugs, a third test may be made at the county's sole expense at a separate DHHS facility of its own choosing. The results of the third facility will be determinative. If the results from the third facility are negative, all prior positive tests will be disregarded and shall not be the basis for any disciplinary or adverse action.
h.
The county will make reasonable efforts to notify the employee of a positive drug test within five days from the date it receives the test results. Because the results of a breath alcohol test are immediately available, this provision will not apply to alcohol tests conducted in such a manner.
i.
Any employee ordered to be tested, based upon reasonable suspicion, shall be immediately removed from duty, escorted to the testing facility and taken home (unless other suitable arrangements have been made to transport the employee). Under no circumstances will the employee be allowed to drive home. The employee shall be placed on paid administrative leave pending the results of the test.
j.
Any employee who tests positive for drugs or alcohol shall immediately be relieved from duty, placed on paid administrative leave, and sent home pending disciplinary action, if appropriate.
k.
Any refusal to consent to drug or alcohol testing or property search will be considered insubordination and gross misconduct, and subject the employee to severe disciplinary action up to and including termination.
l.
In the event that it is not reasonable under the circumstances to conduct an alcohol test based on a breath test, the county reserves the right to test for the presence of alcohol by a blood test analysis. If this procedure is used, the county will attempt to notify the employee of the results within five days after the results are received. An MRO will not be used when a blood test for alcohol is conducted.
(6)
Employee assistance program. Any employee who voluntarily self-identifies as user of drugs or abuser of alcohol, prior to being asked or required to take drug/alcohol testing, will not be subject to disciplinary action if the employee seeks immediate assistance and treatment through the county's employee assistance program or a similarly available treatment program. Failure to comply with all requirements of a treatment program, or continued use of drugs or alcohol during or after completion of such a program, will result in an appropriate disciplinary action if such use caused the employee to violate this policy. Nothing in this policy is intended to discriminate against any person on the basis of addiction to drugs or alcohol, or on the basis of an individual's medical history of addiction to drugs or alcohol pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, the county reserves the right to take into account, for purposes of employment or disciplinary action, any history of criminal activity related to such use to the extent such may lead to disqualification from employment.
(7)
Arrests for drug or alcohol related offenses. Any CDL or safety sensitive employee who is arrested for a drug or alcohol related offense must notify their department director of the arrest immediately. The county will make determination at that time whether the arrest causes a temporary or permanent disqualification from holding that position, or constitutes grounds for disciplinary action. All convictions for alcohol or drug related offenses must be reported immediately by a CDL or safety sensitive employee to their department director. The county reserves the right to take appropriate action based upon such conviction. All non-safety sensitive employees and non-CDL holders who are required to operate a county vehicle as a regular part of their jobs must report any drug or alcohol arrest, temporary or permanent suspension of driving privileges, and drug/alcohol related conviction to their department director immediately. The county reserves the right to take appropriate action, including relieving the employee from duty, transferring the employee to a non-driving position, or instituting disciplinary action up to and including termination.
(8)
Confidentiality. All reports of test results for drug and alcohol, searches, or any employee referral, or participation in an EAP program or treatment program for addictive disorders, will be maintained in strict confidence. Any person authorized to have access to such confidential information, who, without authorization, discloses it to another person shall have engaged is gross misconduct and be subject to severe disciplinary action up to and including termination. The confidentiality of such information shall not apply to any use by or communication to the county, or where the information is relevant to the county's defense in an administrative or civil action. Such information may also be disclosed to the extent required by any federal, state or local law, statute, ordinance or regulation.

Sec. 2-218. - Disciplinary actions.
modified
The five disciplinary actions are defined as follows:
(1)
Reprimands. A reprimand is a formal means of communicating to the employee a warning that a problem exists and that it must be corrected. There are two degrees of formality, the oral reprimand and the written reprimand.
a.
Oral reprimand. In an oral reprimand, the supervisor should verbally and privately explain to the employee that the employee is being reprimanded and describe the problem and what must be done to correct the problem.
b.
Written reprimand. In the written reprimand, the employee should receive a written statement describing the problem and what must be done to correct the problem. The reprimand should also contain a statement describing the probable consequences of not correcting the problem. If the employee is at work, the written statement should be given to the employee during a private interview.
(2)
Adverse actions. An adverse action is an action taken for any reason by the appointing authority or designees that results in a disciplinary suspension without pay, disciplinary demotion, or disciplinary dismissal.
a.
Suspension without pay. An employee may be suspended without pay by the appointing authority or its designee. The suspension without pay should not exceed 30 days.
b.
Disciplinary demotion. An employee may be demoted from one position to a lower position for disciplinary reasons if a lower position is open and if the employee is qualified to perform the work at the lower position. A disciplinary demotion should include a decrease in salary.
c.
Dismissal. An employee may be dismissed for disciplinary reasons when all other alternatives have failed to solve the problem or, in the judgment of the county manager, dismissal is the only appropriate action.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, ยง 7.04)
Sec. 2-219. - Notice of proposed adverse action.
The department head or supervisor should give the employee a notification of the proposed adverse action prior to the effective date of the action. (The specific timetable depends on the type of adverse action and is outlined in section 2-223(1) and (2). The notice should contain:
(1)
The effective date of the action and that it is only a proposed action and will become final only if the employee does not respond or if it is later upheld in an appeal process;
(2)
The charges or reasons for the action (see sections 2-215 and 2-216);
(3)
A statement informing the employee that said employee may respond to the county manager or other named official. In a case of an employee of a department subject to the jurisdiction of an elected constitutional officer, the employee may respond to the elected constitutional officer; and
(4)
A warning that a failure to respond to the county manager, or the appropriate elected constitutional officer will result in the loss of an opportunity to appeal the adverse action any further and that the proposed action will be implemented as proposed.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, ยง 7.05)
Sec. 2-220. - Employee response to proposal of adverse action.
The employee must respond in writing to the county manager or the appropriate elected constitutional officer within the time period outlined in section 2-223(1) and (2), depending on the nature of the proposed action.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, ยง 7.06)
Sec. 2-221. - Named official response to employee.
The county manager or the appropriate elected constitutional officer, after considering the employee's response, should arrange for a hearing and notify the employee within the time frames outlined in section 2-223(1) and (2), hold the hearing, and notify the employee of the results.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, ยง 7.07)
Sec. 2-222. - Postponement of deadlines.
If the employee responds to the county manager or the appropriate elected constitutional officer, the county manager or the appropriate elected constitutional officer may postpone the deadline for the employee's response by a specific number of days to conduct further investigation. If the deadline for response is postponed, the effective date of the proposed action should be postponed by as many days.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, ยง 7.08)
Sec. 2-223. - Procedures for administering adverse actions.
modified
These procedures are divided into two categories: disciplinary action involving dismissal and disciplinary action involving adverse actions other than dismissal.
(1)
Cases where the discipline involves disciplinary suspension without pay or disciplinary demotion.
a.
In order to discipline an employee by suspending the employee without pay, or demoting the employee, the employee should be notified (15 days prior to the proposed effective date) by the department head or supervisor of the type of disciplinary action that is being proposed, the reasons therefor, and the effective date(s) of the action. The notice should include a statement that indicates to the employee that the employee may request a hearing before the county manager or the elected constitutional officer supervising the department in which the employee is employed provided that the employee files a written request within five days of receiving the notice of adverse action.
b.
The county manager or the appropriate elected constitutional officer should then schedule a hearing, within ten days of receiving the request and so notify the employee. No action should be implemented before the employee receives a hearing before the county manager or the appropriate elected constitutional officer, if a hearing is requested.
c.
The employee may bring witnesses and have legal counsel. If witnesses are brought in, the county manager and/or designee or the elected constitutional officer may cross examine or otherwise question the witnesses. Under no circumstances, however, should this hearing be considered or treated as an adversarial hearing. This hearing is designed solely to obtain facts and does not alter the at-will status of the employee or create any property interest in the position of employment with the county. Technical rules of evidence shall not apply.
d.
The county manager or the elected constitutional officer may elect to dismiss, uphold, or modify the proposed adverse action and should notify the employee in writing, within five working days of hearing, of the decision. Disciplinary action shall be implemented following the county manager's decision.
e.
The notification should also include a statement to the employee not employed by an elected constitutional officer that indicates the employee may appeal the county manager's decision, provided the employee responds in writing to the county manager within five days of receipt of the county manager's notification. If the employee does not respond within five days, the employee waives the possibility of further appeal. If an appeal is requested, the county manager should arrange for a hearing before the county commissioners. The decision of an elected constitutional officer shall not be subject to appeal.
f.
The county commissioners shall set a time and place for a hearing to be held not less than ten nor more than 20 working days after receipt of the request and shall notify the employee thereof. The hearing shall be conducted informally, and technical rules of evidence shall not apply. All testimony shall be under oath. A vote of the majority of the members of the county commissioners shall be final. The affected employee shall be notified in writing within ten working days by the county manager of the final determination with respect to the disciplinary action.
g.
In the event the county commissioners find that the disciplinary action was not well founded, the affected employee shall be paid in full for such portion of time as the employee was unjustly suspended or removed. In the event that the disciplinary action taken was removal, the employee affected shall be restored to the employee's former position and pay status.
h.
Any hearings or appeals provided to employees should not be interpreted as exercises of judicial power. Such hearings are merely voluntary compliances with forms of judicial procedure and do not in any way change the at-will status of all county employment.
(2)
Cases where the disciplinary action involves dismissal.
a.
In this type of adverse action, the employee should be notified by the department head/supervisor or elected constitutional officer that the employee is being suspended with pay pending termination. The notification should contain the reasons for the action and the effective date (which should be ten days from date of notification or proposed action) and should contain a statement that the employee may request a hearing before the county manager or elected constitutional officer. The employee must file a written request for a hearing within three days of receiving the notice of proposed dismissal.
b.
The county manager or elected constitutional officer should then schedule a hearing within five days of receiving the request and so notify the employee. The employee should not be terminated before the employee receives a hearing before the county manager or elected constitutional officer, if a hearing is requested. The employee may bring witnesses and may have legal counsel. If witnesses are brought in, the county manager, or designee, or elected constitutional officer may cross examine and otherwise question the witness. Under no circumstances, however, should this hearing be considered or treated as an adversarial hearing. This hearing is designed solely to obtain facts and does not alter the at-will status of the employee or create any property interest in the position of employment with the county.
c.
The county manager or elected constitutional officer may elect to dismiss, uphold or modify the proposed dismissal and should notify the employee in writing within two days of the decision. Dismissal of the employee shall be implemented following the county manager's or elected county officer's decision.
d.
The notification should also include a statement to the employee which indicates that the employee may appeal the county manager's decision, provided said employee responds in writing to the county commissioners within five days of receipt of the county manager's notification. If the employee does not respond in five days, the employee waives the possibility of further appeal. If an appeal is requested, the appointing authority should arrange for a hearing and notify the employee of the date. The decision of an elected county official is not subject to appeal.
e.
The county commissioners shall set a time and place for a hearing to be held not less than ten nor more than 20 working days after receipt of the request and shall notify the employee thereof. The hearing shall be conducted informally, and technical rules of evidence shall not apply. All testimony shall be under oath. A majority vote of the members of the county commissioners shall be final. The affected employee shall be notified in writing within ten working days by the county manager of the final determination with respect to the disciplinary action.
f.
In the event the county commissioners find that the disciplinary action was not well founded, the affected employee shall be paid in full for such portion of time as said employee was unjustly removed and shall be restored to the employee's former position and pay status.
g.
Any hearings or appeals provided to employees should not be interpreted as an exercise of judicial power. Such hearings are merely voluntary compliance with forms of judicial procedure and do not in any way change the at-will status of all county employment.
