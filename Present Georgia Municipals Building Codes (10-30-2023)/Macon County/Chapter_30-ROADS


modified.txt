DIVISION 3. - NUMBERING

Sec. 30-64. - Display of road address numbers.
Each location noted on the master address list for E911 shall be required to purchase an address sign as described herein. The county shall bill the residents or owner of the business for each sign installed. The amount charged for the address sign shall be as established by the board of county commissioners from time to time. The sign shall be installed on a metal post and metal sign with the display of official reflective address numbers so that they are clearly visible from the street or road on which the driveway to the property is. No other signs will be allowed to be displayed. The following criteria shall be used to properly display the numbers:
(1)
Address numbers must meet the minimum size requirements indicated as follows:
a.
Posts upon which they are mounted must bear reflective letters three inches in height.
b.
Residences and businesses in unincorporated areas of the county must place posts bearing a blue sign with white reflective address numbers three inches in height, and in immediate proximity to the driveway or private road that leads to such residence or business.
(2)
Numbers for a multiple dwelling complex or nonresidential building shall be three inches in height and shall be placed on a post. Individual units within a multiple dwelling complex shall be required to display a unit reflective number, which is three inches in height on the front door or immediately adjacent to the door.
(3)
On a corner lot, the house number shall face the street named in the address.
(4)
The address program administrator and program assistant, with the concurrence of the board of commissioners, will have the right to authorize and approve alternate methods of displaying numbers which meet the intent of this article when strict adherence to these standards cannot be met or is impractical.

(2)
Secondary numbers may be used when a number of units, structures and uses coexist on the same parcel of land. Examples of secondary numbers include apartment projects, mobile home parks, office parks, planned unit developments, recreational vehicle parks, recreational areas, shopping centers and other uses where the use of secondary numbers would clarify the location of a unit or use for public safety purposes. To provide secondary numbers, the address program administrator shall work with the owner, manager or person in charge of the project to determine a logical numbering system.
