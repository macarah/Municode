Sec. 82-73. - Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit duration.
An individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years from the effective date of the permit.

Sec. 82-74. - Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit contents.
An individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit shall include such conditions as are deemed reasonably necessary by the director to prevent pass through or interference, protect the quality of the water body receiving the treatment plant's effluent, protect worker health and safety, facilitate sludge management and disposal, and protect against damage to the POTW.
(a)
Individual wastewater discharge permits and general permits must contain:
(1)
A statement that indicates the permit issuance date, expiration date and effective date;
(2)
A statement that the permit is nontransferable without prior notification to Forsyth County in accordance with section 82-77 of this article, and provisions for furnishing the new owner or operator with a copy of the existing permit;

At a minimum, self-monitoring reports shall be submitted semi-annually during the months of June and December;
(5)
The process for seeking a waiver from monitoring for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge in accordance with section 82-84(b).

(8)
Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the director (section 82-84(b)) must be included as a condition in the user's permit.
(b)
Individual wastewater discharge permits and general permits may contain, but need not be limited to, the following conditions:
(1)
Limits on the average and/or maximum rate of discharge, time of discharge, and/or requirements for flow regulation and equalization;

Requirements for the installation of pretreatment technology, pollution control, or construction of appropriate containment devices, designed to reduce, eliminate, or prevent the introduction of pollutants into the treatment works;
(3)
Requirements for the development and implementation of spill control plans or other special conditions including management practices necessary to adequately prevent accidental, unanticipated, or non-routine discharges;
(4)
Development and implementation of waste minimization plans to reduce the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW;

(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-75. - Permit issuance process.
(a)
Public notification. For each new permit and substantial modification of an existing permit, the director will publish two notices in newspaper(s) of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice with the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW, or on the county's web page. First, the director shall publish a notice of intent to issue (or modify) an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit, at least 30 days prior to issuance. The notice will indicate a location where the draft permit may be reviewed and an address where written comments may be submitted. Second, the director shall publish a notice of final issuance (or modification) of a permit within 21 days of the issuance of the new (or substantially modified) permit. In addition to these public notices, the director shall provide individual notice and opportunity to comment to persons or groups who request notification of local limits development.
(b)
Permit appeals. Any person, including the user, may petition the director to reconsider the terms of an individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit within 30 days of final notice of its issuance or substantial modification.
(1)
Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.
(2)
In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit.
(3)
The effectiveness of the individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal.
(4)
If the director fails to act within 30 days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider an individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit, not to issue an individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit, or not to modify an individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit shall be considered final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)

Sec. 82-77. - Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit transfer.
Individual wastewater discharge permits and general permits may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least 60 days' advance notice to the director and the director approves the individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit transfer.

(b)
Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and

(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-78. - Individual wastewater discharge permit and general permit revocation.
