(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-58. - National Categorical Pretreatment Standards/local limits.
The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 403 and 405—471 are hereby incorporated.
(1)
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
(2)
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director may impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(3)
A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
(4)
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with CFR 403.15.
(5)
Upon the promulgation of a national categorical pretreatment standard for a particular pretreatment standard for a particular industrial subcategory, the national standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. All affected significant industrial users shall be subject to applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. Users shall immediately notify the POTW of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b) and then provide written notification within five days to the POTW according to federal regulations.
(6)
State limits. Users must comply with any applicable State of Georgia Pretreatment Standards.
(7)
Local limits. The following table lists the local limits adopted by Forsyth County. User discharge concentrations apply at the point where the waste is discharged to the sewage works. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following maximum allowable discharge limits:
(8)
Exceedance of the daily maximum discharge limit for lead shall necessitate meeting the monthly average discharge concentration limit for lead (0.002 mg/L). Exceedance of the daily maximum discharge limit for mercury shall necessitate meeting the monthly average discharge concentration limit for mercury (0.0001 mg/L).

Upon providing notice to affected persons, the county may impose concentration ranges and maximum concentrations in addition to, or in place of, those set forth above. The county reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the sewage works for the above-mentioned conventional pollutants and any other pollutant discharged by a user, where, in the opinion of the director, such action appears necessary in order for the POTW to achieve or maintain compliance with applicable state or federal standards, or in order for the director to promote the purposes and policies of this article.
(10)
Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or related requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-59. - Authority of the director.
The director is authorized to take actions that, in the opinion of the director, appear necessary in order for the POTW to achieve or maintain compliance with applicable state or federal standards, or in order for the director to promote the purposes and policies of this article. With regard to discharges into or from the POTW, and without limiting the foregoing, the director is authorized to take actions that, in the opinion of the director, appear necessary to avoid (i) harm or threatened harm to human health and safety, the environment, the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment, (ii) actual or threatened adverse effects on receiving streams; (iii) actual or threatened endangerment to life, limb or public property; or (iv) conditions that constitute a nuisance. Such actions may include, without limitation:
(1)
Rejecting the wastes;
(2)
Requiring pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;
(3)
Requiring control over the quantities and rates of discharge;
(4)
Designating that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers;
(5)
Requiring industrial users to relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge;
(6)
Requiring industrial users to separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams;
(7)
Requiring any person discharging into the sewage works to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization; and
(8)
Requiring surcharge payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of this document and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the sewage works and determine the industrial user's compliance with the requirements of this article.
If the director permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to review and approval by same and shall be subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-60. - Standards for interceptors (grease, sand and oil) for those facilities on the county sewer system.
(a)
Grease interceptor required. All food service establishments discharging to the county's sewerage system (or to a private sewer system approved by the county) shall install, operate, and maintain a sufficiently sized grease interceptor in order to achieve and maintain compliance with requirements set forth in this article. All grease interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the director and shall be so located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
(1)
Sizing: No single, gravity type, grease interceptor shall be smaller than 1,000 gallons or larger than 3,000 gallons. Hydromechanical type grease interceptors must be appropriately sized and installed according to the manufacturer's specifications for both normal and at peak flows. The hydromechanical grease interceptor must comply with comprehensive performance testing to nationally recognized standards such as PDI-G101, ASME A112.14.3 and CSA B481. All grease interceptors shall be designed and installed in accordance with county standards. The user shall submit plans to the county for review and comment. Outdoor grease interceptors (traps) shall have covers constructed of materials that will hold up to heavy traffic and be bolted, heavy enough, or otherwise secured to prevent unauthorized access. The installation shall be subject to inspection, by the county, prior to placing in service.
(2)
Maintenance: All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense to be in continuously efficient operation. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, sludges, and solids. Decanting or back flushing of the grease interceptor of its contents for the purpose of reducing the volume to be hauled is prohibited. Practices such as "blow-and-go", "pump-and-dump", skimming, recycling, or other similar practices are also prohibited.
(3)
Frequency of maintenance: All grease interceptors must be pumped out completely once every 90 days. Where, in the opinions of the director, such actions necessary for the POTW to achieve or maintain compliance with applicable state or federal standards, or in order for the director to promote the purposes and policies of this article, the director may, in writing, require the owner or operator of the grease interceptor to increase or decrease pumping frequency on a case-by-case basis.
(4)
Additives: The use of any additive, which emulsifies grease, is prohibited. Special permission may be granted by the director for "in-trap treatment" or addition of bacteria for treatment, but the process must be approved prior to installation.
(5)
Legal disposal: The user shall be responsible for the proper removal and legal disposal of the grease interceptor waste. All waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed of at a facility permitted by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division to receive such waste. Grease interceptor waste shall not be discharged to the county's sewerage system, WPCP, or in a manner that would endanger the waters of the State of Georgia, or in a manner that would cause any person or the POTW to be in violation of any applicable law, regulation or permit, including without limitation, the POTW's NPDES permit.
(6)
Manifests: The user shall be responsible for maintaining manifests detailing the dates of service and quantity of waste removed. The manifest shall include the waste hauler company name, address, and telephone number and the driver's name. The manifest shall include the ultimate disposal facility company name, address, and telephone number and the person receiving the waste and the quantity of waste received. The user shall acquire a completed copy of the manifest from the disposal facility with the proper signatures and dates within 15 days of the pumping activity. Upon receipt of the completed manifest, the user will email or mail a copy of the manifest to: pretreatmentinspector@forsythco.com

(7)
Grease interceptor maintenance company permits: All grease trap maintenance and hauling companies must obtain a permit from Forsyth County prior to conducting such activities in the county sewer system. A permit fee set by the county must be paid and a background check, on the grease interceptor maintenance company, must be conducted before a permit can be issued.
(b)
Grease, oil and sand separator: Grease, oil, and sand separator shall be provided when, in the opinion of the director, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful constituents. The grease, oil and sand separators shall be sized for proper operation at all times and shall be approved by the director.
(1)
Car washes, equipment washes, and related facilities: All car washes, heavy equipment washing facilities and related facilities are required to install and maintain a sand and oil separator as described above. In addition, all such new facilities shall install a washwater recycling system as approved by the county.
(c)

(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-61. - Operation and maintenance of pretreatment or flow equalizing facility.
(a)
Industrial users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this article, and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in this article within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or Forsyth County, whichever is more stringent. All facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to Forsyth County for review and shall be acceptable to the director before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the county under the provisions contained herein.
(b)
Prohibition of bypass. Except as otherwise provided in this article, bypass is prohibited and persons who cause bypass are subject to enforcement by the county. Upon reduction of efficiency of operation or loss or failure of all or part of the treatment facility, the permittee shall, to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with its permit, and applicable laws and regulations, control its production or discharges (or both) until operation of the treatment facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies, without limitation, when the primary source of power of the treatment facility fails or is reduced. It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with permit conditions.
(c)
Exceptions for bypass. Notwithstanding the foregoing, bypass is permissible in the following circumstances:
(1)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only where necessary for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the notice provisions contained in subsections (c)(2) and (d) below.
(2)
Provided that notice is given by the user to the county in accordance with subsection (d) below, bypass is permitted where, in the opinion of the director: (i) the bypass is unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage, (ii) allowing the bypass does not appear likely to result in loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage, (iii) the bypass appears unlikely to cause a failure (a) by the POTW to achieve or maintain compliance with applicable state or federal standards, or (b) by the director to promote the purposes and policies of this article; and (iv) there are or were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment down time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, bypass is prohibited if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment down time or preventive maintenance.
(d)
Notice of bypass.
(1)
If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, the user shall submit written notification to the county at least ten days before the date of the bypass and receive approval from the county prior to the bypass. Bypasses are prohibited during periods of wastewater treatment plant upset.
(2)
An industrial user shall submit oral notice to the county of any unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards immediately upon becoming aware of the bypass.
(3)
A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass, including:
a.
The exact dates and times of the bypass;
b.
The exact cause and a description of the bypass;
c.
If the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and
d.
Steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.

Sec. 82-63. - Accidental discharge/slug control plans.
At least once every two years, the director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, revise and implement such a plan, if in the opinion of the director, such plan appears necessary in order for the POTW to achieve or maintain compliance with applicable state or federal standards, or in order for the director to promote the purposes and policies of this article. Alternately, the director may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
(1)
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges.
(2)
Description of stored chemicals.
(3)
Procedures for immediately notifying the county of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by section 82-86 of this document.
(4)
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental spill or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
(5)
Posted notices required: Posted notice of procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental discharge or slug loading shall be provided by the user in the location of potential discharge problem areas, sewer drains, pretreatment facilities, or other areas required by the county.

Sec. 82-64. - Hauled wastewater.
(a)
Restricted. It shall be unlawful to empty, dump, throw or otherwise discharge, into any manhole, catch basin or other opening, into the Forsyth County sewer system, or any system connected with and discharging into the sewer system, the contents of any septic tank, sludge, sewage, or other similar matter or material, except as provided in subsection (b) hereof.
(b)
Permits. The director is hereby authorized to grant permits to discharge the contents of septic tanks at locations specified by the director and under supervision of Forsyth County personnel. Septic tank pumpage will not be accepted from areas outside the boundaries of Forsyth County. Such permits may be revoked at any time if, in the opinion of the director, (i) continued dumping of such matter into the sewers appears likely to result in injury or threatened injury to the sewer system, sewage works, or treatment processes, or (ii) revocation of the permit appears necessary in order for the POTW to achieve or maintain compliance with applicable state or federal standards, or in order for the director to promote the purposes and policies of this article. In conjunction with permits, the hauler shall be required to pay an annual hauling permit fee set by Forsyth County.
(c)
Waste haulers will be required to carry liability insurance, and to provide evidence of same to the county, in such amounts and forms as determined by the county. Such insurance shall afford compensation for taking corrective action and for bodily injury, and for property damage to third persons caused by hauler negligence and/or accidents.
(d)
The director may prohibit the disposal of hauled waste of unusual strength or character. No hauled waste shall be accepted that violates federal, state, or local regulations or threatens to cause the county's WPCP to violate its NPDES permit, to violate Georgia water quality standards, or to contaminate its WPCP sludge.
(e)
Samples of hauled waste shall be provided in order to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The director may require industrial waste haulers to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
(f)
Waste haulers must provide a waste tracking form (manifest) for every load. Forms shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names, addresses, and signature of each waste generator, and volume and characteristics of waste. For hauled industrial or commercial waste, the form shall identify the type of industrial or commercial establishment, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are "hazardous wastes" as set forth in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") 42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq., as amended, or as set forth in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act ("GHWMA"), O.C.G.A. § 12-8-60 et seq., as amended.
(g)
Waste haulers must provide prior notification to the director of the intent to discharge, and the actual discharge must be performed under the supervision of certified wastewater treatment plant personnel.
(h)
Waste haulers shall pay a waste hauler discharge fee as established by Forsyth County.

This article shall not be construed as preventing the county from authorizing and accepting for treatment, subject to reasonable conditions and limitations, the discharge of an industrial waste of unusual strength or character, where in the opinion of the director, the acceptance and treatment of such discharge appears unlikely to cause a failure (i) by the POTW to achieve or maintain compliance with applicable state or federal standards, or (ii) by the director to promote the purposes and policies of this article. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the industrial waste shall be subject to applicable surcharges levied on the industrial concern, and no waiver of National Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall be given for any reason.
The director shall prepare and maintain a list of its industrial users, including non-significant categorical industrial users meeting the criteria in § 403.3(v)(1). The list shall identify the criteria in § 403.3(v)(1) applicable to each industrial user and, where applicable, shall also indicate whether the POTW has made a determination pursuant to § 403.3(v)(2) that such industrial user should not be considered a significant industrial user. The initial list shall be submitted to the approval authority pursuant to § 403.9 or as a non-substantial modification pursuant to § 403.18(d). Modifications to the list shall be submitted to the approval authority pursuant to § 403.12(i)(1). (40 CFR 403.8(f)(6))
