State Law reference— Code of ethics for government service, O.C.G.A. § 45-10-1 et seq.; Code of Ethics for members of boards, commissions and authorities, O.C.G.A. § 45-10-3.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 2-61. - Findings.
(a)
The Constitution of the State of Georgia, approved by the voters of the state in November 1982 and effective July 1, 1983, provides in article IX, section II, paragraph I thereof, that the governing authority of the county may adopt clearly reasonable ordinances, resolutions, and regulations.
(b)
O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20 authorizes counties to enact ordinances for protecting and preserving the public health, safety, and welfare of the population of the unincorporated areas of the county.
(c)
The board of commissioners, desires to exercise its authority in adopting this article.
(d)
It is essential to the proper operation of democratic government that public officials be independent and impartial, that governmental decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure, that public office not be used for private gain other than the remuneration provided by law, and that there be public confidence in the integrity of government.
(e)
The attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists a conflict between the private interests of an elected official or a governmental employee and his duties.
(f)
The public interest, therefore, requires that the law protect against such conflicts of interest and establish appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of elected officials and government employees in situations where conflicts exist.
(g)
It is also essential to the proper operation of government that those best qualified be encouraged to serve the government. Accordingly, legal safeguards against conflicts of interest must be so designed as not unnecessarily or unreasonably to impede the recruitment and retention by the government of those men and women who are best qualified to serve it.
(h)
An essential principle underlying the staffing of our government structure is that its elected officials and employees should not be denied the opportunity, available to all other citizens, to acquire and retain private economic and other interests, except where conflicts with the responsibility of such elected officials and employees to the public cannot be avoided.
(i)
In recognition of these goals and principles, it is the policy of the board of commissioners to institute, establish, promote, and enforce standards of ethical conduct for all of the county's officers and employees.
(j)
It is a further policy of the board of commissioners that the proper administration of the county's government and the promotion and enforcement of standards of ethical conduct for the county's officers and employees would be best served by the creation of a county ethics panel for the investigation of complaints related to ethical standards.

Sec. 2-124. - Complaints.
Ethics panels shall be responsible for hearing and deciding any complaints filed regarding alleged violations of this Code of Ethics by any person. The following procedures shall be followed when filing a complaint:
(1)
Any person may file a complaint alleging a violation of any of the provisions of this Code of Ethics by submitting it to the ethics panel clerk. A copy of such complaint shall be immediately delivered by hand, facsimile or email to the county official or employee against whom the complaint was filed with a second copy being provided to the county office or employee by registered mail. The complaint must be supported by affidavits based on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. All documents referred to in an affidavit should be attached to the affidavit. The person filing the complaint shall verify the complaint by his signature thereon. Every ethics complaint shall be signed and notarized, and shall contain the following statement:
"I have read the ethics complaint and aver that the facts contained therein are true to the best of my knowledge and belief."
The complaint must contain the full legal name of the complainant along with a current valid mailing address, phone number, and, if applicable, an email address.
A complaint must be filed within six months of the date the alleged violation is said to have occurred, or in case of concealment or nondisclosure within six months of the date the alleged violation should have been discovered after due diligence. If the ethics panel clerk makes an initial determination that a complaint is technically deficient, the ethics panel clerk shall submit a list of the deficiencies to the complainant and offer the complainant the opportunity to correct the deficiencies within seven days prior to the complaint being dismissed on technical grounds. For purposes of this Code of Ethics, "technical deficiencies" shall mean that the complaint is not supported by affidavits based on personal knowledge, is not signed and notarized, pertains to conduct occurring more than six months prior to the complaint being filed or contains no statement that the conduct was concealed or non-disclosed, or does not contain the full legal name, mailing address, or phone number of the complaining party. Unremedied technical deficiencies shall authorize the ethics panel clerk to dismiss the complaint.
(2)
Upon receipt of a complaint alleging misconduct, the county official or employee against whom the complaint was filed may reply to the complaint within 30 days, unless such time for reply is extended by the ethics panel upon good cause shown. The response of the county official or employee must be supported by affidavits based on personal knowledge, must set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and must show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. All documents referred to in an affidavit should be attached to the affidavit.
(3)
Within 60 days of receipt of a complaint, the ethics panel shall conduct an investigatory review to determine whether specific substantiated evidence from a creditable source(s) exits to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this Code of Ethics. In addition to any notice required under the Georgia Open Meetings Act, the clerk shall provide written notice to the party tendering the complaint, and the official or employee that is the subject of the complaint, of the date, time and location of the ethics panel meeting where the investigatory review is to be conducted. This notice shall be provided via statutory overnight or certified mail delivered to the residence or other provided address of the respective party, with said notice to be received a reasonable time and in no event less than two days prior to the date of said meeting. The above notice notwithstanding, neither the complaining nor responding party shall be entitled to make a presentation or otherwise address the ethics panel during the investigatory review meeting. The opportunity for presenting evidence and otherwise addressing the ethics panel shall occur in accord with subsection (4) of this section. If after reviewing the complaint the ethics panel by majority vote determines that no specific, substantiated evidence from a credible source(s) exists to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this Code of Ethics or determines that no violation occurred, it may dismiss the complaint without further proceedings. In the event a complaint is dismissed based upon the merits of the complaint, the complaint may not be re-filed.
(4)
If the ethics panel determines that specific, substantiated evidence from a creditable source exists to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this Code of Ethics, certified written notice of a hearing, containing the time, date and place of such hearing, shall be given to each party by the ethics panel, and a formal public hearing shall be conducted and both parties afforded an opportunity to be heard. Any formal public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of due process. The ethics panel is authorized to swear witnesses.
(5)
Any final determination resulting from the hearing shall include written findings of fact and conclusions of law. The ethics panel shall determine if clear and convincing evidence shows any violation of this Code of Ethics.
(6)
In the event an ethics complaint brought against a county official or employee (both hereafter referred to as "respondent") arising out of their official duties is dismissed, the respondent shall be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in defending said ethics complaint. Upon securing a final determination by the ethics panel of the complaint being dismissed, the respondent shall submit a copy of the order making such findings to the Forsyth County Manager along with a copy of all applicable itemized attorneys' fees and costs incurred in defending same. The itemized attorney's fees and costs shall have attorney time and tasks broken down in 1/10 of an hour increments along with the attorney's hourly fee, paralegal costs and all other itemized costs coupled with a sworn statement by the attorney that the amount submitted for repayment is the same amount for which the Respondent would otherwise have been responsible. No paralegal or other expenses shall be subject to reimbursement.
The county manager shall submit, within three business days of receipt, the attorney fee statement to the county attorney for a determination of reasonableness, of which determination shall be provided in writing (or email) to the county manager and respondent within business days. Upon the fees being deemed reasonable, the county manager shall submit all documentation to the department of finance for issuance of a reimbursement check to the respondent or respondent's attorney, at respondent's sole discretion, with reimbursement payment occurring within ten days from the date of the county attorneys' determination notification. In no event shall reimbursement under this paragraph exceed $10,000.00.

In addition, the court may issue an order to cease and desist from the violation of this Code of Ethics. The court may also void an official action that is the subject of the violation, provided that the legal action to void the matter was brought within 90 days of the occurrence of the official action, if the court deems voiding the action to be in the best interest of the public. The court, after hearing and considering all the circumstances in the case, may grant all or part of the relief sought. However, the court may not void any official action appropriating public funds, levying taxes or providing for the issuance of bonds, notes or other evidences of public obligation under this Code of Ethics.
(d)
In addition to any other remedy provided in this Code of Ethics, upon determination of a violation of this Code of Ethics, an ethics panel may recommend to the board of commissioners in writing that any contract, bid, or change order that was the subject of the violation should be cancelled or rescinded. The board of commissioners, however, shall retain the discretion to determine whether such a cancellation or rescission would be in the best interest of the county and shall not be bound in any way by a recommendation of an ethics panel.
