Sec. 30-31. - Findings.
(a)
By virtue of O.C.G.A. § 46-5-133, the governing authority of any local government which operates or which contracts for the operation of an emergency 911 system is authorized to adopt a resolution to impose a monthly 911 charge upon each telephone service subscribed to by telephone subscribers whose exchange access lines are in the areas served or which would be served by the 911 service.
(b)
By virtue of O.C.GA. § 46-5-133, the governing authority of any local government which operates or which contracts for the operation of a public safety answering point that is capable of providing or provides automatic number identification and enhanced location information is authorized to adopt a resolution to impose a monthly wireless enhanced 911 charge upon each wireless telecommunications connection subscriber whose place of primary use is within the geographic area served by the county's public safety answering point.
(c)
The board of commissioners has deemed the enhancement of emergency 911 service within the county to be necessary and of the utmost importance in order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry by shortening the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid as well as the response time to situations requiring law enforcement, fire, medical, rescue, and other emergency services resulting in the saving of lives, a reduction in the destruction of property, and quicker apprehension of criminals.
(d)
Appropriate notice and hearings on this article have been carried out.

For the enhancement of emergency 911 service within the county, there shall be imposed a monthly 911 charge upon each telephone service subscribed to by telephone subscribers within the county whose exchange access lines are in the areas served or which would be served by the 911 service.

Sec. 30-33. - Billing and collection of charges.
(a)
The subscriber of an exchange access facility may be billed for the monthly 911 charges imposed with respect to that facility by the service supplier. Such 911 charge shall be $1.50 per month per telephone service provided to the telephone subscriber. All telephone services billed to federal, state, or local governments shall be exempt from the 911 charge. Each service supplier shall, on behalf of the county, collect the 911 charge from those telephone subscribers to whom it provides telephone service within the area served by the county's emergency 911 system. As part of its normal monthly billing process, the service supplier shall collect the 911 charge as a separate entry on each bill. If a service supplier receives a partial payment for a monthly bill from a telephone subscriber, the service supplier shall apply the payment against the amount the telephone subscriber owes the service supplier first.
(b)
The subscriber of a wireless telecommunications connection whose place of primary use is within the geographic area that is served by the county or that would be served by the county for the purpose of the county's public safety answering point may be billed for the monthly wireless enhanced 911 charge imposed with respect to that connection by the wireless service supplier. Such wireless enhanced 911 charge shall be $1.50 per month per wireless telecommunications connection subscriber. All wireless telecommunications connections billed to federal, state, or local governments shall be exempt from the wireless enhanced 911 charge. Each wireless service supplier shall, on behalf of the county, collect the wireless enhanced 911 charge from those telephone subscribers whose place of primary use is within the geographic area served by the county's emergency 911 system. As part of its normal monthly billing process, the wireless service supplier shall collect the wireless enhanced 911 charge as a separate entry on each bill. If a service supplier receives a partial payment for a monthly bill from a telephone subscriber, the service supplier shall apply the payment against the amount the telephone subscriber owes the service supplier first.

Every subscriber of a wireless telecommunications connection whose place of primary use is within the geographic area that is or that would be served by the county. A service supplier shall have no obligation to take any legal action to enforce the collection of the 911 charge or wireless enhanced 911 charge. The service supplier shall provide the county board of commissioners within 60 days with the name and address of each subscriber who has refused to pay the 911 charge or wireless enhanced 911 charge after such 911 charge or wireless enhanced 911 charge has become due.

The 911 charges and wireless enhanced 911 charges collected by the service supplier shall be deposited and accounted for in a separate restricted revenue fund known as the emergency telephone system fund maintained by the county.
