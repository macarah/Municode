DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 46-31. - Statutory authorization.
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, Forsyth County, Georgia, does ordain this article and establishes this set for floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.
(Ord. No. 55-F, § 1(Exh. A), 4-18-2019)
Sec. 46-32. - Findings of fact.
(1)
The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(2)
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(3)
Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas.
(Ord. No. 55-F, § 1(Exh. A), 4-18-2019)
Sec. 46-33. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to protect, restrain and enhance the public health, safety, environment, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(5)
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(6)
Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.
(Ord. No. 55-F, § 1(Exh. A), 4-18-2019)
Sec. 46-34. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are:
(1)
To protect human life and health;
(2)
To minimize damage to private property;
(3)
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges, located in floodplains;
(4)
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(5)
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(6)
To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(7)
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and
(8)
To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Sec. 46-74. - Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments.
An engineering study is required, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways for which the provisions of section 46-85 apply. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer licensed in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This study shall be submitted to and approved by the Forsyth County Engineering Department prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include:
(1)
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
(2)
Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the Forsyth County Engineering Department. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles;
(3)
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development;
(4)
A preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments.
(Ord. No. 55-F, § 1(Exh. A), 4-18-2019)
Sec. 46-75. - Floodway encroachments.
Located within SFHA are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to high velocity flood flows, debris, or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development are prohibited within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) below;
(2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and;
(3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the Forsyth County Department of Engineering until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the Forsyth County Department of Engineering.

A finding of good and sufficient cause;
2.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
3.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
b.
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
c.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage, resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation.
d.
The director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, both granted and denied, and report any variances to FEMA upon request.
(7)
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the Forsyth County Zoning Board of Appeals shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.
