Secs. 18-12—18-29. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - PROHIBITION ON THE USE, SALE, OR DELIVERY OF CERTAIN DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES AND ASSOCIATED PARAPHERNALIA

Sec. 18-30. - Purpose.
(a)
The mayor and city council has been informed about the presence of potentially dangerous substances affecting the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens, particularly the youth, of the city. In response to these warnings, the mayor and city council have been provided information indicating that this threat is presented in the form of products sold or distributed as a mixture of dried vegetation that, when covered, sprayed, or mixed with certain specific chemicals, produces the physiological and psychological effects of a controlled substance such as marijuana.
(b)
Such substances are reported to cause hallucinations, vomiting, agitation, panic attacks, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, pallor, numbness and tingling, disorientation, loss of time awareness, and in some cases, tremors and seizures.
(c)
These substances are generally described as synthetic cannabinoids of salvia divinorum distributed, sold, and marketed under such names as "K-3," "K-2," "K-2 Summit," "Genie," "Dascents," "Zohai," "Sage," "Spice," "Ko Knockout 2," "Spice Gold," "Spice Diamond," "Yucatan Fire," "Solar Flare," "Pep Spice," "Fire 'n' Ice," "Black Magic Smoke," "Salvia Divinorum," "Extreme Potpourri," and "Phat Cat."
(d)
The substances described in subsection (c) of this section may be marked as incense, but are commonly being used as an alternative to marijuana, which is an identified and documented controlled substance, the sale and use of which is prohibited under the laws of the state and of the United States. These synthetic cannabinoid substances may be presented under a variety of street names, but share common ingredients including JWH018 and JWH073. Salvia divinorum contains the ingredient known as salvinorum A. These unregulated synthetic cannabinoids and salvia divinorum produce a very potent, intoxicating effect which is estimated by the medical community to produce effects ranging from three to 100 times greater and more potent than THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.
(e)
The substances identified in this section manifest all of the demonstrated attributes that deprive persons of judgment, coordination, and the ability to conduct themselves in a safe and appropriate manner in modern society. The available medical and law enforcement information on these products indicate that a person under the effects of these substances may be a clear and present danger to themselves and others.
