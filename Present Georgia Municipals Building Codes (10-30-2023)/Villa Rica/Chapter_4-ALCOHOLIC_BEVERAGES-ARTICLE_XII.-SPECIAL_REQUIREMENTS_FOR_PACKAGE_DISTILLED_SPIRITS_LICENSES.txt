(Ord. No. 0-33-2022 , 4-12-2022)
Sec. 4-402. - Number of distilled spirits retail licenses permitted.
(a)
The initial number of licenses to be issued in the city shall be four. After the initial issuance of licenses within the city, the city will not accept any additional applications for the retail sale of distilled by the package, and no additional license for the retail sale of distilled spirits by the package shall be issued except as provided herein.
(b)
The city has determined that it is in the best interest of the citizens to space the grant of licenses throughout the city so that no single area within the city shall be burdened with multiple license holders for the retail sale of distilled spirits by the package. Accordingly, the council may by resolution divide the city into districts for the issuance of the initial licenses and subsequent licenses as provided below. The city may restrict the issuance of licenses to one per district. The initial district map is attached to the ordinance from which this article derived and is incorporated by reference herein.
(c)
Additional licenses may be issued as the city increases in population. It is contemplated that a fifth license may be issued at such time as the city's population reaches 25,000 according to the U.S. Census or the projection of the American Community Survey of U.S. Census Bureau. Similarly, a sixth license may be issued with the city's population reaches 30,000 and a seventh license at 35,000. The city shall revise the district map as those milestones are reached.
(d)
If at any time and for whatever reason the number of active licenses for the retail sale of distilled spirits by the package falls below the number currently allowed by the ordinance then the city shall accept applications for and issue such additional licenses for the retail sale of distilled spirits so as to bring the total number of active licenses for the retail sale of distilled spirits by the package and the maximum number then allowed by this ordinance. Any such licenses shall be issued based on the district map.
(e)
For the initial issuance of licenses pursuant to this section and for the issuance of additional licenses pursuant to subsection (c) above or for any districts for which a license may be available, the city shall by resolution establish a date by which applications for the license must be submitted. The application must be complete to be considered for issuance.
(f)
If the city receives more applications than allotted licenses to be issued per district under this section which applications comply with the standards for the issuance of licenses for the sale of package distilled spirits set forth in this chapter, then the selection of the successful applications shall be conducted by a lottery system overseen by an independent third party. The application drawn from the lottery system shall then be presented to the city council for action in accordance with the terms of this chapter.
Lotteries for the issuance of licenses in the individual districts shall be held on a staggered basis.
(g)
The lottery system shall select a first, second, and third place within each district. In the event the application of the first place finisher is not approved by the major and council pursuant to section 4-29 of this ordinance, then the subsequent finishers will be considered sequentially by the mayor and council until the license is issued.
(h)
No license for the retail sale of distilled spirits by the percentage shall be issued to any site located within the downtown overlay district.
(i)
Licenses limited to one per family or corporation.
(1)
No person and/or member of his family and/or corporation shall own, hold or control any interest whatsoever in more than one license in the city to engage in the business of selling liquor by the package at retail.
(2)
As used in this section, an interest in the license shall be deemed to exist if the person involved is the outright owner of the license, a co-owner of a license, a general or limited partner in a partnership which owns all or any part of a license, a stockholder in any corporation which owns all or any part of a license, an owner, a lessor, sublessor, or stockholder in any corporation owning or leasing, any real estate which is occupied by a retail liquor store, or shares in any income or corpus of any trust fund or estate having any interest in a retail liquor store.
(3)
All applications for a license made on forms provided by the city clerk, whether original or for renewal, must be accompanied by a full and complete statement under oath of information relative to any and all interests, as hereinbefore defined in subsection (b), in retail liquor stores. This shall include the names and addresses of all persons interested in the ownership of the business of selling packaged liquor at retail, together with any interest each person or members of his family has in any other retail liquor store; the ownership of the land and building where such retail business is operated; the amount of rental paid for such land and building and the manner in which the same is determined and to whom and at what intervals it is paid; the name and address (by affidavit from owner, lessor or sublessor of such land and building) of all persons having any whole, partial, beneficial or any other interest in and to the land and building on and in which said retail liquor store is to be located; a copy of the proposed lease, and any other information requested by the police department or the city council pertinent to the application under investigation.
