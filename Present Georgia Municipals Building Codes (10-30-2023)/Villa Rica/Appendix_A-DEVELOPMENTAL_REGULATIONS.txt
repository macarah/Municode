402.7
Easement Acquisition and Utility Encroachment Permits:
A.
It shall be the responsibility of the developer to obtain any off-site easements required to connect the project to existing public sewers. Easements will be conveyed to the City of Villa Rica for all facilities which are to be conveyed to the city. This process must be started early enough to allow construction of the sewer before any building construction is to begin. No building permits or sewer tap applications can be issued until off-site sewers have been constructed and accepted. This condition shall override any provision for speed up of house starts such as furnishing a bond to guarantee completion of the streets and other appurtenances.
B.
All easements shall allow adequate room to construct the sewer and appurtenances. Permanent easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide, ten feet on each side of the line; except that when the depth of the sewer exceeds ten feet the required sewer easement width shall increase such that the easement width is at least twice the depth from the ground surface to bottom of the pipe. Designs involving utilities sharing a common easement will be coordinated with the utilities to insure adequate separation of utilities and overall easement width is achieved.
C.
Easement drawings for work outside the development shall be furnished and recorded prior to approval of the sewer plans. The drawings shall be of a size suitable for legal recording and shall be prepared by a Registered Land Surveyor. The drawing will show property lines, the name of property owners with the length of line encroaching on each property owner, size of line, line designation, manhole numbers and stations, width of permanent and construction easement, scale of drawing, north arrow, land lot and district numbers, and a tie to the nearest land lot corner. Any streets or other existing easements shall also be shown.
The title block shall be shown as follows:

The engineer shall furnish appropriate drawings for any submittal to agencies such as any state or federal highways, railroads, power lines, water lines, gas lines, petroleum lines, or any other utility lines on which the sewer construction will encroach. The drawing shall normally be 8-1/2" X 11" or 8-1/2" X 14" and shall show a plan view and profile view. The drawing will show the same information required for easement drawings. Also, the drawing will show the right-of-way of the existing street or utility, the owner's designation of the line, the name or number of the nearest intersection or mile-post or tower number and the distance to that appurtenance. The clearance distance between the street surface, or the bottom of the rail, or the utility and the sewer will be shown. The drawing will show the type of material to be used for the sewer and the method of construction to be used. The drawing will also contain any other special information required by the controlling authority of the facility on which the sewer is encroaching. A minimum of five copies of the utility encroachment drawing will be furnished with the plans when they are submitted for approval. The engineer is also responsible for furnishing a completed encroachment permit application ready for signature by Department Superintendent. Construction permits will not be issued until the utility encroachment permit has been obtained and until any special conditions such as insurance requirements have been complied with.
(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018)
403. - Design Criteria and Materials for Sewers.
403.1
General: The criteria listed herein is not intended to cover all aspects of design, but rather to mention the basic guidelines and those particulars that are required by the City of Villa Rica Water and Sewer Department. For more detailed criteria, the reader should refer to standard references such as "Ten States Standards," Georgia EPD rules, Water Pollution Environment Federation Manual of Practice NO. FD-5, and other available literature.
403.2
Types of Sewers: All sewers for the conveyance of wastewater shall be designed as separate sanitary sewers in which groundwater, stormwater or other runoff from roofs, streets, parking lots, foundation drains and any source other than wastewater are excluded. Overflows from sewers shall not be permitted.
403.3
Design Period: Gravity sewer pipelines should, as a minimum, be designed with capacity sufficient to handle the estimated tributary population. Tributary population is considered to be all areas upstream of the discharge point of the system being designed as well as any anticipated pumped flow from other basins. Sewers will be designed and installed to the uppermost property line of the development being served. Consideration should be given to the maximum anticipated capacity of institutions, industrial parks, etc.
403.4
Capacity and Size Determinations: In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the following factors should be considered:
1.
Maximum hourly sewage flow.
2.
Additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants.
3.
Ground water infiltration.
4.
Topography of the area.
5.
Depth of excavation.
New sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than 400 gallons per household per day. Normally, all sewers shall be designed for a peak flow of not less than two and one-half times the average flow; this peak factor will be higher for smaller basins (see design guides). Sewers should be designed to carry the peak flow when flowing at a depth of two-thirds pipe diameter. The city land use plan should be consulted and special consideration given to commercial and industrial areas. Where developers are installing major trunk lines or interceptor sewers, the city's long-range plan should be consulted as a guide and the sewer should as a minimum be of the size called for in the long-range plan. If proposed land use conditions have changed subsequent to the plan, these changes should be factored into the determination.
403.5
Special City Requirements:
A.
Distance Between Manholes: Maximum distance between manholes shall be 400 feet.
B.
Depth: Any sewers installed in the street shall, topography permitting, be sufficiently deep to provide five feet of cover over service laterals at the street right-of-way, and over any part of the main or service within the street right-of-way. The maximum depth for PVC pipe shall be 15 feet, depths in excess of this shall be ductile iron. Sewers installed in streets shall have maximum depth of 12 feet. Any sewers on off street easements shall have a minimum of four feet of cover unless ductile iron pipe is used. Filling over the pipe to obtain minimum cover is not allowed.
C.
Drop Across Manholes: All manholes shall be provided with, a minimum vertical drop across the manhole (between in and out pipes) of 0.10 feet.
D.
Detection tape shall be installed over all sewer pipe. Bury tape 18 to 24 inches below grade. Use detection wire on all service laterals.
403.6
Slope: All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than 2.0 feet per second based on Manning's formula using an "n" value of 0.013. The following are the minimum slopes which should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable:
EXPAND
Minimum Slope in Feet
Sewer Size Per 100 Feet
8" 0.40
10" 0.29
12" 0.22
14" 0.17
15" 0.15
16" 0.14
18" 0.12
21" 0.10
24" 0.08
  These minimum slopes will be used only when sufficient flows are expected to maintain a velocity of 2.0 feet per second and maintain a cleaning action in the line. Sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sewers on 20 percent slope or greater shall be ductile iron pipe and shall be anchored securely with concrete anchors (See Standard Details) to prevent displacement by erosion or shock. Maximum slope of sewers shall be 30 percent and sewers shall be designed at less than 20 percent whenever possible.
403.7
Increasing Size: When a small sewer is connected to a large one, the connection shall not be lower than matching the top of both sewers to the same elevation.
403.8

Gravity sanitary sewer pipe up through 15-inch diameter will normally be Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), solid wall type SDR 35 thickness meeting ASTM D3034. Ductile Iron Pipe (DIP) will be used where certain conditions exist (see discussion of D.I.P.). For 18-inch diameter pipe and above, the Contractor may have the option of using either Polyvinyl Chloride (P.V.C.), Reinforced Concrete Pipe (R.C.P.), or Ductile Iron Pipe. The city may approve other types of pipe on a case by case basis and may limit the options of type of pipe depending on site conditions. This should be addressed at the preliminary review stage.
Bedding for sewer pipe shall be as follows (also see city standard details):
For PVC the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six inches below bottom of pipe extending up to six inches above top of pipe for the full width of the trench.
For Concrete and Ductile Iron pipe the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six inches below bottom of pipe extending up to the top of pipe. In wet areas, the minimum bedding requirements will be increased as required to ensure a stable support under the pipe and on the sides of the pipe.

404. - Construction Methods.
404.1
Licensing and Safety: All contractors who work on sewer systems that will be owned by the City of Villa Rica must be licensed in accordance with State of Georgia law and local ordinance. Compliance with applicable safety regulations is the responsibility of each company engaged in the work; the city assumes no responsibility for the actions of others on the job site. It is the responsibility of those installing sanitary sewers, lift stations and related appurtenances to conform to OSHA regulations, 29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart P, Paragraph 1926.650 through 1926.653. Publications from OSHA can be obtained by contacting OSHA Publications Distribution, Washington, D.C.
404.2
Construction Permits: No construction shall be allowed until a construction permit has been issued by the City of Villa Rica.
The contractor shall submit one copy of the approved construction plans which have been stamped approved. The contractor shall furnish his name and address, telephone number. He shall also furnish the name of the person in charge of the project and any subcontractors and the name and telephone number of a responsible person who can be contacted in case of emergencies during nonworking hours.
The contractor shall furnish his construction schedule and shall notify the City 24 hours prior to doing any work. Once the contractor begins work, he shall proceed in a workmanlike manner and shall complete the work in a reasonable time without undue off days and periods of inactivity which make it hard for the City to keep up with his activity.
404.3
Changes from Approved Plans: Any major changes from the approved plans will require that the engineer submit revised drawings along with a request explaining the reason for the change prior to construction of the change. Any deviation from City of Villa Rica standards will be considered a major change as will any change that will affect capacity, longevity, operation or maintenance of the facility. Any deviation from approved materials will not be accepted without prior approval.
404.4
Trench Excavation: Sewer lines shall normally be installed by open-cut trench excavation. Trenches shall be cut true to the lines and grades shown on the plans.
Pipe trenches shall not be excavated more than 100 feet in advance of pipe laying, and all work shall be performed to cause the least possible inconvenience to the public. Adequate temporary bridges or crossings shall be constructed and maintained where required to permit uninterrupted vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
All excavations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights in compliance with all OSHA and Georgia Department of Transportation requirements so as to protect the public and workers from hazard.
Excavations adjacent to existing or proposed buildings and structures, or in paved streets or alleys shall be adequately protected by the use of trench boxes, sheeting, shoring and bracing to prevent cave-ins of the excavation, or the undermining or subsequent settlement of adjacent structures or pavements. Underpinning of adjacent structures shall be done when necessary to maintain structures in safe condition.
Streets, sidewalks, landscapes, and other public and private property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored to as near as original condition as possible or better in a manner satisfactory to the City.
Trenches shall be kept free of water by pumping or well-pointing, as determined by the contractor. No structure shall be built or pipe shall be laid in water. Water shall not be allowed to flow over or rise upon any concrete, masonry or pipe until the same has been inspected and the concrete or joint material has thoroughly set. All water pumped, bailed, or otherwise removed from the trench or other excavation shall be conveyed in a proper manner to a suitable place of discharge. Such discharge shall not cause injury to public health, property, work completed, work in progress, or to any street surface, or cause any interference with the use of same by the public.
Construction occurring around active sewer systems shall be done in such a way so as to prevent the spillage of wastewater.
404.5
Rock Excavation: Drilling and blasting operations shall be conducted with due regard for the safety of persons and property in the vicinity and in strict conformity with requirements of all ordinances, laws and regulations governing blasting and the use of explosives. Rock excavation near existing pipelines or other structures shall be conducted with the utmost care to avoid damage. Injury or damage to other structures and properties are the sole responsibility of the installation contractor and shall be promptly repaired by the Contractor to the satisfaction of the City and property owner.
Rock in trenches shall be excavated over the horizontal limits of excavation and to depths as follows:
EXPAND
Size of Pipeline Inches Depth of Excavation Below Bottom of Sewer Pipe, Inches
4 to 8 6
8 to 18 8
18 to 30 10
  The undercut space shall then be brought up to grade by backfilling with Size #57 crushed stone material or approved equal.
404.6
Installation of Sewer Pipe: Construction stake-out will be required prior to construction of sewer lines. As a minimum, the horizontal alignment will be staked at 100-foot intervals and each manhole will be located with a centerline stake and two offset hubs. "Cuts" to invert elevations will be shown for each manhole entry and exit pipe. A copy of the stake-out notes will be provided to the city.
Pipe and accessories shall at all times be handled with care to avoid damage. Whether moved by hand, skidways or hoists, material shall not be dropped or bumped. The interior of all pipe shall be kept free from dirt and foreign matter at all times. Each joint of pipe shall be unloaded opposite or near the place where it is to be laid in the trench.
All such material that is defective in manufacture or has been damaged in transit or after delivery shall be removed from the job site.
Sewer pipes shall be joined by "push-on" joints using elastomeric gaskets to affect the pressure seal. The ends of pipe to be joined and the gaskets shall be cleaned immediately before assembly, and the assembly shall be made as recommended by the pipe manufacturer. Lubricant used must be non-toxic and supplied or approved for use by the pipe manufacturer. Sewer pipes shall be laid in the uphill direction with the bells pointing upgrade. Any variation from this procedure shall require approval from the City.
When pipe laying is not in progress, the open ends of installed pipe shall be plugged with a watertight plug to prevent entrance of trench water into the line.
Bedding for pipe shall normally be as listed below (also see city standard details):
For PVC the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six inches below bottom of pipe. For concrete and ductile iron pipe the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six inches below bottom of pipe and initial backfill to the top of pipe for the full width of the trench.
In wet areas, the minimum bedding requirements will be increased as required to ensure a stable support under the pipe and on the sides of the pipe.
Backfill material up to 12 inches above the top of the pipe shall be compacted dry, loose, soil unless PVC is used in which case the first six inches above the top of pipe is required to be crushed stone. If such material is not available from the site then #57 stone shall be used to backfill up to 12 inches above the top of the pipe. Backfilling the remainder of the trench may utilize soil and blasted rock (not over 12 inches in any dimension) compacted sufficiently to avoid excessive settlement. Under no circumstances will tree parts, vegetation, building materials or any other type of debris be used for backfill.
All backfill beneath roads, sidewalks or other critical areas shall be compacted to 95 percent Standard Proctor or as otherwise required by the D.O.T. or other such agency having jurisdiction using mechanical tamping equipment. Moisture control of the material may be required to achieve this compaction and hauling in of select material may be required. Compaction testing and certification by an independent soil testing company will be required in these areas at the Developers expense.
404.7

Utility lines or services damaged by the Contractor shall be repaired by the Contractor at the Contractor's own expense. The Contractor has sole responsibility of complying with all provisions of the Utilities Protection Code.
404.13
Protection of Water Supply and Other Utilities: The City of Villa Rica has an established Cross-Connection Program to prevent the entry of contaminants or pollutants into any area of the potable water supply through the control of cross connections. It is illegal to introduce any substance into or to have any cross connections with the potable water supply. There shall be no physical connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sanitary sewer which would permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable water supply.
Whenever possible, sewers should be laid at least ten feet horizontally from any existing or proposed water main. Should conditions prevent a separation of ten feet, the lines shall be laid in separate trenches.
404.14
Sewer Services: A sewer service shall be provided for every existing or proposed lot or building. All sewer services shall be a minimum of four inches in diameter unless otherwise specified. All service lines shall be designed to maintain a minimum of two feet/second sewer velocity. All services shall be shown on the construction and as-built drawings. A common service shall not be allowed for two or more buildings. The service shall extend to five feet inside the property line of the lot being served and normally be within ten feet of the lower corner of the lot. All service laterals shall be a minimum of five feet deep at the property line. Where five feet of cover cannot be achieved, sewer services shall be constructed of ductile iron. A 90 degree bend, constructed from two 45 degree fittings shall be installed at the end of all sewer services with a vertical section of pipe to extend a minimum of four feet above existing ground level (See Standard Details). Connections to the main exceeding eight feet in depth may have the saddle or tee rotated to a bend inserted in the service to provide five feet lateral depth at the property line.
The developer shall be responsible for serving all lots developed. On any lot where the service cannot be found, the developer shall be responsible for payment of the cost of installation of the service. Also, unless noted on the final plat, the service shall be low enough to serve the first-floor elevation at the building line. Install 14-gauge detector wire on all laterals.
The builder shall be responsible for the location of the service prior to the pouring of the foundation, driveway or other appurtenance. The City will not be responsible for any house built too low to be served nor for any service covered by construction.

(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018)
405. - Inspection of Sewers.
405.1
City Inspection: The developer's contractor will be responsible for the quality, accuracy and workmanship of his completed work.
City personnel will visit the job site on a periodic basis and will make spot checks as they deem appropriate. The City of Villa Rica shall have the right to review and inspect all construction and may reject any work that does not meet quality control standards.
405.2
Access to Project: Authorized representatives of the City of Villa Rica, which may include city employees, the city engineer, state or federal agencies, shall have access to the site for inspection at any time.
405.3
Communications During Construction: A preconstruction conference will be required for all projects. The Developer has sole responsibility for scheduling. The Developer, design professional, contractor, and subcontractor(s) are required to meet with the City and all private utilities in this conference. The contractor will notify the city in writing two days before starting construction. The contractor will provide notification by phone any time the work is to be vacated and will provide notice by phone prior to resuming work. The contractor shall request the final inspection.
The city inspector may have informal verbal communications with the contractor foreman or superintendent at any time during construction. The city inspector will not direct the actions of contractor's workmen.
405.4
Concealed Work: The city inspector may direct that the contractor notify the city and receive inspection approval prior to concealing certain work such as manhole foundations, pipe bedding, tees, bends, service laterals, or other appurtenances. At the City's discretion, the City may require work to be uncovered which was not inspected prior to backfilling.
405.5
Minimum Inspection by Developer: The following minimum information shall be determined and certified by the engineer:
1.
Horizontal location. Horizontal location of the line will be checked by measuring "as-built" distances between manholes and bearings from manhole to manhole.
2.
Elevation and slope. Elevation of each invert and top of manhole will be measured and recorded. Actual pipe slope will be computed and any segment having less than minimum allowable slope will be rejected and re-done.
405.6
City Inspection: Cost for all testing shall be paid for by the developer.
1.
Manhole construction. Manholes will be visually inspected to check for plugging of lift holes, use of connecting boots, use of joint material, leakage, proper invert construction, proper setting of frame and cover.
2.
Pipe straightness. Sections of sewer line will be visually checked for straightness. A passing section shall show at least 80 percent of a full circle when observed from one end. Any section which fails this visual test shall be further checked.
The section shall have water run through it sufficient to fill any sags that may exist. Then it shall have a television camera pulled through it to check for sags. Any sag holding more than one and one-half inches of water will require that the pipe be removed and replaced to proper grade after which the section shall be televised again to verify correction. The contractor may propose alternative methods other than televising sewers for the City's approval to determine failing sections of sewers.
3.
Infiltration. The allowable limit for any section from manhole to manhole will be 100 gallons per day per inch of pipe diameter per mile of pipe. If any infiltration is present at the most downstream point, then it will be measured using a specially-made weir and measurements will also be made at each upstream manhole that has any visible flow of water. Any individual segment which exceeds the allowable infiltration shall be corrected to within allowable limits.
4.
Compaction of backfill. Compaction testing may be required for sewers constructed in paved areas or where pavement is planned. A minimum of two tests per 500 feet of trench line located in roadways will be required. If any of these tests show failing results, then the failing backfill will be removed, re-compacted and re-tested, and one additional area will be tested as well.
405.7
Other Testing Requirements: The tests listed below shall be performed by the contractor in the presence of the City. The city will be notified at least two days prior to these tests.
A.
Mandrel Test for PVC Pipe: Procedure for testing PVC sewer pipe for maximum allowable deflection shall be generally as follows (Mandrel sized to 95 percent of the nominal internal pipe diameter):
1.
Completely flush the line making sure the pipe is clean of any mud or trash that would hinder the passage of the mandrel.
2.
During the final flushing of the line, attach a floating block or ball to the end of the mandrel pull rope and float the rope through the line. (A nylon ski rope is recommended).
3.
After the rope is threaded through the line, connect the pull rope to the mandrel and place the mandrel in the entrance of the pipe.
4.
Connect a second rope to the back of the mandrel. This will enable the mandrel to be retrieved if excessive deflection is encountered.
5.
Draw the mandrel through the sewer line.
6.
An increasing resistance to pull is an indication of excessive deflection. If this occurs mark the rope to note the location. Televise the sewer section to identify the extent of the problem and develop a plan, subject to city approval, for correcting the problem. The contractor may propose an alternative method other than televising sewers for the City's approval to determine locations of failing sewers.
7.
Retest.
B.
Air Pressure Test: A low pressure test of each sewer line section will be conducted by the contractor to check for leaks. The following general procedures will apply (also refer to ASTM specs):
1.
Temporarily plug the line segment between two manholes using plugs having air tight fittings through which low pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being tested.
2.
Introduce low pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure reaches 4.5 psig above ground water pressure, if any.
3.
Wait at least five minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while internal air pressure remains no less than 3.5 psig above ground water pressure.
4.
Bleed internal air pressure to exactly 3.5 psig above ground water pressure.
5.
Accurately determine the elapsed time for internal pressure to drop to 2.5 psig above ground water pressure.
6.
The air test is acceptable if elapsed time is no less than shown by the following table:
EXPAND
Pipe Dia. Inches Seconds Per 100 Ft. of Pipe Pipe Dia. Inches Seconds Per 100 Ft. of Pipe
4 11 27 77
6 17 30 85
8 23 36 102
10 28 42 119
12 34 48 136
15 43 54 153
18 51 60 170
21 60 66 187
24 68 72 204
  Air leakage time is based on pipe being damp. If pipe and joints are dry, dampen line if helpful in meeting air test time requirement.
Permanently correct excessive leakage determined by air testing, and repeat operations until City witnesses a successful test on each line segment.
Note: Upon request, the city may allow substitution of exfiltration test in lieu of air pressure test. If used, the exfiltration test will be conducted with a minimum water head of two feet above the groundwater table and the allowable exfiltration will be limited to 100 gallons per day per inch diameter of pipe per mile of pipe.
C.
Manhole Testing: All manholes require testing by either the vacuum test or exfiltration test.
1.
Exfiltration Test: Manholes which have been backfilled around shall be tested for exfiltration. The minimum test time duration is one hour. Manholes shall be filled with water to the top of ring. The maximum allowable exfiltration rate is two gal./ft. of depth/ft. of manhole diameter.
2.
Vacuum Test: Vacuum testing of manholes for water tightness may be used in lieu of the exfiltration test prior to backfilling. After temporarily plugging pipe openings and installing the vacuum base on top of the cone, a vacuum of ten inches of Mercury shall be drawn and the vacuum pump shut off. With valves closed, the pressure shall be monitored for a time period of 60 seconds. At the end of the test period, if the vacuum is nine inches or greater, the manhole has passed the test. If the vacuum drops below nine inches, the manhole has failed.
405.8
Final Inspection and Conditional Acceptance: In no circumstances shall any buildings and plumbing fixtures be connected to the sewers until inspected and approved by the City.
The contractor shall request in writing a final inspection. This final inspection will generally include spot checks of manholes and sewer lines and a complete overview of the project.
After any discrepancies are corrected, the city will issue a letter certifying conditional acceptance of the sewer system. This letter shall commence the start of the 18-month warranty period which is required of the contractor.
On projects having phased development, this letter will allow the developer to apply for a permit for the next phase of development.
At the end of 18 months, the subdivision inspection team will again re-inspect the entire development. When all discrepancies have been corrected, the city will issue an acceptance letter and will begin perpetual maintenance and operation of the sewerage system.
405.9
Maintenance Bond or Letter of Credit: The developer shall post a maintenance bond or Letter of Credit of 25 percent of the total project cost on the facility for an 18-month period after completion and conditional acceptance of the facility by the City of Villa Rica for all projects whose costs exceeds $20,000.00. Bonds are to be written where the City of Villa Rica must release the bond in writing. Bond expiration dates for release are not acceptable.
405.10
Maintenance until Final Acceptance: It shall be the developer's obligation to provide all maintenance for an 18-month period after conditional acceptance of the project by the City of Villa Rica. At the end of the 18-month maintenance period the City shall inspect the sewer system, and upon correction by the developer of all deficiencies noted by the City, the City will accept the sewer system for operation.

600. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT/FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE
Introduction
It is hereby determined that:
The flood hazard areas of the City of Villa Rica are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas.
Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can (1) Protect human life and health; (2) Minimize damage to private property; (3) Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Villa Rica does ordain this ordinance and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.
Floodplain management involves the designation of flood-prone areas and the managing of their uses. It is also aimed at minimizing modifications to streams, reducing flood hazards, and protecting the beneficial uses of the floodplain such as water quality protection. As such, floodplain management can be seen as a subset of the larger consideration of surface water and stormwater management. Floodplain regulations and development restrictions can greatly reduce future flooding impacts, preserve greenspace and habitat, and protect their function in safely conveying floodwaters and protecting water quality. This article aims to help the county integrate floodplain management with stormwater management during the land development process.
The article requires that the county regulate the floodplains that will be expected with future land use conditions, which are based upon the communities adopted future land use map, zoning, or watershed study projections. The ordinance also requires the county to regulate floodplains on all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres and greater.
In order to administer the ordinance, "future-conditions" floodplains must be established.
(1)
Future-conditions floodplains for streams with a drainage area of one square mile (640 acres) and greater in size are to be delineated by the local jurisdiction. As required in the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, District-Wide Watershed Management Plan, cities and counties are expected to model and map at least ten percent of their area each year until future-conditions floodplains have been established for the entire community.
(2)
For streams with drainage area between 100 acres and 640 acres, the local jurisdiction shall model and map the future-conditions floodplains be determined on a per development basis by the applicant.
(3)
For development projects in watersheds of any size where future-conditions floodplains have not yet been established, the applicant will be required to determine the future-conditions floodplain boundaries located on their property in accordance with approved methodologies and in compliance with this article.
(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018; Ord. No. 0-18-2019 , 6-25-2019)

601. - General Provisions.
601.1
Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, stream bank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to:
1.
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
2.
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
3.
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
4.
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
5.
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and,
6.
Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.
601.2
Applicability. This ordinance shall be applicable to all areas within the City of Villa Rica.
Note: Section 605.3 regulates those areas adjacent to the future-conditions floodplain. By definition, these are not areas of special flood hazard. The proposed language remedies this discrepancy.
601.3
Designation of Ordinance Administrator. The city engineer, chief building official or their designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of the ordinance codified in this article.

4.
The repository for public inspection of the FIS, accompanying maps and other supporting data is located with the City of Villa Rica.
601.5
Compatibility with Other Regulations. This ordinance is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, easement, covenant, deed restriction or other provision of law. The requirements of this ordinance are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.
601.6
Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this ordinance shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this ordinance.
601.7
Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the Areas of Special Flood Hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Villa Rica or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made there under.

604. - Standards for Development.
604.1
Definition of Floodplain Boundaries.
1.
Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available.
2.
For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the City of Villa Rica. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the City of Villa Rica, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Villa Rica.
604.2
Definition of Floodway Boundaries.
1.
The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the City of Villa Rica. If floodway data is not available from the City of Villa Rica, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Villa Rica.
a.
Development or subdivisions. If the request involves a development or subdivision, the developer or subdivider shall either pay for the city to conduct the study, or shall pay an independent consultant to provide the data, provided that consultant is first approved by the city engineer. If floodway data is provided by the city, the developer or subdivider shall pay the pro rata share of the costs of the consultant to map the relevant basin.
b.
Individual lots. If the request involves an individual lot not part of a larger common plan of development, or a pre-existing lot in an existing subdivision, then the individual shall consult with the city engineer. The city engineer shall make the determination whether to require additional floodway data at the applicant's expense, to expedite county mapping of the relevant area, or to accept the existing data as sufficient.
604.3
General Standards.
1.
No development shall be allowed within the future-conditions floodplain that could result in any of the following:
a.
Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot;
b.
Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity;
c.
Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or,
d.
Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation.
2.
Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under 1. above shall also meet the following conditions:
a.
Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel;
b.
Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent;
c.
Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased;
d.
Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of Section 604.4;
e.
Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and
f.
Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) or Conditional Letter of Map Amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the City of Villa Rica using the Community Consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
604.4
Engineering Study Requirements for Floodplain Encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of Section 605.4 apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered Professional Engineer in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Villa Rica prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include:
1.
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
2.
Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the City of Villa Rica. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles;
3.
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development;
4.
The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments.
604.5
Floodway Encroachments. Located within Areas of Special Flood Hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
1.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in 2. below.
2.
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and,
3.
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Villa Rica until an affirmative Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the City of Villa Rica.
604.6
Maintenance Requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The City of Villa Rica may direct the property owner (at no cost to the City of Villa Rica) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the City of Villa Rica.

606. - Variance Procedures.
The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the City of Villa Rica or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above.
1.
Requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance shall be submitted to the City of Villa Rica. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the City of Villa Rica. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
2.
Any person adversely affected by any decision of the City of Villa Rica shall have the right to appeal such decision to the Villa Rica City Manager. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
3.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Villa Rica City Manager shall have the right to appeal such decision to the Villa Rica City Council. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
4.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Villa Rica City Council may appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
5.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of Historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a Historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
6.
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this Section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
7.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
8.
In reviewing such requests, the City of Villa Rica shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance.
9.
Conditions for Variances:
a.
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
(i)
a finding of good and sufficient cause;
(ii)
a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and,
(iii)
a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
b.
The provisions of this ordinance are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a Historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
c.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
d.
The City of Villa Rica shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
10.
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the City of Villa Rica shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.
11.
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the City of Villa Rica may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this ordinance.
12.
Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

704. - Minimum Requirements for Erosion and Sedimentation Control Using Best Management Practices.
A.
General Provisions: Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Section 704 of this ordinance. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity.
B.
BMPs: Best Management Practices.
1.
Best management practices as set forth in Section 704 of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
2.
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the City of Villa Rica or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
3.
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the City of Villa Rica or any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
4.
The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
5.
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in C. 15, 16, and 17, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
C.
Minimum Requirements: The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
1.
Stripping of vegetation, re-grading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
2.
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
3.
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
4.
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
5.
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
6.
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
7.
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
8.
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
9.
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.;
10.
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
11.
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
12.
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
13.
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
14.
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Section 704(B) (2.) of this article;
15.
Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
i.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
ii.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbance activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
16.
There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
i.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
ii.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines.
17.
There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction.
i.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and
ii.
The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
iii.
The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
iv.
Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the Division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities.
Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent the City of Villa Rica from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Section 704 (B)(2) and (3) of this article.
18.
In non-trout streams like those in Villa Rica, the State requires a minimum 25-foot vegetated buffer extending from the stream bank or the point of wrested vegetation. However, in the City of Villa Rica these State standards have been extended to require a minimum 50-foot stream buffer with an additional 25-foot setback for any impervious surfaces. (Making it a total of 75 feet)
19.
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit.
(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018; Ord. No. 0-17-2019 , 6-25-2019)

800. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT
Introduction.
It is hereby determined that:
Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;
Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits;
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both State and Federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution;
Therefore, the City of Villa Rica has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff.
(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018)

801. - General Provisions.
801.1
Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This ordinance seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
1.
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
2.
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
3.
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
4.
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
5.
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan;
6.
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and
7.
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.
801.2
