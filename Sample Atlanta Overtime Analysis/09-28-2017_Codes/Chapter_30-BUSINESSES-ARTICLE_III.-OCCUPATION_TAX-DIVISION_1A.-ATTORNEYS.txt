(a)
For all years including and after the calendar year 2004, Division 1A shall apply to the occupation tax imposed on attorneys engaged in the practice of law in the jurisdiction of the city.

As of the effective date of this ordinance, an occupation tax is imposed on the professional classification set forth in section 30-63(a)(1) ("Lawyers") for income earned within the jurisdiction of the city.
(d)
Any attorney who paid an occupation tax for any previous year under the levy imposed by section 30-52, and who is legally entitled to a refund under the terms of O.C.G.A. § 48-5-380, may at his or her option instruct the business tax division to apply that refund to the tax imposed by this Division 1A.

(c)
For the purposes of enforcement of the zoning ordinance, attorneys may be asked by to submit notarized affidavits or other written information concerning the business or profession carried on at a location and the dates of operation when applying for a certificate of occupancy for new construction or renovation. Such affidavits or documents shall be used for the purposes of determining compliance with the zoning ordinance and shall not prevent the practice of the profession of law at any other location which has a valid certificate of occupancy.
(d)
A refusal to submit a notarized affidavit or other written information stating whether a person engages in the practice of law at a particular location or stating the dates of operation at a location shall not be a violation of this article and shall not prevent an attorney from practicing law in the city. The chief financial officer shall document this refusal for use in any later proceeding. Where an attorney fails or refuses to provide information as to the location where they may be served with notices or citations issued in support of the enforcement of this article, the city shall direct the notices or citations to the address listed with the State Bar of Georgia and shall consider the failure or refusal of the attorney to provide current address information to be consent to this method of service.

Sec. 30-95. - Option of the chief financial officer to send bills.
(a)
Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this article, the chief financial officer may choose to send bills to attorneys who list their address with the State Bar of Georgia as being located in the City of Atlanta, including those attorneys who list only post office boxes as their addresses.
(b)
An attorney who prepares and signs a notarized affidavit that they did not practice law within the jurisdiction of the city during some part of the tax year for which the tax bill was generated may have their bill adjusted for the time period stated in the affidavit when such attorney did not maintain an office within the jurisdiction of the city and/or states such other reasons why the occupation tax should be adjusted. Such adjustment shall not be made for those attorneys who elect to pay the $400.00 per practitioner fee as set forth in subsection 30-63(b)(2) unless the affidavit states that the attorney did not practice law in the jurisdiction of the city at any time during the year for which the tax bill was generated. The chief financial officer is authorized to inquire whether such affidavit matches the information maintained by the State Bar of Georgia in connection with the directives of State Bar Rule 1-207 and/or to take such other steps as deemed necessary to determine the accuracy of the affidavit. The submission of an affidavit requesting adjustment shall not act to prevent the imposition of penalties and interest should the chief financial officer deny the request for adjustment.
(c)
The option of the chief financial officer to send bills shall not relieve attorneys from the obligation to pay any tax due for any calendar year including 2004 by April 1 of the following year.
(d)
The chief financial officer may include in any bills, the unpaid tax balance from other years, including all fees and penalties and the amount of interest, which has accrued on any unpaid tax liability. The failure of the chief financial officer to list any unpaid balance on any bill shall not operate to relieve the taxpayer from liability for any balance due.
(e)
It shall be a violation of this section for any attorney to willfully and intentionally misrepresent a material fact in an affidavit to avoid the payment of the occupation tax imposed by this division, or the occupation tax imposed by section 30-52, and the sole enforcement action to be taken is set forth as follows:
(i)
When the chief financial officer has reason to believe that an attorney has willfully and intentionally misrepresented a material fact in any affidavit submitted to business tax division for the purposes of avoiding full payment of the occupation tax, he or she shall consult with the city attorney to determine whether such conduct should be referred to the State Bar of Georgia for investigation as to whether a violation of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct has occurred.

Further proceedings concerning the execution procedure employed in the enforcement of this section shall be as provided by state law. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in other sections of this article, the use of tax executions and the reporting of any alleged mis-representations as set forth in section 30-95 shall be the sole mechanism for enforcement of the occupation tax levy against attorneys.
