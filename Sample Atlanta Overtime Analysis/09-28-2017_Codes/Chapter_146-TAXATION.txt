The Atlanta Urban Enterprise Zone Act (Ga. L, 1998, p. 4493), as amended, is incorporated by reference into the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances.
(Code 1977, § 7-4069(A); Ord. No. 1995-15, §§ 1, 2, 5-8-95; Ord. No. 1995-31, § 1, 6-25-95; Ord. No. 1995-33, §§ 1—5, 9, 6-25-95; Ord. No. 1996-23, §§ 1, 2, 5-28-96; Ord. No. 2005-78, §§ 1, 2, 11-14-05)
Sec. 146-52. - Local eligibility requirements for designations.
Set forth as follows are criteria which shall be used in the course of designating housing, commercial and industrial enterprise zones:
(1)
All enterprise zones.
a.
Proposed enterprise zones shall be consistent with the currently adopted comprehensive development plan of the city prior to the creation of the zone.
b.
Proposed land use within enterprise zones shall comply with the city's zoning ordinance prior to zone creation.
c.
The applicant for an enterprise zone must demonstrate to the city's satisfaction the economic necessity for the enterprise zone designation.
d.
An existing zone may be expanded only if ten percent or more of the perimeter of the proposed addition is contiguous to the perimeter of the existing zone.
e.
All zones shall be designed in such a way as to result in minimum displacement of occupants. All relocation costs associated with displacement as defined by state law resulting directly from the creation of the zone shall be borne by the applicant.
f.
The department of planning, development and neighborhood conservation shall certify that the proposed zone has been subject to disinvestment. Such certification shall be based upon relevant, objective data, such as evidence that the ratio of new housing starts to existing inventory for the most recent five-year period is less for the census tract in which the proposed development would be located than for the city as a whole.
g.
The applicant shall demonstrate that tax abatement is necessary to the financial feasibility of the proposed development by providing evidence that one of the following conditions has been met:
1.
With regard to the development of housing for sale, fewer than 20 percent of the proposed units would be affordable without tax abatement for households whose income does not exceed the low-income level defined in section 146-52(2)b.1, based upon reasonable assumptions as certified by the department of planning, development and neighborhood conservation; or
2.
With regard to the proposed development of income-producing property (including rental housing units, fewer than 20 percent of which would be affordable for low-income households without tax abatement), the proposed development without tax abatement would generate, on a cumulative basis over the first five years, either (a) a negative cash flow, or (b) a fixed-rate debt service coverage ratio of less than 1.20, or (c) a variable-rate debt service coverage ratio equivalent to said fixed-rate ratio, based upon reasonable assumptions as certified by the department of planning, development and neighborhood conservation.
h.
No enterprise zone shall be approved if the applicant owes the city for undisputed water bills which are more than 90 days delinquent or the applicant owns real property not located within the proposed enterprise zone against which city-imposed liens are outstanding and unsatisfied.
(2)
Housing and mixed-use residential/commercial enterprise zones.
a.
Housing and mixed-use residential/commercial enterprise zones shall be used to promote the development of mixed-income neighborhoods.
1.
Twenty percent of the total units to be provided shall reflect the same ratio of housing type and bedroom composition that is proposed throughout the zone, and shall be within the ability to pay of those households whose annual income does not exceed 60 percent of the median family income for the Atlanta metropolitan statistical area as most recently published by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and as adjusted for household size in accordance with HUD procedures. For said units, the property owner shall verify each tenant's household income at the time that said tenant initially executes a lease agreement. Furthermore, the property owner by January 31 of each year shall submit a report to the commissioner of planning, development and neighborhood conservation, indicating the household income of each tenant who executed a lease agreement during the previous calendar year.
2.
Twenty percent of the units for sale shall reflect the same ratio of housing type and bedroom composition that is proposed throughout the zone, and shall bear purchase prices which do not exceed two and one-fifth times the median family income for the Atlanta metropolitan statistical area as most recently published by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
3.
Twenty percent of the units for rent, if any, shall reflect the same ratio of housing type and bedroom composition that is proposed throughout the zone, and shall bear monthly rents which do not exceed 30 percent of the low-income level defined in section 146-52(2)a.1 or, in the case of rental housing units that are being financed through federal low-income housing tax credits, said units shall bear monthly rents which do not exceed the maximum rents prescribed in Section 42, Internal Revenue Service Code, based upon the low-income level defined in section 146-52(2)a.1.
4.
Five percent of all vacant units shall be available to Atlanta police officers and their families, regardless of their household incomes, at purchase prices which do not exceed the affordable level as defined in section 146-52(2)a.2, or at monthly rents which do not exceed the affordable level as defined in section 146-52(2)a.3, consistent with any maximum income restrictions that may apply to said units by virtue of their being financed through any federal, state, or local programs that promote the development of affordable housing. Said units shall count toward meeting the 20 percent affordable housing requirement set forth in section 146-52(2)a.1.
b.
Affordable housing as defined in section 146-51 shall be dispersed throughout the housing enterprise zone as reflected on the approved site plan for each zone.
1.
Industrial enterprise zones shall be limited geographically only by the general provisions of this section and by the requirements of subsection (2)b.1 [(2)a.1] of this section.
c.
In order to qualify for tax abatement, owners of renter-occupied units who rehabilitate or replace their units during the ten-year life of the zone, must agree to first offer the rehabilitated or replaced units for rent to the same occupants or subsequent occupants for the remaining life of the zone at monthly rents which do not exceed 80 percent of the fair market rents for the city as established by the department of planning, development and neighborhood conservation.
d.
The city shall assign preference to project-specific housing enterprise zones. However, in cases where the department of planning, development and neighborhood conservation has determined that a project-specific housing enterprise zone is not feasible, the city may create an areawide housing enterprise zone, provided that 50 percent or more of the land area in the proposed zone shall be committed to specific development projects.
e.
Each applicant shall demonstrate, with verification from two or more lending institutions, that 30 percent or more of the units to be developed in the proposed zone are ready for construction to begin during the first year of the housing enterprise zone designation.
f.
If HUD fails to publish such data for a period of one year or more, the commissioner of planning, development and neighborhood conservation shall publish annually a set of fair market rents for new construction by adjusting the most recently published HUD data in proportion to the residential rent component of the consumer price index as published annually by the United States Department of Labor, and such rents shall apply to new construction in housing enterprise zones for the purposes of this section.

(c)
On the basis of such information, the department of planning, development and neighborhood conservation shall evaluate the application with respect to the requirements of this division and shall prepare a report on the results of said evaluation.
