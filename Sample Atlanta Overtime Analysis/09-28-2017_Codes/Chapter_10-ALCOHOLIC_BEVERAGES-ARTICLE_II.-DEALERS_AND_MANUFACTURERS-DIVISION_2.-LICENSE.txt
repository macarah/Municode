Except as provided in section 10-109.1, in lieu of revocation or the failure to renew, the mayor may impose a fine upon any licensee holding a license to sell alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption, such fine not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation.

After denial, revocation or the failure to renew a license, the mayor, upon the recommendation of the license review board and after a hearing by the board, may refuse to accept or consider any application for a license to operate at the location for the sale of alcoholic beverages for a period of 12 months from the time of denial, revocation or failure to renew such license; however, any new application for licensure at such location shall ask of the new applicant whether the location has been denied, revoked or not renewed under this division. For purposes of this subsection the 12-month period as stated in this subsection shall be tolled during any period of time that an appeal is pending of said refusal to accept or consider any application, or any period of time that by operation of law the city cannot enforce said refusal to accept or consider any application, or any period of time during which there is in place a valid, voluntary agreement between the city and the entity whose application the mayor has refused to accept or consider to not enforce the mayor's decision pending the outcome of litigation in any way involving said refusal to accept or consider any application.
(f)
For due cause, if a violation of this chapter occurs which results in an emergency situation in which continued operation of the premises by the licensee endangers the health, welfare or safety of the public, the mayor or the mayor's designee may suspend any license. Any such suspension may be made effective immediately and shall remain in force until the next regular or called meeting of license review board.
(g)
The mayor may, upon a finding of due cause, deny, revoke, suspend or refuse to renew any license upon a determination that public convenience and advantage would not be promoted by the approval of an applicant's application. In making such a determination the mayor may consider the general welfare and safety of the community, noise, parking and traffic with reasonable consideration being given to the character of the area and its peculiar suitability to the proposed uses and the stability of the neighborhood as they may be impacted by the proposed licensed premises. The decision of the mayor may be appealed via Certiorari to the Superior Court of Fulton County.
(h)
Property owners of licensed premises will be responsible to a reasonable extent for unlawful activity which occurs on their premises on a regular basis such that the property owner knows or should have known that such unlawful activity was taking place on the licensed premises. If' it appears that such activity was encouraged or if it appears that the property owner could have prevented such activity, in addition to being authorized to deny, revoke and refuse to renew the license, the mayor shall be authorized to deny the issuance of any license under this division at that location for a period up to two years from the occurrence of such unlawful activity, and such property shall also lose its permitted and nonconforming uses for the same period. Such a decision by the mayor may be appealed via Certiorari to the Superior Court of Fulton County. At the time an application is submitted, the applicant shall also submit a form, provided by the department of police and signed by the property owner of the proposed licensed premises, which states that the owner has been notified of this section. Property owners will not be responsible for unlawful activity on their property unless they have first been warned in writing by certified or registered mail, at least once, that such activity was occurring on the property. Property owners shall only be responsible for unlawful activity similar to that about which they were warned. However, this section does not require that such owners be notified about every instance of unlawful activity occurring on their property.

The provisions of section 10-109 shall supersede any and all other provisions of the City Code of Ordinances with which there exists a conflict.
