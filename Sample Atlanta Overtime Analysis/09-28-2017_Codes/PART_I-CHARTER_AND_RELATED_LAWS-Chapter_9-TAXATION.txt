A person shall not receive the homestead exemption granted by subsection (a) of this section unless the person or person's agent files an affidavit with the tax commissioner of Fulton County giving the person's age, or if disabled, the certificate or certificates required by subsection (b) of this section, and the amount of income which the person and the person's spouse received during the last taxable year for income tax purposes, and such additional information relative to receiving such exemption as will enable the tax commissioner to make a determination as to whether such owner is entitled to such exemption. The tax commissioner shall provide affidavit forms for this purpose.
(d)
Applications for the homestead exemption provided for by this section shall be processed in the same manner as other applications for homestead exemptions, and the provisions of law applicable to the processing of homestead exemptions, as the same now exist or may hereafter be amended, shall apply thereto. After a person has filed the proper affidavit and certificate or certificates, it shall not be necessary to make application and file the said affidavit and certificate thereafter for any year and the exemption shall continue to be allowed to such person. It shall be the duty of any such person, however, to notify the tax commissioner in the event such person becomes ineligible for any reason to receive the homestead exemption granted by this section.
(e)
The homestead exemption granted by this section shall be cumulative of any other homestead exemption applicable to City of Atlanta or City of Atlanta School District ad valorem taxes. The homestead exemption granted by this section shall apply to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1990.

Sec. 9-61. - Short title.
This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Atlanta Urban Enterprise Zone Act."
(1988 Ga. Laws, page 4164, § 1)
Sec. 9-62. - Findings and purpose.
It is found and declared that economically and socially depressed areas exist within the City of Atlanta and that these areas contribute to or cause unemployment, create an inordinate demand for public services, and, in general, have a deleterious effect on the public health, safety, welfare, and morals. It is further found that these areas are commonly characterized by no investment or underinvestment by private enterprise in ventures which produce housing units, jobs, trade, provision of services, and other economic activities which individually and together contribute to a healthy society. This lack of private investment, economic activity, and housing activity contributes materially to social and economic depression in such areas. Therefore, it is in the public interest that incentives be provided to private enterprise to invest in such areas by developing housing units, creating jobs and trade, providing services, and by other economic activities. It is the purpose of this Act, therefore, to grant special powers of tax abatement to the City of Atlanta to provide such incentives. It is the intention of the General Assembly that this Act be liberally construed to carry out such purpose.
