(3)
To stabilize and improve property values in such buildings, sites and districts;

(1)
Public sidewalks shall be located along all public streets and shall consist of two zones: an amenity zone and a walk zone.
(2)
Amenity zone requirements: The amenity zone shall be located immediately adjacent to the curb. Width shall be measured from back (building side) of curb to the walk zone. Minimum width shall be five feet. This zone is reserved for the placement of street trees and street furniture including utility and light poles, public art, waste receptacles, fire hydrants, traffic signs, traffic control boxes, newspaper boxes, transit shelters and similar elements in a manner that does not obstruct pedestrian access or motorist visibility. Such elements, where installed, shall be of a type specified by the Director in accordance with uniform design standards for placement of such objects in the public right-of-way.
(3)
Walk zone requirements: The walk zone shall be located immediately contiguous to the amenity zone and shall be a continuous hardscape for a minimum width of 10 feet for arterial and collector streets and six feet for all other streets. Said zones shall contain a consistent cross-slope not exceeding two percent. No fixed elements, including pole mounted signage, traffic control boxes or other utility structures, shall be placed above ground in the walk zone for a minimum height of eight feet.
(4)
Paving: All sidewalk paving shall be of a type specified in accordance with uniform design standards for placement of such objects in the public right-of-way. Any existing decorative hardscape treatment of sidewalks, including amenity zone and sidewalk walk zone areas, shall be retained as part of any new development or replaced with materials that match in size, shape, and color.
(5)
Street tree planting requirements: Street trees are required and shall be planted in the ground within the amenity zone and spaced equidistance and on-center between street lights a maximum of 40 feet apart. All newly planted trees shall be single-stemmed at a minimum of three inches in caliper (measured 36 inches above ground), shall be a minimum of 12 feet in height at the time of planting and shall be limbed up to a minimum height of seven feet. Trees shall be planted with a minimum of 40 square feet of evergreen ground cover such as mondo grass or liriope spicata. All tree plantings, replacement and removal shall be approved by the city arborist.
(6)
Pedestrian and street lights shall be placed equidistant and on-center between required street trees within the amenity zone.
(7)
Where property within the district abuts an R district without an intervening street, the sidewalk area within 20 feet of such districts shall taper when necessary to provide a smooth transition to the existing R districts sidewalk. In the event that the abutting R district has no existing sidewalk the sidewalk shall taper to a width of six feet, measured from the street curb, or as approved by the Director of the Office of Zoning and Development.
(8)
Adjustments to the sidewalk requirements may be permitted by the Director of the Office of Zoning and Development upon a finding that one or more of the site conditions set forth in subsections (8)(a) through (8)(f) below are present on the site. The applicant requesting the adjustment must provide documentation establishing the presence of the site condition(s) relied upon. If the adjustment results in the waiver of the sidewalk requirement on the site, the applicant shall construct sidewalks of equal or greater length along adjoining streets in a specific location approved by the director.
a.
Trees exist within the proposed sidewalk zone having a diameter at breast height (DBH) of six inches or more;
b.

(Code 1977, § 16-02.002)
Sec. 16-02.003. - Conditional zoning.
(1)
Each general district established in section 16-02.002 shall have a subclassification thereunder known as "conditional" for that classification.
(2)
All zoning districts as shown on the official zoning map with a suffix "C" after the district designation (i.e. C-1-C) denote that the parcel is zoned "conditional" under previous ordinance amendments by the council. Such conditions shall remain in effect, and copies of such conditional ordinances may be obtained from the clerk of council.
(3)
Except as specifically modified by this section, an application for conditional zoning shall be treated as an amendment and shall be subject to the requirements and procedures of chapter 27.
(4)
Applicant may apply for conditional zoning and shall so state on the application. The conditional zoning application may be based on written conditions contained within the application and the subsequent zoning amendment, or it may be based on a site plan. All applications for conditional zoning shall be accompanied by survey of the property drawn to scale showing the tract boundaries which shall have been prepared by a registered land surveyor or registered professional engineer. Further each conditional zoning application shall specify the use or uses proposed for each structure to be located on the site. All applications for conditional zoning which are supported by a site plan shall in addition to the requirements cited above also contain plans showing the following:
(a)
Location and size of proposed structures including number of stories and total floor area.
(b)
Location and size of parking areas, including loading spaces with proposed ingress/egress, and
(c)
The specific types and dimensions of any walls, fences, planted buffers or visual screens.
(5)
Plans shall be prepared by or under the supervision of a registered architect, landscape architect, or planner holding the designation of member of the American Institute of Certified Planners, competent in the preparation of detailed and accurate plans. Said plans shall be drawn to scale and shall contain the signature, seal and/or state registration number of the professional by whom or under whose supervision said plan was prepared. Said plans shall contain the following certification: "I hereby certify that I am familiar with the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Atlanta, as amended. I further certify that to the best of my knowledge and ability, these plans are accurate and comply with the district and general regulations of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Atlanta." Plans in support of an application for conditional zoning shall be submitted in triplicate.
(6)
The zoning review board, after the required public hearing, may recommend approval of the conditional application as submitted, may recommend denial of the application, or may recommend a change in the conditions, as deemed appropriate.
(7)
After approval of the conditional zoning ordinance by the mayor and council, a request for a building permit shall be submitted to the director, bureau of buildings, who shall make the determination that the final building and site plans are in conformance with the approved site plan and with any conditions attached by the council. An approved site plan shall not be deemed to authorize the violation of any of the terms or requirements of this zoning ordinance. Minor changes in the approved site plan may be authorized by the director, bureau of planning. For the purposes of this chapter, a minor change in the approved site plan means a change to a site plan that was approved by the city council as a condition of a zoning ordinance, provided that the change in layout does not result in the visible intrusion of any building, structure, driveway, walkway, parking lot, plaza, wall, or similar built element into any open space, yard, landscaped buffer, undeveloped space, or any similar space, when any such space is shown on the site plan as being next to and visible from a property line or street. The term "minor change" does not include any increase in the height in feet of any building or structure, any increase in the number of parking spaces, any increase in total square footage of any heated and/or livable space of any buildings and/or structures, or the addition of any buildings or structures, driveways, roads, or parking lots into any open space, yard, landscaped buffer, undeveloped space, or any similar space when any such space is shown on the approved site plan as lying next to and visible from a property line or street.
(8)
If for any reason, development and use of property approved in accordance with the procedure outlined above cannot be accomplished, the plans shall not be altered, changed or varied, except after approval by the council. Applications for amendments to any site plan shall be filed in triplicate with the bureau of planning.
(Code 1977, § 16-02.003; Ord. No. 1999-32, § 1, 3-5-99)
Sec. 16-02.004. - Special public interest district maps; historic and cultural conservation district maps; parking limitation district maps, and pedestrian space plan map.
(1)
Where Special Public Interest (SPI) or Historic and Cultural Conservation (HC) districts have the effect of modifying requirements, regulations and procedures applying in existing districts or districts hereafter created and remaining after SPI or HC districts are superimposed, such districts may either be indicated by overlay designation on the official zoning map or by SPI or HC districts; the district boundaries and designation shall be shown on the official zoning map. The parking limitation district maps and the pedestrian plan maps relate to the SPI districts.
(2)
Flood Hazard District Map, Chattahoochee Corridor Map, and MARTA Corridor Map. Within areas on the flood hazard district map indicated as subject to flood hazards, in addition to the regulations and procedures applying generally, certain special limitations, requirements and procedures shall apply as hereinafter set forth [see chapter 21]. The flood hazard districts may be shown either by overlay designation or on the official zoning map. For regulations and procedures applying to Chattahoochee Corridor and MARTA Corridor, see chapter 23.
(3)
Airport Maps. Within any airport district designated on the official zoning map, in addition to all zoning regulations, special regulations shall apply. See chapter 22. The airport maps are composed of airport district map, DeKalb-Peachtree Airport map, Fulton County Airport map, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport map, and standards and specifications for airports.
(4)

(Code 1977, § 16-02.004; Ord. No. 2004-51, §§ 1, 2, 8-20-04)
Sec. 16-02.005. - Authentication; location for public inspection.
The official zoning map, properly attested, shall be available for public inspection in the office of the Bureau of Planning, and shall be the final authority as to zoning status of lands. Proper attestation shall mean the verification of amendments of the official zoning map made through legislation in the manner required by state law and the procedures and requirements of these regulations. No zoning designation listed on the official zoning map which is not supported by legislative action adopted in the manner required by state law and the procedures and requirements of these regulations shall be considered to have been properly attested.
(Code 1977, § 16-02.005; Ord. No. 2009-15(09-O-0211), § 1, 5-12-09)
Sec. 16-02.006. - Recording amendments to official zoning map.
On the effective date of a properly attested amendment of the official zoning map, the change shall be posted in an appropriate manner and records accompanying the map shall identify the official action by which such amendment was made, the date of such action, and the date of posting. No such amendment shall become effective until such change and entry has been made.
(Code 1977, § 16-02.006; Ord. No. 2009-15(09-O-0211), § 2, 5-12-09)

Sec. 16-02.008. - Replacement of official zoning map.
If the official zoning map becomes damaged, lost or difficult to interpret by reason of the nature or number of changes, the council may by ordinance authorize a new official zoning map which shall supersede the prior map; provided, however, that if there is uncertainty about the zoning status of any area because of the condition of the map or any part thereof, such action shall take the form of an amendment to the zoning ordinance, and shall resolve the uncertainty.
The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other omissions or errors in the prior map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amendment as to zoning status unless the action adopting such map is an amending action. The new official zoning map shall be authenticated and attested as for the original, with wording indicating when and by what instrument the prior document was adopted.
Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost or wholly destroyed, said documents or any remaining significant parts thereof shall be preserved, together with any significant records pertaining to its adoption or amendment, as a guide to prior zoning status of areas.
(Code 1977, § 16-02.008)
Sec. 16-02.009. - Rules for interpretation of boundaries.
Where uncertainties exist as to the boundaries shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall guide interpretations by the administrative official charged with administration and enforcement of these regulations.
(Code 1977, § 16-02.009)
Sec. 16-02.010. - Center lines as boundaries.
Where boundaries appear to follow center lines of streets, alleys, easements, railroads, waterways and the like, they shall be construed as following such center lines.
(Code 1977, § 16-02.010)
Sec. 16-02.011. - Property and other lines as boundaries.
Where boundaries appear to follow street, lot, block, property, or other lines, they shall be construed as following such lines; provided, however, that in the event of closure of a street or alley, the boundary shall be construed as the center line of the preexisting street or alley unless specific amendment is made otherwise.
(Code 1977, § 16-02.011)
Sec. 16-02.012. - Boundaries extending into water.
Where the full course of boundaries extending into bodies of water is not shown, such boundaries shall be construed as continuing in a straight line to the intersection with another zoning boundary or to jurisdictional limits if no such intersection with another zoning boundary occurs first.
(Code 1977, § 16-02.012)
Sec. 16-02.013. - Boundaries other than as above.
Boundaries which appear parallel or perpendicular to, or as connecting or extensions of, center lines, property lines or other features shown shall be so construed unless there are specific indications to the contrary.
(Code 1977, § 16-02.013)
Sec. 16-02.014. - Dimensions.
Where dimensions are not otherwise indicated on the map, the scale of the map shall govern.
(Code 1977, § 16-02.014)
Sec. 16-02.015. - Where district designation is not indicated for an area.
Where a district designation is not indicated for an area of the official zoning map, it shall be construed to be zoned R-1. Upon discovery of such omission, unless research reveals the correct official zoning status of the land (in which case map corrections and entries relating thereto may be made without legislative action), a corrective amendment shall be initiated by the bureau of planning.
(Code 1977, § 16-02.015)
Sec. 16-02.016. - Boundary changes with changes in jurisdictional boundaries.
Where territory is removed from the jurisdictional limits of the city, zoning boundaries shall be construed as moving with the jurisdictional limits. Where territory is added to the city, unless zoning amendment is concurrent with such annexation, district designation shall be construed as provided in the case of omission of indication (section 16-02.015); and the bureau of planning shall initiate an amendment within 90 days of such annexation.
(Code 1977, § 16-02.016)
Sec. 16-02.017. - Bureau of planning action in cases of uncertainty; extension of regulations in the case of split lots.
Where natural or man-made features existing are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances not covered above, upon request from the director, bureau of buildings, or from any affected property owner, or on its own initiative upon determination that such inconsistencies exist, the bureau of planning shall make a finding and interpretation concerning the boundaries involved in accord with the intent and purpose of this part.
In cases where such findings and interpretation involves only correction to the zoning map and does not change the zoning of property, such corrections shall be made by or at the direction of the bureau of planning without further action, other than appropriate entries as to the nature of the change and the date made.
In cases where the zoning district boundary divides a lot of record at the time the boundary was established, the bureau of planning, upon application by the owner of the property or his duly authorized agent, shall make findings and prepare recommendations as to this boundary line. If the bureau finds and recommends that, in view of the circumstances or the property involved and its relation to adjoining properties, the extension of the district boundary not to exceed 100 feet would not create substantial adverse effects on adjoining property, this boundary line may be revised. The bureau of planning shall so advise the mayor, as chief executive officer of the city, or his designee, and upon approval by the mayor or such official, this district boundary line shall be revised.
Where boundaries divide a lot of record at the time the boundary was established and the owner proposes an extension of the zoning district boundary for either portion of the lot more than 100 feet into the remaining portion, or where the bureau of planning does not find and recommend, or the mayor or his designee does not approve the zoning district boundary extension as provided above, the owner of the lot or his duly authorized agent may petition for a zoning amendment.
(Code 1977, § 16-02.017)

Sec. 15-07.006. - Acknowledgement of lots of record existing prior to the sub-division ordinance.
(a)
Eligible Lots. The director shall acknowledge lots with a legal description filed with Clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County or DeKalb County prior to November 19, 1958, the effective date of the City of Atlanta Subdivision Ordinance, and which do not appear on the official cadastral map on which the bureau of planning has recorded the boundaries of lots recognized by the City of Atlanta provided that all of the following criteria can be satisfied:
1.
No portion of the property in any of the lots to be acknowledged shall have been included in any plat recorded with any other boundaries or dimensions in a manner that shows the intent to abandon the original property lines. Even if the lots on the subject property are currently in their original configuration, any past combination of any portion of the subject properties with another property in a manner that does not evidence intent to maintain the lots in their original configuration shall be considered an abandonment of the original property lines.
2.
Where a single deed includes multiple lots, only a separate metes and bounds description of each individual lot shall be a sufficient description of the original property lines. A legal description in a single deed which identifies multiple lots by reference to lot numbers on a subdivision plat shall not be considered to be a sufficient identification of individual boundaries to justify creation of lots of record unless the metes and bound descriptions of each of the individual lots are also set forth in that deed. A single deed referring to multiple lots on a subdivision plat created under the city's subdivision ordinance and approved and on file with the bureau of planning shall not be required to have a metes and bounds description in the deed so long as the subdivision plat contains a metes and bounds description of the lots and no principal structure, including decks, and porches and other attachments that would ordinarily be included in the building footprint, was constructed over any of the property lines of any lot to be acknowledged.
3.
No primary structure, including decks, and porches and other attachments that would ordinarily be included in the building footprint, shall have been constructed over any of the property lines of the lot to be acknowledged, regardless of whether such primary structure or the attachment thereto, has been or will be demolished. Any document or site plan submitted to the city at any time which shows that a building permit for the primary structure or an addition thereto was requested and granted shall be considered proof that such structure was constructed in that configuration even if the structure no longer exists.
4.
The person requesting the acknowledgment of the lot can produce a full and unbroken abstract of title for the exact legal description to be acknowledged which meets the current Title Standards of the State Bar of Georgia and which is attested to by an attorney licensed by the State of Georgia. The abstract of title must show to the satisfaction of the director that the lots to be acknowledged meet the requirements of this section.
5.
The acknowledgment of the lot does not conflict with other section of the City Code with respect to the creation of new lots of record.
6.
The application procedure is successfully completed.
(b)
Legal Effect. Lots approved as lots of record under this section shall be considered legally non-conforming lots of record and shall be recorded on the official cadastral map of the City of Atlanta.
(c)
Setback Requirements. Acknowledgement of lots of record under the process provided in this section shall not excuse an applicant for a building permit from any setback requirements for the zoning district where the lot is located.
(d)
Other Procedures Available. Applications that do not meet the criteria for acknowledgement of lots of record may still be eligible for subdivision of the property so long as the proposed subdivision meets all other requirements of the City Code.
(e)
Procedure for Application. Applicants requesting acknowledgement of historically platted lots of record shall comply with the following procedure:
1.
File a request for acknowledgement on the application form made available by the director. An application shall be accepted when offered to the bureau of planning and the director may designate one or more persons to accept applications. The address on the application is the location where the applicant agrees that all notices and other written communication shall be received.
2.
Each owner of record must show their consent to the procedure as evidenced by the submission of a notarized consent form in substantially the form and containing the same information as that form made available by the director. Consent forms from all owners of record must be submitted as a part of the application package before an application will be accepted.
3.
Submit a certified copy of the recorded plat currently on file in Fulton and/or DeKalb County. The plat must clearly outline the boundary dimensions of the subject lot and must be legible.
4.
Submit a full and unbroken abstract of title for the exact legal description to be acknowledged which meets the current Title Standards of the State Bar of Georgia and which is attested to by an attorney licensed by the State of Georgia.
(i)
The abstract of title must document that each lot to be recreated is eligible under the criteria set forth in this section.
(ii)
The abstract of title must document the transfer of the original lots since the recording of the original plat and document that no transaction has involved the abandonment of property lines through the combination or recombination of any portion of the original lots on the subject property with each other or with other adjacent properties.
5.
Submit three copies of a recordable plat or survey showing existing and proposed property boundaries and all other applicable information specified in section 15-07.004.
(i)
The plat or survey must be clear and legible and shall not exceed 17"x 22".
(ii)
The plat or survey must show the proposed property boundaries as a solid line.
(iii)

(iii)
If the applicant requests deferral of NPU consideration and so informs the director, the NPU consideration at the agreed upon meeting date shall be considered timely and the director may reschedule consideration of the application. If the NPU defers on the consideration of the application, this shall be considered waiver of the opportunity for review.
(iv)
The NPU shall be responsible for making its recommendations available to the director for consideration by the staff.
4.
Failure of the director to accomplish the tasks required for the required notifications shall not entitle an applicant to approval of the application but the applicant shall have the right to have their application reviewed by the bureau of planning within 180 days of the date that a complete application is received.
(g)
Citizen Input. During the lot of record staff review meeting provided in this section, citizens may present information to the director refuting the validity of the deeds or other documentation submitted by the applicant showing the transfer of the original lots since the recording of the original deeds.

Sec. 15-08.005. - Lots.
(a)
All proposed subdivisions shall be laid out and designed in an orderly pattern of development so as to provide for developable lots on both sides of all new streets and uniform building setbacks for all lots which radiate from the end of cul-de-sac street. No subdivision shall be approved in which lots are created on only one side of a new street. No subdivision shall be approved in which there is a reserved strip of land along any portion of any street proposed to be created, regardless of the form of ownership which may be proposed for the reserved strip of land, except in the case of a parcel acquired by the applicant to provide access to an interior subdivision. In that event the access parcel shall be wide enough to contain the required street right-of-way and in addition shall have a width equal to the width required to provide the minimum corner lot side setback from the proposed street to each existing house on the contiguous lots. The applicant may offer that portion of the side buffer strips to the contiguous homeowners as necessary to create a conforming corner lot, or, in the alternative may provide that a homeowners association maintain and operate the side buffer strips on either side of the entrance parcel. Side buffer strips shall not be included in calculations for required lot area. The director may waive the requirement set forth in this section that new streets shall have lots on both sides of said new street in cases where the subject site abuts a lake, or a public park or other permanent open space having a depth which is no less than 50 percent of the average depth of the lots in the proposed subdivision.
(b)
Each proposed subdivision plat shall indicate the buildable area of each proposed lot. In any case where yard requirements specified in parts 15 and 16 of this Code differ, the more restrictive requirement shall apply.
(c)
Except for lots created for use as an amenity area, each lot to be created shall have a developable area for a residence and for accessory uses that meets the requirements of this part and of part 16 of this Code. Lots created for use as an amenity area shall be reviewed by the director of the Office of Zoning and Development to ensure that the amenity area is sufficiently buffered from and will not negatively impact surrounding properties, is of a size and shape to safely and adequately accomplish its proposed use, and is in an appropriate location that is accessible to the subdivision's residents. Lots which contain floodplains, wetlands, areas of severe slope, or other restrictive easements shall be reviewed by said director to ensure that the developable area is of the size and shape required by this part to permit the intended residential use. The minimum developable area for a dwelling shall be one continuous area containing a minimum square footage for a dwelling as follows, and minimum square footage to allow space for accessory uses, and a total developable area as follows:

(1)
Lots on cul-de-sac streets shall have side lot lines which are within 10 degrees of radial to the center of the ball of the cul-de-sac, shall have no less than 35 feet of frontage on the ball of the cul-de-sac, and shall have the required amount of frontage as is specified within the applicable zoning district regulation at the required front yard building setback line for that lot.
(2)
Corner lots are required to provide a half-depth front yard setback along the side street side. Corner lots shall have a street frontage which is 10 percent greater than the amount otherwise required by the applicable zoning district regulation.
(3)
Side lot lines on curved streets shall be within 10 degrees of radial to the curved street line, shall have no less than 35 feet of frontage at the street, and shall have the required amount of frontage as is specified within the applicable zoning district regulation at the required front yard setback line for that lot.
(4)
All lots, other than lots on the ball of cul-de-sac, corner lots, and lots on curved streets, which are described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) above, shall have the amount of lot frontage required by the applicable zoning district regulation. All such lots shall have side lot lines ranging between 80 and 100 degrees except where the existing side lot lines are approximately parallel to each other and intersect the adjacent street at an angle of not less than 60 degrees, and the proposed side lot lines replicate the existing side lot line pattern.
(5)
Double-frontage lots shall be prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries. Where such double-frontage lots are permitted, there shall be provided an undisturbed buffer zone of at least 20 feet along the major traffic artery over which there shall be no right of vehicular access.
(6)
In all historic neighborhoods, in which lot layout, patterns, and design are a part of and are directly related to identified elements of that neighborhood's character, all new lots shall conform to existing lot layout, patterns, and design, including, without limitation, orientation of lots to public streets.
(e)
Land subject to flooding and land that is topographically unsuitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy nor for other uses when to do so will create or increase danger to health, life, or property or aggravate erosion or flood hazard. Such land within the subdivision shall be set aside for such uses as shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
(f)
Dedication of Land in Floodplains, Wetland Areas, Stream and Creek Beds and Areas of Severe Slope. Any land which is located within the limits of the 100-year floodplain, within a wetland area, adjacent to a stream or creek bed, or has a slope in excess of 60 degrees may, at the option of the applicant, either be designated on the subdivision plat as an area which will remain in perpetuity as an undisturbed area or may be deeded in fee or easement to the City of Atlanta or other government or to a private not-for-profit corporation authorized to receive land grants and approved by the governing authority, or may alternatively choose neither of the options described above.
(g)
Land Previously Used for Landfill.
(1)
In any application for subdivision where the site has previously been used, in whole or in part, as a landfill, no such application shall be given final approval until all of the data described in (2) below has been submitted and the commissioner of the department of public works has made a finding, based on all said data provided pursuant to two (2) below, that the subject site is safe for development.
(2)
The applicant shall submit geotechnical data, including a description of subsurface conditions, describing the character of any materials under the proposed subdivision site that may adversely affect the stability or settlement of proposed buildings or structures, and the presence of any soil contaminant which may adversely affect the use of proposed buildings or structures and the health and safety of future occupants of the subject site. Said geotechnical data shall be certified by a registered professional engineer and shall contain the following information:
a.
Boring logs at a frequency determined by the commissioner of the department of public works, including soils laboratory data from a recognized testing laboratory; and
b.
Analysis of the soil composition with specific analysis to determine the presence of methane or similar hazardous gases; and

Where the end of a parking space abuts a landscaped area, barrier curbs may be placed in the parking space at a maximum of two feet from the end of the parking space. This two-foot-wide area may have the pavement removed, and be developed as part of the required landscaped area.
(4)
Surface parking lots shall have a minimum landscaped area equal to at least ten percent of the paved area within said lot. In no case shall a parking lot owner be required to provide landscaped areas that exceed ten percent of the paved area.
(5)
A minimum of one tree per eight parking spaces shall be included in the required landscaped areas. For the purposes of satisfying this requirement, existing trees that are two and one-half inches or more in caliper as measured at a height 36 inches above ground level, shall be considered to be equivalent to one or more newly planted trees on the basis of one tree for each two and one-half inches in caliper.
(6)
In addition to trees, ground cover shall be provided in order to protect tree roots and to prevent erosion. Ground cover shall consist of shrubs, ivy, liriope, pine bark mulch, and other similar landscaping materials.
(7)
Shrubs shall be maintained at a maximum height of two and one-half feet, except where such shrubs are screening the parking surface from an adjacent residential use.

In the event that landscaped areas are in the interior of a parking lot they shall be a minimum of six feet in width and six feet in length with a minimum area of 36 square feet.
(9)
Continuous landscaped buffer strips shall be constructed along sidewalks and public rights-of-way where surface parking lots are adjacent to such sidewalks or public rights-of-way, except at points of ingress and egress into the facility. Such landscaped buffer strips shall be a minimum of five feet in width and shall contain, in addition to ground cover, trees planted a maximum of 42.5 feet on center along the entire length.
(10)
Newly planted trees shall be a minimum of two and one-half inches in caliper as measured at a height six inches above ground level; shall be a minimum of ten feet in height; shall have a 40-foot minimum mature height and shall be drought-tolerant. Trees shall be planted a minimum of 30 inches from any barrier curb, so as to prevent injury to trees from vehicle bumpers.
(11)
Where landscaped areas are located adjacent to vehicle overhangs, the trees shall be planted in line with the side stripes between parking spaces in order to avoid injury to trees by vehicle bumpers.
(12)
All landscaped areas, including trees located in the public right-of-way that are counted in the fulfillment of this requirement, shall be properly maintained in accordance with approved landscape plans. In the event that a tree or any plant material dies, it shall be replaced within six months so as to meet all requirements of this section and to allow for planting in the appropriate planting season.
(13)
Notwithstanding subsection (4) above, existing parking lots shall not be required to reduce the number of parking spaces by more than three percent (3%) as a result of implementing these landscaping regulations.
(14)
If it is determined by the bureau of planning that implementation of these regulations will result in the loss of parking spaces in existing lots, the director, bureau of traffic and transportation may increase the percentage of allowable compact car spaces from 25 percent up to 35 percent so as to minimize the loss of parking spaces.
(15)
Administrative variances may be granted by the director, bureau of planning only upon making all of the following findings:
(a)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, topography, subsurface conditions, overhead structures or the existence of sufficient trees in the public right-of-way within ten feet of the property line;
(b)
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
(c)
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Atlanta.
(16)
Owners, lessees, or authorized agents of existing parking lots shall be required to submit a landscaping plan within 12 months of the effective date of this section, which illustrates the proposed application of these landscaping regulations. Within six months of the receipt of said landscaping plans, the bureau of planning shall approve these landscaping plans or develop alternative plans which meet the requirements. Within 24 months of the effective date of this section, all required landscaping shall be implemented.

Sec. 8-2096. - Duties and responsibilities.
(a)
The owner of a structure shall be responsible for maintaining the minimum standards required by this article unless his lease with the operator provides otherwise. In any event, the operator shall be responsible:
(1)
For keeping all parts of the premises under the control of the operator in a clean and safe condition and the operator shall refrain from performing any acts which would render other parts of the premises unclean, insanitary, or unsafe or which would obstruct the owner from performing any duty required by this article;
(2)
For the elimination of infestation in or on the premises subject to his control;
(3)
For maintaining all plumbing fixtures used by the operator in a clean, sanitary, and operable condition and he shall not deposit any material in any fixture or sewer system which would result in stoppage of or damage to the fixture or sewer system; and
(4)
For not permitting ceiling or wall fixtures to be used for supplying power to equipment other than that for which they are designed or allowing the use of loose cords or extension lines in excess of six (6) feet.
(b)

(Code 1977, § 8-2096)
Sec. 8-2097. - Legal effect.
It is not the purpose or intention of this article that any law be held to be in conflict with it and hereby repealed; rather, it is the intention of this article to be given the legal effect set forth in section 8-2082.
(Code 1977, § 8-2097)
Sec. 8-2098. - Vacant buildings; nuisances.
(a)
It is hereby found that there are buildings and other structures and parts of compartmentalized buildings and structures in the city of all zoning classifications which are vacant. By reason of their continued vacancy, these buildings and other structures are subjected to vandalism primarily brought about by reason of removing various parts of the structure. Removal of parts of the structure creates a condition whereby such buildings and other structures are subject to an unauthorized entry. It is further found that when such buildings and other structures are subject to an unauthorized entry, they become a breeding ground for victimless criminal activity, such as, but not limited to, intemperate use of alcoholic beverages and use of drugs, thus leading to incidences of destruction of such buildings and other structures by fire and also creating health and sanitation hazards. Additionally, it is found that other criminal activity, such as, but not limited to, murder and rape, are likewise carried on in such buildings and other structures. Such an unauthorized entry allows various classes of criminal conduct to be carried on in such clandestine surroundings. It is further found that such activity occurs in buildings and structures that may not, within the meaning of applicable portions of Georgia laws and of the Atlanta Housing Code, be subject to demolition and other proceedings.
(b)
Therefore, and in furtherance of the legislative findings hereinabove set forth, it is hereby declared by the council that such buildings and other structures, upon a proper adjudication of such as a nuisance as hereinafter provided, are a nuisance and, under the police power of the city, subject to appropriate abatement proceedings. Further, it is hereby declared by the council that such buildings and other structures are nuisances not only with respect to the safety of the inhabitants of the city, but also with respect to the health, sanitation and welfare of the inhabitants of the city.
(Code 1977, § 8-2098)
Sec. 8-2099. - Vacancy defined.
(a)
Any person who owns a building or structure in the City of Atlanta which, by its continued vacancy, is subject to an unauthorized entry by other persons and has sheltered non-owners or non-tenants, shall be subject to the nuisance abatement procedures hereinafter set forth in this article.
(b)
Vacancy, as used in this section, shall be rebuttably presumed to occur in any structure or building when such structure or building has no visible signs of human habitation, as opposed to occasional human use by non-owners and/or non-tenants, for a period of 15 continuous calendar days; and where such structure or building is in a dilapidated condition, including but not limited to, broken window panes, broken doors, unsecured doors and any other physical condition that might make an unauthorized entry possible without force. This definition of vacancy shall not preclude any judge from finding that any such building or structure is vacant under any other legally acceptable concept of vacancy.

The enforcement officer may, either upon his/her own authority or upon a complaint of one or more residents of the City of Atlanta, cause an inspection of any building or structure in the City of Atlanta to be conducted. This section shall not be construed to require both an enforcement officer acting on his/her own authority and receiving a resident complaint to cause said inspection. If, in the event the mayor or his appointed designee should find that a condition or conditions exist which would bring such building or structure within the definition of a nuisance as set forth in section 8-2099 above, he shall cause a notice by certified mail to be sent to the owner of record of property. Said notice shall enumerate the conditions which, in the opinion of the mayor or his designee, cause the building or structure to constitute a nuisance; shall enumerate the actions which such person should take in order to abate the nuisance; and shall advise such person that any subsequent entry by non-owner or non-tenant shall subject him to the City of Atlanta's Nuisance Abatement Ordinance. In the event that there is a subsequent unauthorized entry, the owner shall again be notified by certified mail of the entry and of the action which should be taken in order to abate the nuisance. In the event that the person so notified for the second time shall have failed to take the necessary steps which, in the opinion of the mayor or his designee, constitutes the abatement of the ordinance within 14 days of the date of the second notice, he or his designee shall be authorized to take the following action to abate said nuisance:
(1)
Cause a citation to issue to any resident owner of any property, requiring the owner of the property to appear in the Municipal Court of the City of Atlanta on a day certain to answer the charges of maintaining a nuisance;
(2)
Cause the City Attorney of the City of Atlanta to proceed in any appropriate Superior Court of the State of Georgia having the proper venue to try and determine the cause, in the event the owner is a non-resident of the City of Atlanta but a resident of the State of Georgia; or
(3)
Cause the city attorney to institute the proper proceeding in any appropriate court of the State of Georgia against a non-resident of the State of Georgia in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of Georgia governing personal jurisdiction over non-residents of the state.

In the event that the trial judge finds that the owner of any such building or structure in the City of Atlanta is maintaining a nuisance as set forth in section 8-2098 hereof, he shall, in accordance with the provisions of section 72-401, Ga. Code Ann., be authorized to make a finding that such building or structure does constitute a nuisance, and, if such is found to exist, he shall order its abatement. The power to order the abatement of such nuisance shall include the power to frame any such order that the ends of justice require and shall include the power to order the owner to repair the building or structure to the extent entry could only be obtained through a forcible unauthorized entry, or to order the demolition of any such building or structure.
(b)
Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the trial judge from granting an appropriate amount of time, as adduced from evidence presented, in which to allow the owner to abate a judicially determined nuisance.
(c)
Nothing herein shall be construed so as to place a limitation upon the power of any superior court judge when proceedings are instituted pursuant to section 8-2100(b) above.

(Code 1977, § 8-2100.2)
Sec. 8-2100.3. - Cost to city; lien on property.
The amount of the cost of having the nuisance abated by the city, either by contract with a third party or by employees of the city, shall constitute a lien upon the building or structure, and the property upon which it stands, for which execution may issue as for property taxes in accordance with any present or future law of the State of Georgia and ordinances of the City of Atlanta, governing tax enforcement and collection.
(Code 1977, § 8-2100.3)
Sec. 8-2100.4. - Relation to other ordinances.
Nothing contained in any of the above six sections shall be construed so as to constitute a repeal of any existing law of the city; but rather, this article shall be construed in pari materia with all other ordinances of the city dealing with the conditions of buildings and other structures located within the City of Atlanta.

Cross reference— Housing code text, app. E.
Sec. 8-2182. - Barrier-free requirements.
(a)
Statement of Intent. The provisions of this section are specifically enacted to further the policy of the city to provide that new single-family, duplexes and triplexes which are constructed with public funds, as herein described, be provided with design features to provide accessibility and usability for physically disabled people. The purpose of this section is to specifically promulgate certain standards which may be less restrictive than ANSI A117.1 while economically providing solutions to accessibility.
(b)
Applicability. The following regulations shall be applicable to new single-family dwellings, duplexes, and triplexes which receive city assistance. For purposes of this section, "city assistance" shall mean funding or assistance from the city or any agency thereof, through any of the following means: (i) receipt of a building contract or similar contractual agreement involving any city-funded program or fund, including but not limited to the Urban Residential Finance Authority (URFA), the Housing Trust Fund, or similar programs; (ii) real estate purchased, leased or donated from the city or any agency thereof; (iii) receipt of preferential tax treatment, bond assistance, mortgage assistance, or similar financial advantages derived from the city or any agency thereof; (iv) dispersal under city auspices of any federal or state construction funds as CDBG; or (v) receipt of any other funding or financial benefit from the city or any agency thereof.
(c)
Design Requirements. The following design requirements shall apply:
Requirement 1. Building entrances. Applicable dwelling units shall be designed and constructed to have at least one building entrance on an accessible route served by a ramp complying with ANSI A117.1-1986, section 4.8, having a maximum slope not to exceed twelve (1:12), unless it is impractical to do so because of terrain or unusual characteristics of the site. Such building entrance doors shall comply with ANSI A117.1, 4.13, and shall have a minimum clear opening of 32 inches.
Any entrance at the front, side or back of the dwelling is acceptable as long as it is served by an accessible route such as a garage or sidewalk.
Requirement 2. Interior door criteria. All dwelling units, whether or not on an accessible route, shall be designed in such a manner that all the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises are sufficiently wide to allow passage by persons in wheelchairs. Lever hardware is required.
Doors, except those serving closets less than 15 square feet in area, within individual dwelling units intended for user passage must provide minimum 32″ clear opening. A 2′-10″ door or standard 6′-0″ sliding patio door assembly is deemed sufficient to comply with this requirement; provided however, compliance with ANSI section 4.13.6 (Maneuvering Clearance at Doors) shall not be mandatory.
Requirement 3. Accessible routes into and through the dwelling unit. An accessible route shall be designed and constructed in such a manner that a 36″ wide level route, except at doors, must be provided through the main floor of the unit with ramped or beveled changes at door thresholds.
Requirement 4. Wall reinforcement in bathrooms. Reinforcement in the walls shall be provided at designated locations as specified by ANSI A 117.1, section 4.24, section 4.32, figure 48 and figure 49 so that grab bars may be installed, if needed, at a later date without the necessity of removing portions of the existing wall.
Requirement 5. Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other environmental controls. All applicable dwelling units shall be designed and constructed in such a manner that all premises contain light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other controls in accessible locations.
Controls shall meet the requirements of ANSI A117.1, section 4.25. Where multiple controls serve the same elements (e.g., two remote switches for a light) only one need be accessible.
(d)
Contracts. The provisions of this section shall be incorporated in all city contracts.
(e)
Waiver of Exterior Disability Accessibility Regulations. The requirements of subsection (c), requirement 1 (Building Entrances) herein may be waived by the commissioner of housing, through the issuance of an "Exterior Disability Accessibility Waiver" ("waiver").
A person requesting said waiver shall file an application for disability accessibility waiver with the commissioner, including all documents necessary to prove the existence of the exemption standard herein. The application shall demonstrate that topographical conditions on the site render it impossible to comply with the provisions of subsection (c).
If the application so demonstrates, the commissioner shall issue an exterior disability accessibility waiver to the applicant, in writing, within ten days of receipt of a completed application, which shall become an official component of any issued contract. The commissioner shall retain a copy of said waiver in the department's official records, and shall also forward a copy of said waiver to the director, bureau of buildings at the time of issuance.

To increase the affordability of single-family residential dwellings in close-in neighborhoods by permitting such dwellings on small lots with reduced setback requirements thus decreasing land development costs.
(4)
To provide additional opportunities for affordable in-fill single-family residential development without permitting the down-zoning of existing single-family zoned areas and thereby preserving existing neighborhoods as contemplated in the adopted comprehensive development plan.
(5)

Thereafter, all terms of office shall be for four years, including the appointed board members who serve at the pleasure of the city governing body.
(b)
The initial board members to be elected as provided above shall be elected in a caucus of electors which shall be held within 60 days after the adoption of the resolutions and obtaining the written consents herein provided at such time and place within the district as the governing body of the municipality shall designate after notice thereof shall have been given to said electors by publishing same in the legal organ of Fulton or DeKalb counties, or both, as hereinafter provided.

If a vacancy occurs in an elected position on the board, the board shall, within 60 days thereof, call a special election to fill the same to be held within 60 days of the call unless such vacancy occurs within 180 days of the next regularly scheduled election, in which case a special election may, but need not, be called.

The board may levy taxes, fees, and assessments within the district only on real property used nonresidentially, specifically excluding all property exempt from ad valorem taxation under the Constitution or laws of the State of Georgia and all property used for residential, agricultural, or forestry purposes and specifically excluding tangible personal property and intangible property. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed 2.5 percent of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing governmental services and facilities which are specially required by the degree of density of development within the district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities which are provided to the City of Atlanta as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by Fulton County or DeKalb County, or both, in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by Fulton County, DeKalb County, or the City of Atlanta, respectively. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Fulton County, DeKalb County, or City of Atlanta ad valorem taxes, respectively, and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied, less a fee to cover the costs of collection of one percent thereof, but not more than $25,000.00 in any one calendar year, shall be transmitted by Fulton County or DeKalb County, or both, to the board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized hereby.
(b)
The board shall levy the above-provided taxes between January 1 and June 1 each calendar year and notify in writing the collecting governing body or bodies by June 15 each year so they may include the levy on their regular ad valorem tax bills.
(c)
If, but for this provision, a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable, it shall continue to bear its tax millage then extant upon such event, for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding, until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded.
(d)
In accordance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 36-71-7, each property paying taxes, fees, or assessments levied by the board for any public facility as set forth in section 3-37 of this article, shall receive a credit equal to the present value of all such taxes, fees, and assessments toward any impact fee as may be levied by the City of Atlanta against said property for system improvements, as defined under O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 71 (O.C.G.A. § 36-71-1 et seq.), known as the "Georgia Development Impact Fee Act," which are in the same category as said public facility.

Sec. 3-44. - Cooperation with local governments.
The services and facilities provided pursuant hereto shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board and the governing body of the City of Atlanta. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of the City of Atlanta to provide services or facilities within the district; and the City of Atlanta shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of its facilities located within its respective areas of any district. Said control shall include, but not be limited to, the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the municipality.

(h)

(i)
The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed herein whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of a board, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district, or in notices or proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of a district.

(c)
Issuance by a board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue.

For the purpose of raising revenue for the payment of interest and principal on the bonded indebtedness of the city, the governing body shall have full power and authority to provide by ordinance for the assessment, levy, and collection of an annual ad valorem tax on all real and personal property, which, under the laws of this state, is subject to taxation within the corporate limits of the city, and to provide such an amount in millage as may be necessary to meet and pay all such obligations.
(b)
For the purpose of raising revenue for permanent improvements in the parks of the city, and for facility maintenance, repair, replenishment, enhancement, and the purchase of equipment for such parks, the governing body shall have full power and authority to provide by ordinance for the assessment, levy, and collection of an ad valorem tax on all real and personal property, which, under the laws of this state, is subject to taxation within the corporate limits of the city, in the amount of one-half mill on each dollar of assessed valuation thereon; such tax, when collected shall be used as follows: 90 percent exclusively for permanent improvements to the zoo, golf courses, recreational, and other park facilities of the city, and ten percent for park facility maintenance, repair, replenishment, enhancement, and the purchase of equipment. In the event that any part of the tax so collected cannot be used in any one year, it may be invested in short-term securities until such time as the use of said funds becomes necessary or possible. The tax provided for herein shall be in addition to all other taxes authorized by this Charter.
(c)
The tax authorized by subsection (b) shall be used only as provided herein. Any sums not used in any one year for such purposes shall be converted into a trust fund to be held and expended for such purposes in future years. Half of the half-mill tax may, at the discretion of the council, be used for the purpose of constructing a stadium and related facilities in the city or for the purpose of paying in whole or in part the obligation assumed by the city by contract now or hereafter entered into with any authority now in existence or hereafter created which has agreed to construct a stadium and related facilities in the city.
(d)
No enumeration of any right, power, or authority provided in this Charter shall be construed as limiting or abolishing any right, power, or privilege herein set forth.

The amount so assessed shall be a lien on the lot from the date of the assessment. The governing body shall be authorized to prescribe what should constitute a lot for sanitary purposes and assessment; provided, however, that assessment shall be made on vacant lots as follows: A front footage fee may be assessed in accordance with the zoned property category, residential, apartment, or commercial and no unit fee shall be assessed. Resident lots shall not be subdivided or assessed separately except where they have two or more houses used or intended for use as separate tenements built upon them, in which case a sanitary assessment maybe levied against the lot for each house situated thereon.
(g)
The governing body of the city, in addition to being authorized to assess, levy, and impose taxes for sanitary purposes, as set forth hereinabove in subsection (f), shall be authorized to charge fees for the collection, removal or disposal, or both, of all solid waste except body wastes, ashes, street cleanings, dead animals, abandoned automobiles, and market and industrial wastes, such fees to be charged against the owners or, when not owner-occupied, against the occupants, tenants, or lessees of the premises from which the fee is collected, and from which such waste is removed or disposed of, or both, from which collection and removal services are made available.

Section 6-315. - Fund balance policy.
The City will report fund balance amounts consistent with the appropriate Governmental Accounting Standards Board ("GASB") guidance. This policy and the procedures promulgated under it supersede all previous regulations regarding the City's fund balance and reserve policies.
(a)
Fund balance terms. The following fund balance definitions will be recognized:
Fund equity. A fund's equity is generally the difference between its assets and its liabilities. For governmental funds, fund equity is also known as fund balance.
Fund balance. An accounting distinction is made between the portions of fund equity that are spendable and nonspendable. These are broken up into five categories:
(1)
Nonspendable fund balance includes amounts that are not in a spendable form or are required to be maintained intact. Examples are inventory or long term advances to or from other funds.
(2)
Restricted fund balance includes amounts that can be spent only for the specific purposes stipulated by external resource providers either constitutionally or through enabling legislation. Examples include grants and bond covenants.
(3)
Committed fund balance includes amounts that can be used only for the specific purposes determined by a formal action of the government's highest level of decision-making authority. Commitments may be changed or lifted only by the government taking the same formal action that imposed the constraint originally.
(4)
Assigned fund balance comprises amounts intended to be used by the government for specific purposes. Intent can be expressed by the governing body or by an official or body to which the governing body delegates the authority. In governmental funds other than the general fund, assigned fund balance represents the amount that is not restricted or committed. This indicates that resources in other governmental funds are, at a minimum, intended to be used for the purpose of that fund. Example includes fund balance used to balance the budget.
(5)
Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification of the general fund and includes all amounts not contained in other classifications. Unassigned amounts are technically available for any purpose. The general fund is the only fund that may have a positive balance in this category.
Unrestricted fund balance. The total of committed fund balance, assigned fund balance, and unassigned fund balance, which includes only resources without a constraint on spending or for which the constraint on spending is imposed by the government itself.
(b)
Prioritization of fund balance use.
(1)
When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted (committed, assigned, or unassigned) amounts are available, the City shall consider restricted amounts to have been reduced first.
(2)
When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which amounts in any of the unrestricted fund balance classifications could be used, the City shall first reduce committed amounts, followed by assigned amounts and then unassigned amounts.
(3)
Prior to the fund balance being encumbered for any expenditure in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, five (5) percent of the general fund budget at the beginning of each fiscal year shall be appropriated to a dedicated capital account in the City's Capital Finance Fund, solely for capital investment to ensure adequate annual funding for routine maintenance, repair, and replacement of public infrastructure.
(c)
Authority to commit or assign. Commitments or assignments will only be used for specific purposes. Committed balances or assigned balances will only be established pursuant to a formal action by the City Council, upon recommendation from the Chief Financial Officer. Such commitments or assignments cannot exceed the available fund balance in any particular fund.
(d)
Minimum unrestricted fund balance in the General Fund.
(1)
The City will maintain a minimum unrestricted fund balance ranging from no less than 15 percent to 20 percent of the subsequent year's budgeted expenditures and outgoing transfers.
(2)
At any time that the City's unrestricted fund balance is within the range of 15 percent to 20 percent of the subsequent year's budgeted expenditures and outgoing transfers, upon recommendation by the Chief Financial Officer, Council may authorize additional transfers to fund balance or any deficit fund at its discretion, up to a maximum of five percent per year of the subsequent year's budgeted revenues, in preparation for adoption of the upcoming years' budget.
(e)
Replenishing deficiencies in the General Fund. When the unrestricted fund balance falls below the minimum 15 percent of the subsequent year's budgeted expenditures and outgoing transfers, the City will replenish shortages/deficiencies within the following time periods and, upon recommendation by the Chief Financial Officer, Council may authorize additional transfers to the fund balance at its discretion, up to a maximum of five percent per year of the subsequent year's budgeted revenues, in preparation for adoption of the upcoming years' budget. Sufficient transfers shall be budgeted to restore/replenish deficits within the timelines outlined below:
(i)
Deficiency resulting in a minimum unrestricted fund balance between 12.5 percent and 15 percent shall be replenished over a period not to exceed one year;
(ii)
Deficiency resulting in a minimum unrestricted fund balance between ten percent and 12.5 percent shall be replenished over a period not to exceed three years;
(iii)
Deficiency resulting in a minimum unrestricted fund balance of less than ten percent shall be replenished over a period not to exceed five years.
(f)
Surplus fund balance. Should the unrestricted fund balance of the General Fund exceed the maximum of 20 percent, upon recommendation by the Chief Financial Officer, Council may consider such surplus fund balance as available to reduce deficit balances in other funds and for one-time expenditures that are nonrecurring in nature. At least 50 percent of surplus fund balance must be used to reduce any deficit fund balance prior to allocation for any one-time expenditures. All such expenditures are subject to approval via regular council action.
(g)
Financial reporting. An annual reporting of fund balances as classified in accordance with GASB 54 shall be as reported in the annual Audited Financial Statements of the City of Atlanta.

All surface parking lots with a total of 30 or more parking spaces, whether primary or accessory in use and whether commercial or noncommercial, shall have minimum barrier curb and landscaping requirements as follows:
(1)
Barrier curbs shall be installed around the perimeter of the parking lot and around landscaped areas that are required herein, except where the perimeter abuts an adjacent building or structure and at points of ingress and egress into the facility, so as to prevent encroachment of vehicles onto adjacent property, rights-of-way and landscape areas.
(2)
Barrier curbs shall be a minimum of six inches in height and a minimum of eight inches in width and permanent in nature. Barrier curbs shall be concrete or stone. Such curbs shall be securely installed and maintained in good condition.

(5)
A minimum of one tree per eight parking spaces shall be included in the required landscaped areas. For the purposes of satisfying this requirement, existing trees that are two and one-half inches or more in caliper as measured at a height 36 inches above ground level, shall be considered to be equivalent to one or more newly planted trees on the basis of one tree for each two and one-half inches in caliper.
(6)
In addition to trees, ground cover shall be provided in order to protect tree roots and to prevent erosion. Ground cover shall consist of shrubs, ivy, liriope, pine bark mulch, and other similar landscaping materials.
(7)
Shrubs shall be maintained at a maximum height of two and one-half feet, except where such shrubs are screening the parking surface from an adjacent residential use.
(8)
In the event that landscaped areas are in the interior of a parking lot they shall be a minimum of six feet in width and six feet in length with a minimum area of 36 square feet.
(9)
Continuous landscaped buffer strips shall be constructed along sidewalks and public rights-of-way where surface parking lots are adjacent to such sidewalks or public rights-of-way, except at points of ingress and egress into the facility. Such landscaped buffer strips shall be a minimum of five feet in width and shall contain, in addition to ground cover, trees planted a maximum of 42.5 feet on center along the entire length.
(10)
Newly planted trees shall be a minimum of two and one-half inches in caliper as measured at a height six inches above ground level; shall be a minimum of ten feet in height; shall have a 40-foot minimum mature height and shall be drought-tolerant. Trees shall be planted a minimum of 30 inches from any barrier curb, so as to prevent injury to trees from vehicle bumpers.
(11)
Where landscaped areas are located adjacent to vehicle overhangs, the trees shall be planted in line with the side stripes between parking spaces in order to avoid injury to trees by vehicle bumpers.
(12)
All landscaped areas, including trees located in the public right-of-way that are counted in the fulfillment of this requirement, shall be properly maintained in accordance with approved landscape plans. In the event that a tree or any plant material dies, it shall be replaced within six months so as to meet all requirements of this section and to allow for planting in the appropriate planting season.
(13)
Notwithstanding subsection (4) above, existing parking lots shall not be required to reduce the number of parking spaces by more than three percent as a result of implementing these landscaping regulations.
(14)
If it is determined by the bureau of planning that implementation of these regulations will result in the loss of parking spaces in existing lots, the director of the bureau of traffic and transportation may increase the percentage of allowable compact car spaces from 25 percent up to 35 percent so as to minimize the loss of parking spaces.
(15)
Administrative variances may be granted by the director, bureau of planning only upon making all of the following findings:
(a)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, topography, subsurface conditions, overhead structures or the existence of sufficient trees in the public right-of-way within ten feet of the property line;
(b)
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
(c)
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Atlanta.
(16)
Owners, lessees, or authorized agents of existing parking lots shall be required to submit a landscaping plan within 12 months of the effective date of this section, which illustrates the proposed application of these landscaping regulations. Within six months of the receipt of said landscaping plans, the bureau of planning shall approve these landscaping plans or develop alternative plans which meet the requirements. Within 24 months of the effective date of this section, all required landscaping shall be implemented.

Sec. 2-323. - Investing of city funds.
(a)
Policy. It is the policy of the city to invest public funds in a manner that will provide maximum security and the best commensurate yield while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the city. This investment policy has been written in compliance with authority granted in Section 2-323 of the Atlanta City Code, O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4 and § 36-82-7, as it may be from time to time amended and will set forth the guidelines and objectives necessary to achieve a prudent cash and investment management program.
(b)
Scope. This policy governs the investment of the "Restricted Investment Portfolio," and the "General Fund Portfolio", collectively known as the "Total Investment Portfolio." The restricted investment portfolio is comprised primarily of the debt service sinking funds and construction funds resulting from the proceeds of various city bond issues. These bond funds are unique in that they have associated legal covenants which detail specific types of legal investment instruments as per bond issue. The restricted investment portfolio shall be structured to meet known debt service payments and construction draw schedules. In addition to this policy, bond proceeds and other bond funds (including debt service and reserve funds) shall be invested in accordance with governing ordinance and by the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, including all regulations and rulings promulgated thereunder applicable to the issuance of tax-exempt obligations.
The general investment portfolio is the largest portfolio, consisting of 16 funds that make up the concentration account. This portfolio encompasses the city's primary operating funds which include the general fund as well as various enterprise funds. The general investment portfolio shall be diversified by maturity date and structured to meet all anticipated net outflows that are projected to occur.
This policy shall be made available to anyone who has management responsibility for city funds, and in the absence of their specific investment policy, or not being otherwise governed by state law, this policy shall prevail. With respect to the funds of non-profit corporations that are established by city resolution and act as instrumentalities of the city, it is recommended that the city's investment policy be followed.
(1)
Funds covered by this policy and managed as part of the pooled general investment portfolio:
(2)
Funds covered by this policy and managed as part of the pooled restricted investment portfolio are as follows:
Bond funds—Funds established with the proceeds from specific bond issues when it is determined that segregating these funds from the pooled funds portfolio will result in maximum interest earnings retention under the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Bond reserve funds—Funds set at prescribed levels by certain bond ordinances to pay principal and/or interest if required to prevent default.
(3)
Funds not governed by this policy include:
General Employee's Pension Fund;
Firefighters Pension Fund;
Police Officers Pension Fund.
Endowment funds—Funds given to the city with the instructions that the principal is to remain intact, unless otherwise agreed to, and the income generated by the investments will be used for specified purposes.
(c)
Objective. Investment of the funds covered by this policy shall be governed by the following investment objectives, in order of priority:
(1)
Legality. All investments shall fully comply with federal, state, and local laws. Additional requirements are discussed in the authorized and suitable investment section of this investment policy.
(2)
Safety. Safety of principal is the primary objective of the investment policy. Investment of the city's funds shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital for the overall portfolio. To attain this objective, investment in only high quality securities and diversification are required in order that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of the portfolio (see subsection (m) "Diversification and maximum maturities").
(3)
Liquidity. The city's investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the city to meet all operating requirements that might be reasonably anticipated.
(4)
Yield. The city's investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return, throughout budgetary and economic cycles, while taking into consideration the investment risk constraints and cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.
(d)
Delegation of authority. The chief financial officer shall assume ultimate responsibility regarding investment decisions on behalf of the city. Under the provisions of state and city codes, the chief financial officer has the ability to designate an employee of the department of finance to manage the daily investment of city funds. This responsibility has been designated to the Director - Treasury Services, who assumes the day-to-day investment decisions. All those responsible for making investment decisions shall be collectively referred to as "investment officers" for purposes of this policy. The chief financial officer is authorized to create forms and questionnaires deemed necessary to assist in the evaluation and selection of broker/dealers that will be required to be completed by that third-party in order to comply with the city's investment policies and state laws.
(e)
Controls and procedures. The chief financial officer or his designee shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program consistent with this investment policy. Such procedures shall include explicit delegation of authority to any other persons responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the written procedures. Authority granted to a person to invest the city's funds is effective until rescinded or until termination of the person's employment by the city. The chief financial officer shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials. Both the chief financial officer and the cash and investment manager shall possess sufficient working knowledge of economics and securities markets, as well as the supervisory experience and judgment necessary to carry out the responsibilities outlined in this policy.
Formal written procedures shall also include but not be limited to:
(1)
A formal process that outlines procedures relating to the purchase and sale of securities.
(2)
A formal reporting system to monitor the performance of investment securities held. This system shall include written reports as outlined in subsection (o) of this policy.
(3)
A reconciliation process that compares third-party security confirmations to internally produced reports and trade tickets.
(4)
Performance measurement through the use of appropriate benchmarks that share the same characteristics of the general investment portfolio.
(5)
A system of compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of the Government Accounting Standards Board (GSFB).
(6)
A system of internal controls, designed to detect errors, misrepresentation or imprudent actions.
(7)
Thorough cross training of department employees to allow for back up of critical investment duties.
(8)
An annual review of investment operations.
(f)
Prudence. Investment officers shall adhere to the "prudence investor" standard as suggested by the Government Finance Officer's Association (GFOA), which states that:
"Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived."
(1)
The "prudent investor" standard shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers who exercise due diligence and act in accordance with the investment policy and written procedures, shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
(2)
Investment officers, while acting in accordance with this policy and written procedures pertaining to the administration and management of the city's assets, and who exercise proper due diligence, shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided that deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control and prevent any further adverse developments.
(3)
Securities shall not be purchased with trading or speculation as the dominant selection criteria.
(g)
Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions.
(1)
Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business.
(2)
Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall disclose any large personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio. The city statute on conflict of interest and disclosure shall be strictly followed.
(h)
Authorized and suitable investments. City funds governed by this policy may be invested in the instruments described below, all of which are authorized by O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4. However, investments in instruments other than government securities shall be made only if the yield is equal to or greater than the bond equivalent yield on U.S. Treasury obligations of comparable maturity.
Investments not listed below, including collateralized mortgage obligations and reverse repurchase agreements, are strictly prohibited. In addition, the investment officers may at times restrict or prohibit the purchase of specific issues due to current market conditions.
An investment that requires a minimum rating under this section does not qualify, as an authorized investment during the period the investment does not have the minimum rating. The city shall take all prudent measures consistent with this investment policy to liquidate an investment that does not have the minimum rating.
The following securities are authorized under O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4:

Daily repurchase agreement;
(2)
Short-term discount paper purchases;

Transactions with the local government investment pools (which are deemed to be made at prevailing market rates);
(4)
Treasury and agency securities purchased at issue or "to be announced" (TBA) through an approved broker/dealer or financial institution; or
(5)
Automatic overnight "sweep" transactions with the city depository.
In situations where the exact security being offered is not offered by other dealers, offers on the closest comparable investment may be used to establish a fair market price for the security.
All bid and offers received shall be documented and retained on individual trade tickets or in trade logs. It shall be the responsibility of the investment officer associated with the transaction to record the following minimum information: Financial institution selected, rate quoted, security description, cover bids/offers, and special considerations in the event that the lowest priced security was not selected.
(k)
Collateralization. The city requires that all uninsured collected balances plus accrued interest, if any, in depository accounts be secured in accordance with this policy. Financial institutions serving as city depositories will be required to sign a depository agreement with the city which details eligible collateral, collateralization ratios, standards for collateral custody and control, collateral valuation, rights of substitution and conditions for agreement termination.
The city requires that all securities purchased under the terms of a repurchase agreement be assigned to the city, with clearly marked evidence of ownership through safekeeping receipts.

Collateral will always be held by an independent third party with whom the city has a current custodial agreement and shall be reviewed at least monthly to ensure that the market value of the pledged securities is adequate. The right of collateral substitution may be granted after obtaining prior approval from the city.
(1)
Securities authorized for collateral under this policy are limited to those investments outlined in subsection (h)(1) through (h)(3).
(2)
The collateralization level for repurchase agreements shall be 102 percent of the market value of principal and accrued interest.
(3)
Depository products including certificates of deposit.
(4)
The collateralization level for certificates of deposit shall be 110 percent in accordance to the Georgia Code O.C.G.A. § 45-8-12.
(l)
Safekeeping and custody. Safekeeping and custody of securities and collateral shall be in accordance with state law. All securities transactions, except local government investment pool and money market mutual fund transactions, shall be conducted on a delivery versus payment (DVP) basis. Securities and collateral will be held by a third party custodian designated by the city, and held in the city's name as evidenced by original safekeeping receipts of the institution with which the securities are deposited. The custodian shall also provide monthly safekeeping statements that contain sufficient detail of securities held including, but not limited to, par, security type, CUSIP, maturity date, coupon and market value. Similarly, the city or the city's designated custodian shall take delivery of securities pledged as collateral on repurchase agreements with primary dealer firms. In repurchase transactions involving local banks, delivery is only required on agreements whose terms
(m)
Diversification. The city shall seek to ladder the maturities of the portfolio to correspond with known projected cash flow needs, taking into consideration large reoccurring expenditure items such as payroll and bond disbursements.
The city shall seek to ladder the maturities of the portfolio to correspond with known liquidity needs, taking into consideration large reoccurring expenditure items such as payroll and bond disbursements. The city shall seek to maintain a weighted-average maturity of the total portfolio not to exceed five years and shall limit the maturity of any single security to five years.
The city's investment portfolios, in aggregate, should be diversified to limit market and credit risk in general accord with the following limitations:
EXPAND
Investment Type Maximum

  (1)
The collateralization level for certificates of deposit shall be 110 percent in accordance to O.C.G.A. § 45-8-2.
(2)
The city shall have the authority to invest up to $100,000,000.00 in municipal bonds which do not meet the maximum maturity and ratings guidelines above. Those $100,000,000.00 of municipal bonds will be allowed to have single security maximum maturities of up ten years and minimum investment grade ratings (BBB-/Baa3/BBB-). All other criteria herein will be still need to be met.
The above allocation levels are intended to serve as guidelines for the investment manager. The allocation may be adjusted in response to changing market conditions, cash flow requirements and the discretion of the chief financial officer.
Capital projects funds are further limited by certain arbitrage restrictions and specific bond covenants. Therefore, prior to investment of these funds, the likelihood of meeting rebate exceptions should be determined, and authorized investments as per the official bond statements shall be verified.
(3)
With respect to bond proceeds and other bond funds, the city may, in the bond ordinance, specifically authorize investments in repurchase agreements with maturities in excess of 180 days subject to any required approvals from bond insurers.
(n)
Security swap transactions. The city will seek to maximize its investment opportunities, when advantageous to do so, by selling securities that have become expensive or "rich" to the market and simultaneously purchasing similar securities that offer a higher relative return. This concurrent purchase and sales is commonly referred to as a "swap." The goal of this transaction type is to:
(1)
Improve the quality of the portfolio by selling a security with a higher risk and buying a security with a lower risk;
(2)
Adjusting the target duration of the portfolio; or
(3)
Increase yield by purchasing a security with a higher relative return than the security being sold.
In certain instances, the city may incur a loss for accounting purposes in the sale of a security during a swap transaction. Such a loss will be considered acceptable only if the loss on the sale is expected to be smaller than the difference in yield advantage over the horizon period.
If a broker/dealer proposes a swap idea, that same broker/dealer shall be given a "last look" opportunity to match the lowest offer or highest bid.
(o)
Portfolio monitoring. All trading losses incurred shall be reported immediately to the chief financial officer with appropriate documentation that formed the basis for the transaction. A summary of trading gains and losses shall be provided to the chief financial officer not less than monthly basis in order to determine the propriety of trading activity. This information will be included in the quarterly investment report.
While this policy prescribes various maximum and minimum limitations, it is intended primarily as a management tool. When the chief financial officer determines that an exception to one of the policy's numerical limits is in the best interest of the city, and is otherwise consistent with the investment policy, such exception is permitted so long as it is likewise consistent with applicable city, state and federal laws. All exceptions made to this policy and the appropriate explanation or justification for the exceptions shall be reported in the quarterly investment report.
Whenever an exception is caused by an inadvertent breach of these policies, that fact shall be reported in writing to the mayor and city council. Such report shall be made on a timely basis, but no later than five business days from the discovery date of the policy exception.
(p)
Reporting. The cash and investment manager shall prepare a quarterly investment report. This report which will include a summary of the current status of the general investment portfolio and security transactions made over the prior quarter, will be delivered to each council member and the mayor. The quarterly investment report shall include:
(1)
A review of the bond market and U.S. economy;
(2)
Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the portfolio (in accordance with GASB requirements);
(3)
Security allocation and maturity distribution of the portfolio;
(4)
Portfolio characteristics as measured against selected benchmarks;
(5)
Proposed portfolio strategy for the next reporting period;
(6)
Detail of portfolio holdings; and
(7)
Statement of compliance with written investment policy.
The above stated components of the portfolio performance reports can be adjusted at the discretion of the chief financial officer.
In addition, the portfolio shall be marked-to-market monthly and a report shall be produced and distributed to the chief financial officer showing realized/unrealized gains and losses on the portfolio at the end of each monthly reporting period.
(q)
Investment strategies. The following strategies may be used to maximize return on investments:
(1)
Asset/liability matching—Matching maturities to anticipated cash flow requirements. This strategy could extend the average weighted maturity of a subset of the portfolio and the absolute maturity of securities within the portfolio.
(2)
Matching maturities to anticipated cash flow requirements. At times, this strategy may be exited.
(3)
Maturity extension—A positive sloping or "normal" yield curve rewards longer-term investments. All purchase decisions that do not involve the matching of known cash needs shall be based on an analysis of the relative yield benefit to lengthening the maturity.
(4)
Determination of an investment's relative value—By following historical spread relationships between different security types and issuers, it is possible to determine the securities that offer the best yield value on any given day. The city will seek to invest funds in the highest yielding investment security within established policy guidelines for safety and liquidity.
(5)
Market opportunities—Although money markets are generally efficient, there are opportunities for yield enhancement by selling securities that become unusually "expensive" or high in price, and purchasing similar securities that are considered "cheap" or low in price. These "swap" opportunities often occur as the spreads between different types of securities narrow or widen.
(6)
Anticipating market changes—Although it is not possible to consistently predict market trends, an understanding of the factors that affect the market is important when determining an optimal maturity for the portfolio. Trading is not to be made solely on the basis of interest rate forecasts, but specific decisions involving maturity dates should consider short-term market expectations.
(r)
Performance measurement. The investment performance of the City of Atlanta will be evaluated quarterly by comparison to established benchmarks. The selection of the benchmarks will be based upon the investment strategy and length of the investment portfolio and shall be approved by the chief financial officer and the city council. The city currently measures performance against the following indices:
(1)
Three-Month Constant Maturity (CMT) Treasury Index.
(2)
One-Year Constant Maturity (CMT) Treasury Index.
(3)
Three-Year Treasury Rate.
(4)
Five-Year Treasury Rate.
(s)
Training. The investment officers and the persons authorized to execute investment transactions shall attend at least one investment training session within 12 months after taking office or assuming duties and receive not less than eight hours of instruction relating to investment responsibilities every two years. Within 12 months of assuming investment duties, investment officers will be required to acquire the Certified Treasury Professional (CTP) designation and enroll in the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) program.
(t)
Investment policy adoption. The city's investment policy is hereby adopted by ordinance of the Atlanta City Council.
