(Ord. No. 2006-09, § 3(Att. C), 3-14-06)
Sec. 16-20N.006. - General regulations.
The following general regulations shall apply to all properties located within the district.
1.
[Standards.] In the district, the commission shall apply the standards referenced below only if the standards set forth elsewhere in this chapter 20N do not specifically address the application or any portion of the application:
(a)
The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved.
(b)
The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property shall be avoided.
(c)
Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes shall not be undertaken that create a false sense of historic development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties.
(d)
Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
(e)
Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques, or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property, shall be preserved.
(f)
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, texture, and, where possible, materials.
(g)
Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used.
(h)
Archaeological resources shall be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
(i)
New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction, shall not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work may be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment.
(j)
New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
(k)
Contemporary design for new construction and for additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such new construction and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such construction or additions satisfy section 16-20N.007 or section 16-20N.008, as applicable.
(l)
The height of a structure shall be measured on the façade facing the public street and measurement shall be taken from the highest point of such grade to the top of the parapet wall.
2.
Compatibility rule.
(a)
The intent of the regulations and guidelines is to ensure that alterations and additions to existing structures and new construction are compatible with the design, proportions, scale, and general character of the block face, the entire block, a particular subarea or the district as a whole. To permit flexibility, some regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule, which states: "Where not quantifiable, the element in question (building proportion, roof form, fenestration, etc.) shall match that which predominates on the contributing buildings in the subarea. Where quantifiable, the element in question (i.e., distance of first floor above sidewalk grade), shall be no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimensions of the contributing buildings in the subarea."
(b)
Those elements to which the rule applies are noted in the regulations by a reference to the "compatibility rule."
3.
Variances, special exceptions, and appeals. Variance applications, applications for special exceptions, and appeals from these regulations shall be heard by the commission. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, and criteria for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this part 16. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny applications for special exceptions pursuant to the standards in chapter 25. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny applications for appeal pursuant to the standards in section 16-30.010 and the appeal provisions for said decision, set forth in section 16-30.010(e), shall also apply to the commission's decision.
4.
Financial hardship exemptions.
(a)
These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance other equally important objectives of economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations to a property owner's principal residence on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner.
(b)
The burden of proving economic hardship by a preponderance of the evidence shall be on the applicant.
(c)
The commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted:
i.
The present income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property.
ii.
The age of the property owner.
iii.
The length of time the property owner has resided in the neighborhood or in the residence for which the exemption is sought.
iv.
The availability of other sources of funds that are appropriate to the circumstances of the applicant, including loans, grants and tax abatements.
v.
The costs associated with adherence to these regulations.
vi.
The degree of existing architectural significance and integrity of the structure; and
vii.
The purpose and intent of this chapter.
(d)
The commission shall consider these factors and shall grant an exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate upon a finding that the applicant's economic hardship outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations.
5.
Subdivisions of lots. The subdivision of any lot within this district shall be subject to review and approval by the commission. No subdivision of lots shall be approved by the director of the bureau of planning unless said matter has first been submitted to and approved by the commission. The commission shall find that the resulting lots are so laid out that buildings that are compatible in design, proportion, scale, and general character of a particular subarea or the district as a whole, may be reasonably situated and constructed upon such lots.
6.
Aggregation of lots. No lots shall be aggregated except upon approval of the commission. Applications shall be made to the commission. The commission shall find that the resulting lots are so laid out that buildings that are compatible in design, proportion, scale, and general character of the subarea, and the district as a whole, may be reasonably situated and constructed upon such lots.
7.
Tree preservation and replacement. The provisions of the City of Atlanta Tree Ordinance, Atlanta City Code section 158-26, shall apply to this district.
8.

(a)
All new construction, alterations, or additions that increase the number of dwelling units and/or increase the square footage of nonresidential uses, or any change in use shall include the required off-street parking.
