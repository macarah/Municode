DIVISION 11. - TRANSFERS, DEMOTIONS AND REEMPLOYMENT

Sec. 114-361. - Transfers.
(a)
Generally. A regular employee may be transferred to meet the needs of the civil service or may be transferred, upon request and acceptance, to a position in the same class or in a different class having the same entrance salary. A transfer may require the employee to move from one department to another or within a department. When an employee is transferred to a "position of trust," a criminal background check is administered as a condition to transfer. A credit check shall be conducted if such transfer warrants such action based on job relatedness.
(b)
Intradepartmental transfers. The appropriate department head may, at any time, reassign an employee of the department in the civil service from one position to another in the same class or another class within the same pay range within the same department.
(c)
Interdepartmental transfers. A transfer of an employee from one department to another shall have the approval of the commissioner of human resources and the two concerned department heads. Requests for such transfer shall establish that the employee meets the qualification requirements of the class to which the transfer is proposed.
(d)
Salary range after transfer. An employee who is transferred shall continue to receive the same rate of pay, except as otherwise provided.
(e)
Transfer of physically incapacitated employee. If an employee becomes physically incapacitated to the extent that such employee is unable to perform the duties of the employee's position, the commissioner of human resources may, with the consent of such employee and the appointing authority, transfer the employee to another position in the same pay range, the duties of which such employee can perform despite the physical incapacity.
(f)
Use of intradepartmental or interdepartmental transfer for retaliation. Notwithstanding the foregoing subparagraphs, no employee shall be subject to intradepartmental or interdepartmental transfer in retaliation or response to engaging in a protected activity such as reporting fraud, waste or abuse in city government.

Involuntary demotions. An appointing authority may demote, for just cause, an employee under such authority's jurisdiction from a position in one class to a position in a lower class, provided that the employee involved and the commissioner of human resources have been notified in writing of such contemplated action. Pay shall be calculated consistent with section 114-128
(b)
Voluntary demotions. Subject to the approval of the applicable appointing authority and the commissioner of human resources and upon the request of an employee, such an employee may be demoted to a vacant position in a lower class.

Sec. 114-363. - Reemployment.
