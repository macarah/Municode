Chapter 43 - COMMERCIAL SOLICITATION

Sec. 43-1. - Commercial solicitation.
(a)
Definitions:
"Commercial solicitation" or "to commercially solicit" is any request made in person on a street, sidewalk, or public place, without a permit, asking for an immediate donation of money or other thing of value, including the purchase of an item or service for an amount far exceeding its value, under circumstances where a reasonable person would understand that the purchase is a donation. Commercial solicitation shall not include passively standing or sitting with a sign or other indication that one is seeking donations without addressing the request to any specific person.
"Outreach team evaluator" shall mean an individual counselor or group of counselors authorized and designated by the mayor to provide access to community outreach services for individuals with mental health diagnoses and/or drug and alcohol complications, or other medical or social services needs. The outreach team evaluator shall make recommendations that an individual receive community outreach services, and may take reasonable steps toward directing the person to the appropriate community outreach program service provider, including but not limited to offering transportation to such provider. An outreach team evaluator shall not have the authority to compel an individual to receive community outreach services.
"Community outreach services" means a public or private services provider that offers residential and/or rehabilitative medical or social services assistance, including but not limited to mental health treatment, drug or alcohol rehabilitation, or homeless assistance services for individuals in need thereof. The mayor shall determine what service providers constitute an eligible community outreach service provider for purposes of this section.
"Evaluation" means the written assessment of an individual's mental health, the presence of drug and alcohol complications, or other medical or social service needs by visual analysis and/or by verbal communication with the individual. Evaluation may be performed by either an outreach team evaluator or a law enforcement officer. An evaluation shall not serve to compel an individual to receive community outreach services nor shall an evaluation serve to increase the penalty assessed as provided for in section 43-6.
