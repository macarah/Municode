The bond clerk at the election of the principal may remit part of the cash bond to the particular court involved in payment of the fine and remit the balance of the cash bond to the principal. Nothing in this section shall in any way limit or prohibit the bond clerk from refunding any forfeited bond when the prisoner is produced prior to the issuance of an execution.

The chief of corrections or designated representatives and the chief judge and the associate judges of the municipal court are authorized to receive appearance or other bonds of defendants and witnesses, in the form of cash or property, or cash or written bonds of professional bondspersons, as they shall deem necessary, to secure the attendance of defendants and witnesses in municipal court. If a particular defendant is charged with two or more offenses and bond is deemed necessary, a separate bond shall be set for each offense. The bond shall remain in full force and effect until the disposition of the case and until the defendant is surrendered. It shall be left to the sound discretion of the chief of corrections or designated representatives to take and accept bonds, to determine the solvency of any tendered surety and to do all in their power to protect the city against loss if a forfeiture occurs. The mayor may require professional bondspersons to deposit with the chief financial officer a sufficient fund to protect the interests of the city. The chief of corrections or designated representatives and the chief judge and associate judges of the municipal court shall promptly forward all bonds to the clerk of the court.

Sec. 62-83. - Bond signed by surety through agent acting under power of attorney.
If an officer or employee of the department of corrections or clerk of the municipal court is charged with the duty of accepting and passing on the legality of an appearance or other bond, such officer or clerk may accept a bond signed by a surety through an agent acting under the power of attorney, whether the surety is a surety company or person, if the power is properly executed by the surety. However, the bond shall not be accepted, though the power of attorney is properly executed, if the officer or clerk passing upon the adequacy of the bond is not satisfied that the agent has authority to act for the alleged principal, and no power of attorney executed by a surety company shall be accepted by an officer unless this company has complied with the rules and regulations of the city and laws of the state. The bond shall not be accepted by the officer or clerk unless the person appearing before the officer or clerk, requesting to sign the bond, is an agent having the power of attorney to bind the surety, whether the surety is a company, corporation, firm, partnership, association or individual, and such person shall exhibit the power of attorney authorizing such person to bind the surety before being allowed to execute the bond.

(2)
The prosecuting attorney must be given at least 20 days' notice before a hearing is held on the application for remission and must be furnished with copy of the application along with the affidavits and other documentation and evidence supporting such application. Remission shall be granted on the condition of the payment of costs by the surety.
(e)

This delivery of the principal shall discharge the surety of all further liability upon this bond, and the court shall after final judgment relieve the surety of the penalty of the bond upon the surrender of the principal. The chief of corrections or designated representative shall promptly advise the bond administrator and the particular court involved of any principal surrendered.

If a person has been arrested and has posted bond to appear at the trial for the offense charged, a fee or charge having been paid to a professional bondsperson for this bond, and if this person is subsequently arrested for a different offense while out on bail, this subsequent arrest shall not operate as a discharge of the bail on the original offense if the person gives bond on the subsequent different offense. Upon this occurring, no professional bondsperson shall be entitled to collect an additional fee or make an additional charge for providing a bond on the original offense, the original bond remaining in effect upon the posting of bond on the subsequent different offense.
