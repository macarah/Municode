Any persons obtaining a building permit shall pay, to the City of Atlanta, fees in accordance with the value of the proposed work per square foot of building in addition to any application fee charged in Section 104.1. For purposes of this section, the minimum value of proposed new work (including new work to existing structures) shall be based on Table 100, Building Valuation Data provided by the International Code Council as updated February 2009 and as set forth herein. Valuation of alteration projects shall be based upon the estimated construction costs for new work. Minimum value for interior alterations without engineered structural work shall be 20% of the valuation of new building construction. For interior alterations involving structural engineering, the minimum valuation shall be 40% of the value of new building construction. The factor shall apply only the square footage being altered in the application and not the entire structure.

(e)
The fee for changing the contractor of record on a permit or permit application shall be $50.00.
