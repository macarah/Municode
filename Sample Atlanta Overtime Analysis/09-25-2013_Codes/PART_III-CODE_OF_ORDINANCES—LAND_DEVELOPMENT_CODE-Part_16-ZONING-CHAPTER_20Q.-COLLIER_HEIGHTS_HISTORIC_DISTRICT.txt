(3)
The compatibility rule. In general, the intent of the regulations and guidelines is to ensure that alterations to existing structures and new construction are compatible with the design, proportions, scale, massing, and general character of the contributing buildings in the immediately adjacent environment of the block face, the entire block, or the district as a whole. To permit flexibility, many regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule, which states: "The element in question (i.e. roof form, architectural trim, façade material, window type and material, etc.) shall match that which predominates on the contributing buildings of the same architectural style and like use on that block face or, where quantifiable (i.e., buildings height, setbacks, lot dimensions, etc.), no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing buildings of the same architectural style and like use on that block face."
(a)
For the purposes of the compatibility rule, height and width shall be measured at the front façade.
(b)
Those elements to which the rule applies are noted in the regulations by a reference to the "compatibility rule."
(c)
When no structure exists on a block face that would qualify as a comparable structure under the compatibility rule, the comparisons shall be made to a qualifying structure(s) on the block, and if no such structure exists on the block, the comparison shall be made to a qualifying structure(s) on an adjacent block race or block, and if no such structure exists on an adjacent block face or block, the comparison shall be made to a qualifying structure(s) located in the district.
(4)
Variances and special exceptions. The commission shall have the power to hear, grant and deny variances and special exceptions from the provisions of this chapter (20Q) when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship other then financial hardship. The procedures, standards, criteria, and appeal provisions for decisions regarding such variances and special exceptions shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this part 16, which provisions are hereby incorporated herein.
(5)
Financial hardship exemptions.
(a)
These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner.
(b)
In order to qualify for a financial hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purposes.
(c)
The burden of proof that the regulations pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner. If the commission finds that the requirement of subsection (5) herein is satisfied, they may grant an exemption, in whole or in part, only in accordance with the following factors, standards and criteria:
i.
The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property;
ii.
The availability, at present or in the future, of other sources of income or revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements;
iii.
The costs associated with adherence to the district regulations;
iv.
The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; and
v.
The purpose and intent of this chapter.
The commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the financial hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations.
(6)
Subdivision and consolidation. The platting pattern of the district is an integral part of the historic character of the district. No subdivision or consolidation shall be approved unless it can be shown that the proposed subdivision or consolidation is substantially consistent with the historic character or platting pattern of the district. In addition to the requirements of the subdivision and zoning ordinances, including but not limited to sections 15-08.002(a)(2) and 15-08.005(d)(6), all subdivisions or consolidations of lots shall conform to the historic platting pattern in the district with regard to lot size, dimensions, and configurations. The compatibility rule shall apply, and no subdivision or consolidation shall be approved unless and until the commission has made a finding that it is consistent with this provision or with the historic platting pattern of the district and that the resulting lots are so laid out that buildings that are compatible in design, proportion, scale, and general character of the block face, may be reasonably situated and constructed upon such lots.
