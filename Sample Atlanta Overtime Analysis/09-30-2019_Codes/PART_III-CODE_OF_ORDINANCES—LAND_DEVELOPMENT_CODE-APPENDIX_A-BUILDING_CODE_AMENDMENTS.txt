With respect to an application not approved for issuance of the building permit, "no activity" shall mean that the applicant of record has not responded to the director's written notification that additional information or correction of any of the required plans is required before further processing of the application can take place or that the applicant has failed to submit corrections to plans or additional information after having received the director's written instructions. Such written notifications may be made by e-mail or by other means such as dated notations during plan reviews where the applicant or a representative is present.
(ii)
With respect to an application approved for issuance of the building permit, "no activity" shall mean that the applicant of record has not responded to the director's notification that all required approvals have been obtained and the building permit is awaiting issuance and that the final fee payment is due.
(iii)
An expired application shall not be vested against any change in the zoning code, or any applicable building code, or any other ordinance of the City of Atlanta.
(iv)
An expired application may be reactivated by the director, by the payment of the actual cost ($150.00 per hour) to review the plans for any change in the zoning code and any applicable building code but in no case shall this cost be less than $150.00. Reactivation of the application shall not excuse compliance with the provisions of the zoning code, or any applicable building code, or any other ordinance of the City of Atlanta in effect at the time of reactivation.
(v)
Any changes requested to an expired application shall require an additional 50% of the cost of the building permit to cover the cost of review by all affected departments.
(e)
An application shall be cancelled and shall not be reactivated after 365 days of no activity. For the purposes of determining when cancellation of the permit application shall occur, "no activity" shall have the same meaning which applies to the expiration of applications and begin as of the same date that the expiration period begins.
(f)
Extensions of permit applications.
(i)
Upon the request of applicant and payment of the fee required by this subsection prior to the expiration date or cancellation date of the permit application, it may be extended once as of right, for a period of up to 180 days. Any subsequent extensions of 180 days shall be at the discretion of the director, who may only grant further extensions upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances, and, payment of the fee prior to the date of expiration or expiration of the prior extension, provided however that no extension shall vest an application against changes in the zoning code or increases in building permit fee for any period greater than six months from the date when the permit would have first expired.
(ii)
The cost for all permit application extensions shall be $100.00. During the period of the extension, the time for the application to be considered a cancelled permit by the operation of law shall be tolled but the fact that the extension has been granted shall not act to prevent the imposition of additional cost for the reactivation of an expired permit application as set forth above.
(g)
Once the applicant has been contacted in the manner set forth in their application and been informed that all required approvals have been obtained and the building permit does not issue within 365 days of the date of such contact, the permit application shall be cancelled and may not be reactivated. Failure of the applicant to keep their contact information current by notifying the director in writing of the change in the contact information shall not extend the time before cancellation may occur.
(h)
The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans and specifications shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of any violation of any of the provisions of this Code. No permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this Code shall be valid, except insofar as the work or use which it authorizes is lawful.
(i)
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the building official from issuing a permit for the construction of a part of a building or structure before the entire plans and detailed statements of said building or structure have been submitted or approved. No permit issued pursuant to this section shall vest any rights in the applicant or permit holder in a manner that would excuse any failure to fully comply with all applicable requirements of the City Code prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy and all work that is done shall be fully at the risk of the permit holder.
(j)
Interior work on the build-out of commercial buildings is permitted prior to the final approval of building plans provided however that such work shall be limited to the use of metal stud members. Such work can only be performed by a licensed contractor and shall require the submission of plans and the payment of a $200.00 nonrefundable "fast-track metal stud only" additional application fee. Any licensed contractor applying for such application shall acknowledge at the time of initial permit application that the work is entirely at risk and that any work not in conformity with the code or the plans must be corrected. The issuance of "fast-track metal stud only" permit through the additional application fee shall not excuse compliance from any requirement of Code or of other ordinances of the City of Atlanta, Georgia prior to issuance of a regular permit.
(k)
The issuance of a permit based on applications, plans and/or specifications shall not prevent the director from thereafter requiring the correction of errors when in violation of this Code or of other ordinances of the City of Atlanta, Georgia.
(l)
Information provided by an applicant of record including all details shown on the plans submitted shall be presumed to be given to the City with the consent of the owner and shall be binding with respect to all actions taken by the City in reliance upon such information. The submission of the application shall be sufficient for this presumption to become effective and signature of the applicant or owner is not required for the information to be considered a representation binding on the applicant or owner that the information in the application is truthful.
104.2. - FEES.
Any persons obtaining a building permit shall pay, to the City of Atlanta, fees in accordance with the value of the proposed work per square foot of building in addition to any application fee charged in Section 104.1. For purposes of this section, the minimum value of proposed new work (including new work to existing structures) shall be based on Table 100, Building Valuation Data provided by the International Code Council as updated February 2009 and as set forth herein. Valuation of alteration projects shall be based upon the estimated construction costs for new work. Minimum value for interior alterations without engineered structural work shall be 20% of the valuation of new building construction. For interior alterations involving structural engineering, the minimum valuation shall be 40% of the value of new building construction.

The final payment shall be the total of the valuation cost calculation less the plan review cost previously paid. The fact that the valuation cost calculation does not include the amount of development impact fees imposed pursuant to Chapter 19 or other fees imposed elsewhere in the Code does not relieve any applicant from the payment of any fees. No permit is valid until all fees imposed by the City have been paid and the payment validated by the Office of Revenue

(e)
The fee for changing the contractor of record on a permit or permit application shall be $50.00.
(f)

(b)
When a permit has been issued and the job has been cancelled by the applicant, provided no work has commenced on that permit.
(c)
All applications for refunds shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the request. However no refund shall be issued for less than $50.00.
104.3.1. - BUILDING PERMIT FEE REVIEW REQUESTS FOR COMPLETED PROJECTS.
(a)
Applicability. An applicant for a building permit, or the owner of the property which is the subject of the permit (collectively referred to herein as the "owner"), for a project meeting the eligibility requirements herein has the right to request a building permit fee review under the procedures set forth herein.
(b)
Eligibility. For a project to be eligible for building permit fee review, the director shall find:
(i)
The project required the submission of plans and the calculation of the building permit fee from such plans using Table 100;
(ii)
The Table 100 job cost calculation on which the city's building permit fee is based exceeds the actual cost to construct the building or structure which is the subject of the permit (the "project") by more than ten percent as indicated on the building permit application;
(iii)
The owner paid a plan review fee equal to one-half of the building permit fee based on the cost of construction information provided to the director at the time of the submittal of the application for plan review as required by Sec. 104.1(c);
(iv)
The owner paid a final building permit fee payment which is the balance of the fee based on the cost of construction information provided to the director at the time of the submittal of the application for plan review as required by Sec. 104.1(c); and
(v)
The owner gave written notice of the request for a permit fee review, as prescribed herein, at the time of final building permit fee payment.
(c)
Notice. The notice of a request for a permit fee review must contain, at a minimum:
(i)
The permit number;
(ii)
The street address of the project;
(iii)
The permit fee amount paid;
(iv)
The permit holder's approximate expected cost to construct that part of the project for which the review is sought;
(v)
A statement of demand for a permit fee review based on actual cost to construct a completed project including a statement of the amount of the difference (greater than 10%) between the projected permit fee based on Table 100 and the projected permit fee based on owner's expected cost;
(vi)
The name and street address for the person authorized to receive notices from the director. No post office box may be used to receive notice from the director; and
(vii)
A statement agreeing that the payment of a review fee associated with the director's review of the permit fee review request as established by city council will be paid before a final certificate of occupancy is issued.
(d)
Building permit issuance authorized during building permit fee review. If the director finds that an owner is eligible for a building permit fee review, the director may issue a building permit, notwithstanding the requirement of Sec. 104.2(b) that the final permit payment be based on Table 100. While the permit review request is being processed in accordance with the procedures outlined in this section, the director may also conduct all inspections during the course of construction, including final inspection, and issue a temporary certificate of occupancy upon completion of construction. The director shall not issue a final certificate of occupancy until the owner pays the amount set forth in Sec. 104.2(b) or the amount approved by the Atlanta City Council.
(e)
Required submittals for building permit fee review.
(i)
Within 30 days of the date of the issuance of the building permit, the owner shall submit:
(1)
An affidavit from a professional engineer or architect, registered in the State of Georgia swearing that the cost stated in the notice given to the director is expected to be the actual cost to construct the project and shall specifically identify and agree to produce the data on which this statement is based after the temporary certificate of occupancy is issued; and
(2)
An affidavit from the owner, the leaseholder or the person who is responsible for payment of the cost to construct the project, swearing that all forms of payment used to pay the total amount that will be paid to construct the project will be submitted as proof of payment of the job cost amount and further will agree to produce such documents after the temporary certificate of occupancy is issued in conjunction with the audit required by this section. The proof of payment is required to confirm that Table 100 job cost calculation on which the permit fee is based exceed the actual cost to complete the project.
(ii)
Within 90 days after issuance of the temporary certificate of occupancy, the owner shall submit an independent audit of the project (the "audit") prepared by a certified construction manager or a certified public accountant licensed to practice in the State of Georgia (collectively referred to herein as the "auditor") on behalf of the owner for the purpose of seeking a permit fee review from the city. The auditor's report shall make a certified finding as to whether the affidavits submitted by the architect or engineer and the owner of the property fairly represent the cost associated with the construction of the project and the amounts actually paid and state their opinion as to the amount by which the permit fee should be adjusted.
(iii)
A temporary certificate of occupancy issued for the purposes of a permit fee review request shall meet all requirements for the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy so that the most accurate cost to complete the project can be obtained.
(iv)
It shall not be sufficient for the purpose of the permit fee review request to identify contract documents as the only documents which shall form the basis for either affidavit or the permit fee review request and unless both affidavits contain an agreement to produce any document reasonably relevant to the project when requested by the director and to produce such documents upon the directors request, the director may deny the request;
(f)
Review by the director. The following review process shall be substantially followed:
(i)
In evaluating the audit, the director shall be entitled to receive any documentation relied upon by the auditor or such other documents as the director may reasonably deem relevant for review; provided however that such request shall be made by the director within 30 days of the audit. The director may but is not required to engage an auditor to review the submission of the owner. The failure to produce the requested documents to the director within 30 days without cause shall be grounds for the director to consider the request for permit fee review withdrawn.
(ii)
Within 60 days after the director has received all documents requested, the director shall notify the owner in writing of his intent to issue a written recommendation to the Atlanta City Council for either:
(1)
Approval of the amount of the permit fee based on actual costs as requested;
(2)
Approval of a different permit fee amount based on the actual cost to construct; or
(3)
Denial of the permit fee adjustment.
(iii)
The director shall base his recommendation on the findings of the Auditor's report, including any audit commissioned by the director, and all other available documentation establishing the actual cost of construction. The director's failure to make a finding within 60 days after the director has received all documents requested shall be considered a recommendation of denial of the permit fee adjustment as requested by the Owner unless the Owner provides its written consent to allow the director additional review time. Within a reasonable time after, the director shall cause the necessary legislation to be submitted to the Atlanta City Council, with a copy of the director's for a final decision on the permit fee adjustment request.
(g)
Decision by the Atlanta City Council. The Atlanta City Council shall, by ordinance, adopt as its final decision, the recommendation of the director unless there is an expressed finding by the council that the director's recommendation was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or that he acted in an arbitrary manner. In such a case, the Atlanta City Council shall:
(i)
approve of the amount of the permit fee based on actual costs as requested;
(ii)
approve a different permit fee amount based on the actual cost to construct; or
(iii)
deny of the permit fee adjustment.
(h)
Post-decision procedure. The following shall apply:

No other fee review, including without limitation, impact fees, may be requested under this section and the director is not authorized to accept such requests. The director's refusal to accept a fee review request which did not require the submission of plans and the calculation of the amount of the permit fee using the data set forth in Table 100 shall not be subject to the appeal provisions of this section. This section is provided solely to allow the office of buildings to make a determination through the director whether the determination of the job cost valuations by the use of Table 100 has resulted in a fee amount that is consistent with the actual cost to construct a project and is not intended for any other purpose, including without limitation, the appeal of fees determined by other means.
(ii)
Abandonment of project or permit fee review request. With respect to any permit fee review request under an issued permit which is abandoned or withdrawn after work is begun but for which no temporary certificate of occupancy is issued or which has been revoked by the director prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the permit fee review request shall be deemed withdrawn and the owner is liable for any balances due on the permit fee in accordance with Table 100.
(iii)
Penalty for false statement. Any person who knowingly and willfully makes false statements in an affidavit used or attempted to be used to obtain a permit fee adjustment pursuant to this section may be prosecuted under the City Code or applicable state laws, including without limitation O.C.G.A. § 16-10-71, and punished in the manner provided for conviction of such violations.
(iv)
Time limit on temporary certificate of occupancy. The temporary certificate of occupancy issued during the pendency of a permit fee review request shall not remain in effect for more than 180 days after the owner presents the result of the Audit to the director unless an appeal of the Atlanta City Council's decision is filed, in which case the temporary certificate of occupancy shall remain in effect until the appeal is settled or a decision is rendered by the court with jurisdiction over the appeal. The failure to obtain a final certificate of occupancy shall be cause for the director to order the discontinuance of the occupancy of the structure.

c.
Impulsive sound sources shall not exceed 100 dB(c) Leq. measured at a receiving at a receiving property line.
425.2. - SOUND TRANSMISSION CHARACTERISTICS.
All new parking garage, S-2 occupancy group classification exhaust fans and building's emergency generators and HVAC equipment present a unique problem in relation to sound transmission. The following methods shall be utilized to regulate noise transmission:
425.2.1. - Shock Mounting of Site Operational Equipment.
All permanent mechanical equipment, such as exhaust fans, emergency generators, motors, compressors, pumps, and compactors, which are determined by the building official to be a source of structural vibration or structure-borne noise, shall be shock-mounted in inertia blocks or bases and/or vibration isolators in a manner that reduce the contributing factors of noise transmission.
425.2.2. - Noise Mitigation.
A barrier should be designed that directs, reduces, or provides a dense enough barrier to prevent significant noise transmission. If a wall or similar design is used, it must be high enough, and long enough to shield the receiver from adjacent property and direct line of sight to the noise source. Barrier design should be determined through the Acoustical Analysis Report findings.
The building mechanical devices that are common in buildings shall be selected to prevent excessive noise transmission from the new project to adjacent property or common spaces that are considered habitable.
425.2.2.1. - Parapets.
Parapets can be used as a barrier if the Acoustical Analysis Report findings support the sound mitigation but must be installed completely around all rooftop ventilation systems, with dampening materials.
425.2.2.2. - Mechanical Equipment.
All new mechanical equipment associated with onsite development of an S-2 structure shall comply with sound transmission requirements, which prohibits noise from air conditioning, refrigeration, heating, pumps, generators, and filtering equipment from exceeding the ambient noise level to other adjacent properties.

Pressurization Commentary:
1.
Weather conditions may require special consideration in stair and elevator shaft pressurization designs. It may be necessary to introduce outside air heated to approximately the same temperature as is maintained in the building in order to limit pressures within the shafts to the range of pressures required by this subsection.
2.
Stack effect in high rise buildings will make permanently opened louvers in the top of stair and elevator shafts undesirable because of loss of heated air.
3.
Relative to stairway pressurization, reference should be made to the ASHRAE Guides or other appropriate data for door leakage values in order to facilitate design. However, it is noted for information purposes that full scale testing has indicated that leakages of approximately 200 cfm per door are representative, and that the propeller type fan having a characteristic fan performance curve of high volume/low pressure has been found to produce desired results.
506.7. - ELEVATORS.
