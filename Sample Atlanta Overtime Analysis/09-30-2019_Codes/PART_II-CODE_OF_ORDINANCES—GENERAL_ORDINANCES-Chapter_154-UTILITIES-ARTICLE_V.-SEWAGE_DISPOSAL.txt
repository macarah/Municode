Sec. 154-198. - Findings and purposes.
The city finds that, in order to provide for the public health and welfare, and to comply with the laws and regulations of the State of Georgia and the United States Government, it is necessary to set uniform requirements for all users of the water pollution control facilities of the city; to establish effluent limits; to require minimum frequencies of inspections depending upon size of the city sewer system, to require pretreatment, where necessary, by system users; to regulate the use of municipal pollution control facilities through the issuance of permits to certain industrial users; to establish charges and fees for the equitable distribution of costs; and to authorize monitoring and enforcement activities.
The purpose of article V is to prevent the introduction into the municipal pollution control facilities of pollutants which will interfere with the proper operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; to prevent the introduction into the municipal pollution control facilities of pollutants which will cause the city to be in violation of any permits; to prevent the introduction into municipal pollution control facilities of toxic pollutants which would pass through the facilities in toxic amounts, into receiving water or the atmosphere, or otherwise be incompatible with the facilities; to prevent unauthorized discharges of pollutants into the environment; to improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludges from the facilities; and to provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal pollution control facilities.
The city finds that criteria are needed to better control the discharge of grease and oils to the city's sewer system and that due to the diameters of the existing sewer piping system that certain portions of the city require additional inspections to accommodate compliance with this section. The accumulation of grease and oils discharged into the sewer system can lead to grease blockages, which in turn can cause overflows from the sewer system. The city must protect its sewer system against accumulations of grease and oils. Sources of grease and oil discharges include industrial users of the sewer system and food service establishments. Industrial users are subject to industrial user permitting and pretreatment requirements. The best method for reducing discharges of grease and oil from food service establishments is the installation of grease traps at the food service establishment and proper maintenance of the grease traps by the owner or operator of the food service establishment. The sewer use ordinance establishes requirements that control the discharge of grease and oil from industrial sources and food service establishments.

A brief description of the nature, average rate of production and standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by the industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram, site plans, floor plans, and plumbing plans which indicates points of discharge to the water pollution control facility from the regulated processes.
(4)
Number of employees and hours of operation of the facility.
(5)
Information showing the time, duration, and volume, including average daily and maximum daily flow in gallons per day, to the water pollution control facilities from each of the following:
a.
Regulated process streams; and
b.
Other streams as necessary to allow use of a combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR § 403.6(e), if applicable.
(6)
The pretreatment standard applicable to each regulated process.
(7)
The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and subject to the following conditions:
a.
A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, where feasible. The commissioner may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional composite sampling is not feasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the industrial user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged;
b.
The industrial user must take a minimum of three representative samples, in a time frame to be determined by the commissioner, to compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph;
c.
Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR § 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards;
d.
Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using procedures approved by EPA;
e.
A baseline monitoring report may be submitted which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; and
f.
The baseline monitoring report shall indicate the time, date, and place of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the water pollution control facility.
(8)
A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional O&M and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
(9)

Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the commissioner including, as a minimum, whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the commissioner.
(4)
Compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline: Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the wastewater treatment facility, any industrial user subject to pretreatment standards or permit requirements shall submit to the commissioner a report containing the information described in subparagraphs (a)(5) through (a)(8) of this section. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period.
(c)
Reporting of monitoring results: Demonstrating continued compliance with applicable standards. Any industrial user required to self-monitor by the industrial wastewater discharge permit required by subdivision II herein shall submit to the commissioner during the months of January and July, unless required more frequently, a report indicating the nature and concentration or mass, if required, of pollutants in the effluent which are limited in the industrial wastewater discharge permit. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the discharge. At the discretion of the commissioner and in consideration of such factors as high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the commissioner may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. Falsification of self-monitoring reports shall be considered a violation of this article. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the commissioner, the report required by this paragraph shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by this paragraph shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(d)
Self-monitoring and analysis of industrial discharges:
(1)
The monitoring reports required in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where required, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the industrial wastewater discharge permit. The commissioner may allow the use of monitoring results obtained by the city, in lieu of self-monitoring by the industrial user. This will only be granted by permit condition or written authorization from the commissioner.
(2)
If a sampling performed by the industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user shall notify the commissioner within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and shall submit the results of the repeat analysis to the commissioner within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except that the industrial user is not required to resample if (i) the control authority performs the sampling at the industrial user's site at a frequency of at least once per month, or (ii) the control authority performs sampling at the industrial user's site between the time when the industrial user performs its initial sampling and the time when the industrial user receives the results of the sampling.
(3)
The reports required in subparagraph (c) of this section shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the reporting period and must be obtained so as to be representative of the reporting period. The date of month, day of week, and in the case of grab samples, time of day, shall be altered for each sampling cycle.
(4)
The frequency of monitoring to demonstrate compliance shall be prescribed in the industrial wastewater discharge permit. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the EPA pursuant to section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto, or with any other test procedures approved by the EPA. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the EPA. Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analyses techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the city or other parties, and approved by the EPA.
(5)
If an industrial user subject to self-monitoring requirements contained in subparagraph (c) of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the industrial wastewater discharge permit, using procedures prescribed in subparagraph (d)(4) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
(e)
Reporting of potential problems, including slug loadings:
(1)
The industrial user shall notify the commissioner within one hour of becoming aware of any spill, dump, or discharge that could cause problems in the water pollution control facility; including, but not limited to, any slug loading as defined in section 154-196.
(2)
Additionally, within five days of becoming aware of a discharge described in subparagraph(e)(1) of this section, the industrial user must submit a written report to the commissioner. This report shall include the date, time, duration, cause of discharge and, in accordance with section 154-303, provisions of protection against such discharges.
(f)
Reporting of changes in discharge: The industrial user shall notify the commissioner at least 30 days in advance of any change in the facility or pretreatment operations which may substantially change the volume or character of the discharge. Additionally, any industrial user operating under an industrial wastewater discharge permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the commissioner within two business days after the industrial user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month.
(g)
Certification and signatory requirements: The reports required in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall include the following statement: "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or these persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information within this document and attachments is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete.

Sec. 154-215. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(a)
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the commissioner, the state hazardous waste authorities, and the EPA regional waste management division director, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR, Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR, Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: (i) an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the waste; (ii) an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and (iii) an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this section needs to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. This notification requirement does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to section 154-214(d).
(b)
Users are exempt from the requirements of subparagraph (a) of this section above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous wastes do not require additional notification.
(c)
In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the commissioner, the state hazardous waste authorities, and the regional waste management division director of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective data of such regulations.
(d)
In the case of any such notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree determined to be economically practical.
(e)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, any permit issues thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

The commissioner may require or permit the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish that portion which does not enter the system.
(f)
Applicability of section. Where the commissioner determines that sewer service is available to any lot, parcel of land, premises, or facility, 60 days' notice will be given to the owner of such lot, parcel of land, premises, or facility directing connection to available sewer, and billing as provided in subparagraphs (a) through (e) above will thereafter be initiated unless an exemption is authorized as set forth in subparagraph (g) below.
(g)
Exemption authorized. The mayor or his designee is hereby authorized to waive 12 percent of the sewer service charges for those domestic customers in the city who make application for such waiver and who can show to the satisfaction of the commissioner by certification of a master plumber licensed in the City of Atlanta, that they are not connected to the city's water pollution control facilities. Said 12 percent constitutes that part of the sewer service charge imposed for the city's water pollution control facilities' operating costs that is directly associated with the treatment of wastewater.
The mayor is hereby authorized to waive the entire sewer service charge for those domestic customers in the city who make application for such waiver and who can show to the satisfaction of the commissioner by certification of a master plumber licensed in the city that they are not connected to the city's water pollution control facilities. This certification must state that the lowest floor of their residence which contains rest room facilities, cannot be served by gravity flow. The waiver, once granted, shall continue in force, unless revoked, until plumbing permits are issued by the city's plumbing inspector for connection to the sewer. Such waiver, when authorized by the mayor, shall become effective on the first day of the next billing cycle after the date of authorization. No waiver will be authorized if any portion of the residence is connected to the city's water pollution control facilities.
Sewer rates are hereby waived by 30 percent for domestic customers, aged 65 and older, with a maximum household income of $25,000.00 or less.

(a)
Established. All persons discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers shall be charged and assessed a surcharge, in addition to any sewer service charges, if these wastes have a concentration greater than the following:
(1)
A COD content of 500 mg/l as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with procedures prescribed in section 154-282, subparagraph (b).
(2)
A TSS content of 250 mg/l as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with procedures prescribed in sections 154-282, subparagraph (b).
(3)
A TKN content of 25 mg/l as determined by a laboratory analysis in accordance with procedures prescribed in section 154-282, subparagraph (b).
The amount of the surcharge, which is hereby charged and assessed against all persons discharging industrial wastewater into the public sewers, shall reflect the cost incurred by the city in handling the excess COD, TKN, and TSS. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of charges for maintenance and operation of the water pollution control facilities including depreciation and other incidental expenses.
(b)
Formula determining surcharge. When any or all the COD, TKN, and TSS of wastewater or waste accepted for admission to the city water pollution control facilities exceed values of these constituents set forth in subparagraph (a) hereof, the excess concentrations of any or all, as the case may be, shall be evaluated in terms of these values and be subject to a surcharge on the amount derived in accordance with the following formula: Amount of surcharge = (B + C + D) × effluent flow (CCF)
Where:
EXPAND
B = The cost factor for TSS discharged to the sewer above 250 mg/l. This quantity is determined by the multiplication of a factor herein called "X", by the excessive pounds of TSS in the wastewater as measured in samples collected so as to be representative of the daily wastewater discharge.
C = The cost factor for COD discharged to the sewer above 500 mg/l. This quantity is determined by the multiplication of a factor herein called "Y", by the excessive pounds of COD in the wastewater as measured in samples collected so as to be representative of the daily wastewater discharge.
D = The cost factor for TKN discharged to the sewer above 25 mg/l. This quantity is determined by the multiplication of a factor herein called "Z", by the excessive pounds of TKN in the wastewater as measured in samples collected so as to be representative of the daily wastewater discharge.
X = The annual average cost of removal of one pound of TSS.
Y = The annual average cost of removal of one pound of COD.
Z = The annual average cost of removal of one pound of TKN.
  (c)
Determination of amounts. The rates of surcharge for each of the aforementioned constituents shall be determined annually by the commissioner in order that the above factors may correctly represent current treatment costs. A schedule of the surcharge shall be filed with the municipal clerk by the commissioner.
(d)
Changing industrial wastewater surcharge. The industrial waste surcharge cost factors shall not be increased in any year by more than 20 percent of the charges for the preceding year without written approval of the city council.

(Flow rates shall be calculated based on a two minute drainage period)
EXPAND
Steps Formula Example
1 Determine cubic content of fixture by multiplying length width × depth A sink 48" length by 24" wide by 12" deep. Cubic content 48 × 24 × 12 = 13,824 cubic inches.
2 Determine capacity in gallons.
1 gal. = 231 cubic inches Contents in gallons
13,824/231 = 59.8 gallons.
3 Determine actual drainage load. The fixture is normally filled to about 75% of capacity with water. The items being washed displace about 25% of the content, thus actual drainage load = 75% of fixture capacity 0.75 × 59.8 = 44.9 gallons.
>4 Determine flow rate and drainage period. In general, drainage period is the actual time required to completely drain the fixture. Flow rate = (Actual Drainage Load)/(Drainage Period) Flow rates shall be calculated on the basis of a two-minute drainage period.
Two-minute period 44.9/2 = 22.5 GPM flow rate.
5 Select indoor grease trap using the Following Table A1.2 for Sizing & Rating, which corresponds to the flow Rate, calculated.
Note: Select next larger size when flow rate falls between two sizes listed. For two-minute period:
22.5 GPM requires PDI size "25."

(4)
The "25 Percent Rule" requires that the depth of oil and grease (floating and settled) in a trap shall not be equal to or greater than 25 percent of the total operating depth of the trap. The operating depth of a trap is determined by measuring the internal depth from the outlet water elevation to the bottom of the trap. In application of this rule, the depth of floating oil and grease shall not be greater than 20 percent of total operating depth of a trap since five percent of the oil and grease is generally settled at the bottom of the trap.
(5)
The user shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal of the grease trap waste to a transporter and maintenance of records of disposal as specified in this section. All waste removed from each grease trap must be disposed of at an appropriate facility designed to receive such waste. In no manner shall any grease trap pumpage be discharged to the city's sewer collection or stormwater sewer system as otherwise prohibited in the sewer use ordinance.
Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floatable materials, wastewater, sludges, and solids. Top skimming of outdoor grease traps, decanting or back flushing of the grease trap or its wastes for the purpose of reducing the volume to be hauled is prohibited.
Further, the discharge of liquid, semi-solids, or solids into a grease trap from vehicles after servicing is prohibited. Vehicles capable of separating water from grease shall not discharge separated water into the grease trap or into the wastewater collection system.
Grease traps must be operated in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications and/or in accordance with generally accepted engineering standards and practices.
(6)
Record keeping requirement.

Once a grease trap fails an inspection, the inspector notifies the owner that the grease trap must be cleaned out within three days. After three days, the inspector will inspect the grease trap. If the grease trap is found to be in compliance, the inspector shall schedule the next inspection within 90 days for outside grease traps and 14 days for inside grease traps. If upon re-inspection the grease trap is found to be in compliance, the inspection schedule shall revert to that time period found on the food service establishment's permit.
Upon the re-inspection, if the grease trap is found to still be in violation, a notice of non-compliance will be issued and the grease trap user must clean the grease trap immediately.
Any grease trap, which receives three notices of non-compliance within a 24-month period, shall be deemed a nuisance by the commissioner of watershed management and shall require such corrections necessary to abate said nuisance.
Any mechanically operated grease trap found in non-compliance, shall be deemed a nuisance by the commissioner and must be upgraded to the new installations requirements of this section.
(c)
Notice of non-compliance. Whenever the commissioner discovers a violation of the "25 Percent Rule," or of the plans or specifications submitted and approved hereunder, or of a permit issued hereunder, a written notice or order shall be served by the commissioner upon the person responsible for directing discontinuance of such illegal action and the remedying of the condition that is in violation of the provisions of 154-297.03(b)(2) of this division.
(d)
Disregard of notice. If a person served with a notice or order to remove existing unsafe conditions from systems, appliances or equipment or discontinue the use of same, should fail within a reasonable time as set by the commissioner of watershed management to comply with the requirements thereof, the commissioner of watershed management shall institute an appropriate action in the courts to compel a compliance.
(e)
