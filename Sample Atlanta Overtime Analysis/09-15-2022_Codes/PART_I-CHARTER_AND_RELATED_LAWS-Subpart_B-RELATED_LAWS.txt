Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's noteâ€” Subpart B is a compilation of various local and special acts that were deemed to be of interest to the city. The source of each section is given in history notes. The location in session laws, when known, of ordinance amendments is indicated in tables following amended provisions. Section numbers and catchlines have been editorially supplied and internal references to other provisions have been altered so as to reference the compilation. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of citations to state statutes and session laws has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.
