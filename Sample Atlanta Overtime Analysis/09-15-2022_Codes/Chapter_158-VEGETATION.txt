Sec. 158-30. - Parking lot requirements.
The owner of any surface parking lot that is being built and/or resurfaced, and that will have a total of 30 or more parking spaces, whether primary or accessory in use, and whether commercial or noncommercial, must present a plan to the city arborist for approval, indicating that the parking lot will meet the minimum barrier curb and landscaping requirements as follows:
(1)
Barrier curbs shall be installed around the perimeter of the parking lot and around landscaped areas that are required in this article, except where the perimeter abuts an adjacent building or structure and at points of ingress and egress into the facility, so as to prevent encroachment of vehicles onto adjacent property, rights-of-way and landscaped areas.
(2)
Barrier curbs shall be a minimum of six inches in height and a minimum of eight inches in width and permanent in nature. Barrier curbs shall be concrete or stone. Such curbs shall be securely installed and maintained in good condition.
(3)
Where the end of a parking space abuts a landscaped area, barrier curbs may be placed in the parking space at a maximum of two feet from the end of the parking space. This two-foot wide area may have the pavement removed and be developed as part of the required landscaped area.
(4)
Surface parking lots shall have a minimum landscaped area equal to at least ten percent of the paved area within such lot. In no case shall a parking lot owner be required to provide landscaped areas that exceeds ten percent of the paved area. The director of the bureau of buildings, in consultation with the city arborist, shall have the authority to grant a variance from the requirements of this subsection if: the parking lot existed prior to 1977; and the director of the bureau of buildings finds that the applicant's circumstances meet the requirements set forth in subsection 158-30(15); and the director of the bureau of buildings finds that it is impossible to achieve the minimum landscaping requirement. For surface parking lots with fewer than 30 spaces, this variance may reduce or completely eliminate the amount of landscaped area required. For surface parking lots with 30 or greater spaces, this variance may reduce the landscaping requirement, but in no event shall the parking lot be permitted to have landscaped area that is less than ten percent of the paved area.
(5)
A minimum of one tree per eight parking spaces shall be included in the required landscaped areas. For the purpose of satisfying this requirement, existing trees that are two and one-half inches or more in caliper as measured at a height of 36 inches above ground level shall be considered to be equivalent to one or more newly planted trees on the basis of one tree for each two and one-half inches of caliper.
(6)

The tree conservation commission shall have the authority to determine when a person has violated any of the provisions of this article and shall have the authority to impose and enforce the fines described herein. Where the tree conservation commission is able to determine the exact number of trees upon which a tree protection ordinance violation occurred, a fine imposed for the first violation shall be no less than $500.00, and the fine imposed for each subsequent violation shall be $1,000.00. Each tree upon which a violation occurred shall be deemed a separate violation of the tree protection ordinance. Where the tree conservation commission is unable to determine the exact number of trees upon which a tree protection ordinance violation occurred, the commission shall assume a density of 1,000 inches DBH of trees per acre, and specifically shall assume that the lot contains 60 trees of 16.67 inches DBH per acre, and shall impose a fine of $60,000.00 per acre of land where the offense(s) occurred. Where the subject property is smaller than one acre, the fine shall be pro rated. Each day's continuance of a violation may be considered a separate offense. The owner of any building, structure or site, or part thereof, where anything in violation of this article exists, and any architect, builder, contractor or agent of the owner, or any tenant who commits or assists in the commission of any violation of this article shall be guilty of a separate offense.
(b)
In addition to paying the penalties set forth in subsection (a) above, any tree of six inches or larger DBH except pines, or any pine tree of 12 inches DBH or larger, that is removed or destroyed in violation of this article shall be replaced or recompensed by the violator, as set forth in section 158-103.

No activity, including construction material storage, shall occur in areas protected by tree fences. Tree protection fences must remain in place and upright until such time as final landscaping of a site requires their removal. The arborist may assess recompense against the violator if, in the arborist's opinion, the incursion has converted trees from the status of saved trees to the status of injured, lost, or destroyed trees, as set forth in this section above.
(d)
Additional actions and penalties. In addition to all other actions and penalties authorized in this section, the city attorney is authorized to institute injunctive, abatement or any other appropriate judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to prevent, enjoin, abate, or remove any violations of this section.

(c)
Frivolous appeals. An appeal may be dismissed as frivolous by a vote of the commission in advance of the time that would be set for hearing. In such instances, the members of the commission may be polled without meeting. An appeal is frivolous if it clearly appears from the face of the notice of the appeal and the justification set forth, that no facts could be brought forth at a hearing that could sustain such an appeal as a matter of law. In the event that an appeal is dismissed as frivolous, all parties shall be notified in writing by the clerk, and the clerk shall also give immediate notice by telephone, e-mail, or facsimile transmission to the appellant, advising the appellant of his or her right to appeal.

The property must contain one or more of the following, as determined by or at the direction of the department of parks and recreation commissioner and the department of city planning commissioner: i) 80 percent or more canopy cover; ii) minimum forestation standards of 1,000 DBH inches; and/or iii) 50 mature trees per acre.
(2)
The purchase of the forested property must be authorized by a duly-enacted city ordinance, and said ordinance shall include the following:
a.
The property must explicitly be dedicated and preserved in perpetuity as forested land;
b.
The property must be available for public use without cost (subject to Atlanta's park rules and other applicable city ordinances);
c.
Use of the property must be restricted to passive recreational activities with minimal environmental impact, as determined and established in writing by the department of parks and recreation commissioner based on the characteristics of the property; and
d.
The department of parks and recreation commissioner shall provide a property restoration and maintenance plan as an attachment to the ordinance. The plan will describe the types of restoration and maintenance that may be needed at the property, will estimate the property's annual restoration and maintenance cost, and will identify the source(s) of funding for the estimated annual restoration and maintenance cost. To the extent that the commissioner identifies the tree trust fund as one of the sources of funding, any specific allocation of dollars from the tree trust fund shall only be used for initial, short-term tree restoration and stabilization related to the protection, preservation and regeneration of trees on the property. This includes the removal of dead, dying or hazardous trees or invasive species that present a significant threat to the health of the trees, and staff or contractors to administer such services. This initial stabilization, clean-up and maintenance period shall not exceed three years from the purchase date of the property. Any expenses beyond three years after the purchase date shall be considered long-term maintenance costs and shall not be funded from the tree trust fund but rather from the operations and maintenance budget of the department of parks and recreation or a source other than the tree trust fund. No funds from the tree trust fund may be used for permanent infrastructure, including but not limited to the development or maintenance of roads, parking lots, trails, buildings or similar infrastructure, on the property.
Any allocation of maintenance dollars from the tree trust fund for any of these specified uses must be authorized as a separate procurement or expenditure, in a manner consistent with applicable city ordinances.
(3)
The department of parks and recreation commissioner and the department of city planning commissioner shall jointly develop a written list of factors and a process for evaluating parcels that may be suitable for acquisition as forested property. An ordinance authorizing procurement of forested property, as described in subsection 158-66(b)(2) above, shall include as attachments an affidavit from each of the two commissioners providing her/his recommendation regarding the procurement based upon these factors.
(4)
The department of parks commissioner and the department of city planning commissioner shall jointly provide a report to the community development/human resources committee each time a privately-owned afforested property procured by the city, which shall include the amount appropriated from the tree recompense fund and the acreage of the property.
(c)
Recompense for illegal removal or destruction. Developers, builders, contractors, homeowners and others who violate the criteria for removal or destruction of section 158-102 shall contribute to the fund the replacement value of the trees illegally removed or destroyed according to the recompense formulas of section 158-34.
(d)
Recompense for permitted removal or destruction. Developers, builders, contractors, homeowners and others who are unable to meet the standards for tree replacement and afforestation of section 158-103 shall contribute to the fund the replacement value of the trees removed in excess of the trees replaced in the course of new construction, landscaping, or other permitted activities according to the recompense formulas of subsections 158-103(b) and (c).

There has been no removal of a tree pursuant to this subsection 158-101(i) for five years from the date of an application previously approved pursuant to this subsection, unless the tree(s) previously permitted and removed was leaning by greater than 20 degrees, as measured at breast height of the tree, toward an existing single family residential dwelling structure or duplex located on the subject property. The five year time period between a previously approved application and a new application shall apply to the property and shall not be affected by any change of ownership or reconfiguration of the property boundaries. Any property which is combined with any part of any other property which has already removed a tree pursuant to this subsection within the five-year time period shall not be eligible for removal under this subsection. In the event that a lot with reconfigured property lines has received more than one approval under this subsection, the latest approved application shall be considered for deciding when a new application may be received.
(5)
No lot of record which is not developed with a single family residential structure or duplex within its property lines shall be granted a permit to remove a tree pursuant to this subsection regardless of whether the zoning of the property will only allow the development of single family residences or duplexes on the property.
(6)
When determining the distance of the tree from the structure, the tree shall be measured at the base of the tree, where the trunk of the tree meets the ground, on the side of the tree that is closest to the structure at issue.
(7)
When determining the location of the foundation of the structure at issue, any portion of the structure constructed on piers or pilings shall not be deemed to be part of the foundation.
(8)
No posting of the property is required prior to the issuance of a permit.
(9)
Only the property owner shall have appeal rights associated with the permit. such appeal rights shall be as set forth in section 158-65 of this article.
(10)
Where a permit is issued, the property owner shall not be required to replace the tree or pay recompense, except that where removal of the tree will result in the loss of ten percent or more of the tree canopy on the subject property, as determined by the city arborist, issuance of the permit shall be contingent upon the property owner's planting a replacement tree(s) on the subject property pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article.
(11)
Where a tree is removed without a permit, recompense and fines shall be calculated and owed as prescribed throughout the tree protection ordinance, even if the property would have been eligible for a tree removal permit pursuant to this subsection 158-101(i).
(12)
The city arborist shall not issue a permit if the tree at issue is located on property that was the subject of a violation of the tree protection ordinance within one year of the filing of the permit application.
(j)

a.
The city's department of watershed management has submitted an application to the city arborist in the department of city planning in a form prescribed by said city arborist.
b.
For trees located within a city easement that are not boundary trees, the department of watershed management may destroy, remove and/or injure trees as prescribed in section 158-103(c)(6) of this tree protection ordinance, except that the number of trees to be destroyed, removed and/or injured may be determined by acre rather than by tree per tree or sampling techniques, and except that specimen trees need not be identified. A maximum shall be set on recompense at $5,000.00 per acre, prorated. A site plan drawn to scale shall be required for these trees showing locations impacted by acre, but not showing individually impacted trees. No survey shall be required. For purposes of this section 158-101(j), the city shall be deemed to have an easement on land above city sewer lines.
c.
The department of watershed management shall submit a site plan that meets the standards set forth in 158-105 of the tree protection ordinance for: 1) destruction or removal of or injury to a boundary tree located on a city easement whose subject boundary abuts private property or public property; or 2) destruction or removal of or injury to a boundary tree whose structural root plate extends from private property or public property into the city easement; and 3) destruction or removal of or injury to all other private property trees. This site plan must include each tree's critical root zone, structural root plate, whether it's a boundary tree, silvicultural prescriptions to be used if applicable, and the construction methodology to be utilized by location. It shall also provide a calculation of the percentage of impact on each tree that is not removed. A survey shall be required showing all impacted trees falling within this category, though the survey may be performed by GPS coordinates, via a sketch describing each tree and showing its DBH. The sketch need not be performed by a registered surveyor or landscape architect. The application shall include recompense calculations, and proposed plantings of new trees. The city shall give recompense credit to the department of watershed management for newly planted trees only if the replanting requirements set forth in the tree protection ordinance are met (other than those requirements set forth in subsections 158-101(b) through 158-101(i)), but shall not give any recompense credit for new trees planted within the city's easement.

The tree is located in that portion of the setback or required yard area of the lot that must be used for vehicular ingress and egress or for the installation of utilities that cannot be accomplished in a manner allowing preservation of the tree;
c.
The tree is diseased or injured to the extent that death is imminent within two years, or is in imminent danger of falling, or is so close to existing or proposed buildings so as to endanger them, or physically interferes with utility services in a manner that cannot be corrected by anything less than destruction or removal of the tree, or creates unsafe vehicular visual clearance, or is otherwise deemed a hazard by the city arborist or city forester;
d.
The tree removal qualifies for a permit pursuant to section 158-101(i) or section 158-101(j).
(b)
The following species of trees, if 12 inches or smaller DBH and located on private property, are exempt from the posting, replacement, and recompense portions of this article, and from section 158-102(a)(3) of this article whereby a property owner may remove the tree located on her/his property without posting, replacing the tree or paying recompense: Mimosa - Albizia julibrissin; Tree of heaven - Ailanthus altissima; White mulberry - Morus alba; Paper mulberry - Broussonetia papyrifera; Chinaberry - Melia azederach; Princess tree - Paulownia tomentosa; Carolina cherry laurel - Prunus caroliniana; Bradford Pear - Pyrus calleryana; Leyland cypress -x Cupressocyparis leylandii. Where such species of tree is larger than 12 inches DBH and located on private property, the property owner need not post the tree, and need only replace the tree or pay recompense if the tree cover on the lot from which the tree is removed is less than the minimum tree cover per zoning district, as set forth in section 158-103(g). Removal of trees of one of the above-listed species, where the tree is six inches DBH or larger, requires the homeowner to apply for and receive a permit from the office of buildings, and said application must include:
(1)
At least two pictures of the tree at issue that identify the species of tree; and
(2)
A site plan showing the appropriate zoning information of the property; and
(3)
A tree survey including but not limited to location, quantity, types and DBH, prepared by ISA certified arborists or landscape architects.
(Code 1977, § 10-2037(d); Ord. No. 2001-102, § 2, 12-11-01; Ord. No. 2003-03, §§ 1, 2, 1-13-03; Ord. No. 2006-04, § 1, 2-14-06; Ord. No. 2007-32(07-O-0362), §§ 10, 18, 6-12-07; Ord. No. 2009-13 (09-O-0399), § 3, 3-24-09)
Sec. 158-103. - Standards for tree replacement and afforestation.
(a)
Minimal impact on trees; replacement trees. Each applicant for a permit to remove, destroy or injure trees shall, to the maximum extent feasible, minimize the impact on the trees on the site. The applicant shall plant replacement trees on site that equal the total number of trees being removed, destroyed, or injured, provided that where the removed, destroyed or injured trees were located on public property, the cumulative DBH of the replacement trees shall be equal to or greater than the cumulative DBH of the trees removed, destroyed and/or injured. Where construction of improvements or existing dense tree cover precludes the planting of the total number of replacement trees required on the site, the city arborist may approve a plan which results in the planting of the number of trees on the site which can reasonably be expected to be accommodated in a manner which will allow mature growth of the replacement trees. The remainder of the total number of trees may be planted in a local park, on public lands, or along right-of-ways, subject to approval of the City of Atlanta Parks Department, provided such plantings are within the same NPU district or within one mile of the NPU boundary.
(1)
Where appropriate site conditions exist, replacement trees shall be overstory or mid-canopy species. Understory trees shall be permitted where site conditions do not allow the planting of overstory or mid-canopy trees. Overstory trees shall be planted at a minimum 35 feet on center. Mid-canopy trees shall be planted at a minimum 25 feet on center. Understory trees shall be planted at a minimum 15 feet on center. Certain columnar species used primarily for screening may be accepted for partial recompense in accord with the planting distance established for understory trees.
(2)
The following species of trees may not be used as replacement trees: Mimosa - Albizia julibrissin; Tree of heaven - Ailanthus altissima; White mulberry - Morus alba; Paper mulberry - Broussonetia papyrifera; Chinaberry - Melia azederach; Princess tree - Paulownia tomentosa; Carolina cherry laurel - Prunus caroliniana; Bradford Pear - Pyrus calleryana; Leyland cypress -x Cupressocyparis leylandii. In addition, no recompense credit shall be provided for the planting of said species of trees.
(b)
Recompense. The difference between the number of trees removed, destroyed or injured (Nrem) and the number of trees replaced (Nrep) on a site times the established recompense value shall be calculated as partial recompense to the tree trust fund. In addition, the difference between the total diameter at breast height of the trees removed or destroyed (TDBHrem) and the total caliper inches of the trees replaced on site (TCIrep), as indicated on the approved tree replacement plan, shall be calculated as partial recompense to the tree trust fund. Total recompense(R) shall be calculated according to the formula
R = $100.00 (Nrem - Nrep) + $30.00 (TDBHrem - TCIrep), C >=0
(c)
Limits and adjustments.
(1)
For recompense purposes of this section, all trees except pines with a minimum DBH of six inches shall be included in the formula. Pines with a minimum DBH of 12 inches shall be included in the formula.
(2)
For new subdivisions, new lots of record, and vacant lots, a maximum shall be set on recompense at a pro rated per acre basis by zoning classification as tabulated below, provided that no less than the specified minimum of existing trees, by total DBH inches, are retained on a site. Credit based on the established recompense value formula will be given for trees planted. This credit may be subtracted from maximum recompense per acre, provided trees are spaced at no more than one tree per 400 square feet.

  *Vacant lots shall be based upon the lower Minimum Trees Retained total DBH inches, new subdivisions and new lots of record shall be based upon the higher Minimum Trees Retained total DBH inches.
**Where an underlying zoning category does not apply, the Minimum Trees Retained (MTR) for planned developments shall be derived by multiplying the required percentage of the site required to be retained in pervious area by a factor of .60 which will establish the Minimum Trees Retained percentage (MTR%). This amount shall be calculated according to the formula:
Required Pervious Area (K) x .60 = MTR%
Maximum Recompense Per Acre = $10,000.00
(3)
Provided that no less then the specified minimum of existing trees, by total DBH, are retained on a site in accordance with Table 158-103 then the maximum recompense per acre may be further reduced by the replanting of new trees. Adjusted maximum recompense per acre (AMRPA) shall be calculated according to the formula:
Reduction from MRPA = $100.00 (Nrep) + $30.00 (TCIrep)
AMRPA = MRPA - Reduction from MRPA
(4)
For sales housing units which have a pro-forma sales price equal to or less than 1.5 times median family income as defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the percent of minimum trees retained may be reduced to 50 percent of the above percentage values in order to qualify for maximum recompense per acre.
(5)
For sales housing units which have a pro-forma sales price greater than one and one-half times median family income but not exceeding two and one-half times median family income as defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the percent of minimum trees retained may be reduced to 75 percent of the above percentage values in order to qualify for maximum recompense per acre.
(6)
For trees removed in the required construction of streets and related infrastructure in new subdivisions or other planned developments, a maximum shall be set on recompense at $5,000.00 per acre, pro rated. Credit based on the established recompense value formula shall be given for trees planted. This credit may be subtracted from maximum recompense per acre, provided trees are spaced at no more than one tree per 400 square feet. For infrastructure development that requires disturbance of one acre or more, a recognized sampling technique performed and certified by a registered forester may be substituted for an actual count of the trees to be removed. All specimen trees must be identified by species and location regardless of the counting procedure adopted.
(7)
Conservation easements [and fee simple donations] (section 158-32) that result in the preservation of wooded lands, or newly created wooded parkland afforested to 100 inches DBH per acre, and that are perpetual in duration shall receive a credit of $20,000.00 per acre, pro rated, against recompense fees. Natural water detention areas established in lieu of the construction of detention ponds shall qualify as conservation easements if so deeded as a conservation easement. In addition, a fee simple donation of land that is afforested to 100 inches DBH per acre, and that is accepted by the city, will receive a credit of $20,000.00 per acre, pro rated, against recompense fees, but only if the city dedicates the land for a use that will preserve the land in its natural scenic landscape or in a forest use.
(8)
For rental housing units that have at least 20 percent of the total number of residential units constructed being within the ability to pay of those households whose annual incomes do not exceed 60 percent of the median family income for the Atlanta metropolitan statistical area, the percent of minimum trees retained may be reduced to 50 percent of the above percentage values in order to qualify for maximum recompense per acre.
(d)
An impacted tree will not be considered destroyed and will not be charged recompense only if all the following are met:
(1)
Tree save fencing is established and maintained to protect at least 67 percent of the root save area, and the structural root plate is not disturbed.
(2)
An ISA certified arborist or registered forester is retained to prescribe and monitor the implementation of measures to maximize the survival and protection of the tree, including but not limited to root pruning, canopy pruning, mulching, watering, fertilization, and enhanced protective fencing.
(3)
The prescription of the retained arborist is approved by the city arborist or city forester in advance of construction.
(4)
A report on the effectiveness of the prescribed measures is submitted by the retained arborist to the city arborist or city forester prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(e)
A lost tree shall be charged recompense regardless of whether or not it is removed from the site.
(f)
The city arborist shall prepare a quarterly report to be presented to the tree conservation commission. The report shall include the total number and DBH of trees removed and/or the total number and DBH of trees replanted during the preceding quarter in each of the following categories: maximum recompense per acre, dead/dying/diseased/hazardous removal, landscaping permit, silvicultural removal, buildable area removal, parking lots, illegal removal, off-site planting, or any other permit or penalty category not listed. The report shall also include acreage, total number of trees and total DBH for any newly created conservation easements or newly created parklands.
(g)
Minimum tree cover. In any request for a permit for construction in which no trees are proposed to be removed, or in cases where trees are being removed but the total tree cover on the lot is less than the minimum tree cover per zoning district, the city arborist shall require an afforestation standard such that the minimum tree cover per zoning district is satisfied, provided that all such trees so planted can reasonably be expected to be accommodated in a manner which will allow mature growth of the new trees.
Tree replacements per zoning district and the minimum required tree coverage (TDBH + TCI) on a site, regardless of any loss of trees, are as follows:
R-5, R-4-A and R-4-B districts: 35 inches per acre
R-3, R-3-A and R-4 districts: 40 inches per acre
R-2 and R-2-A districts: 100 inches per acre
R-1 districts: 150 inches per acre
RG, PD and all other districts: 90 inches per acre
Replacement trees shall be a minimum of two and one-half inches in caliper. Regardless of caliper or diameter at breast height, replacement trees shall not subsequently be removed or destroyed without a permit from the city arborist.
(h)
Planting priority. The location of tree plantings required by this section normally shall be prioritized as follows:
(1)
Heat islands. Streets and other external heat islands shall be shaded by new or existing trees at a spacing not to exceed 35 feet on center on average, with a minimum of two trees per lot when feasible. Street trees shall be planted as close to the street as is practicable. Internal heat islands shall be shaded at a minimum rate of one tree per 750 square feet of heat island area.
(2)
Soil stabilization. Replacement trees shall next be planted on steep slopes and other erodible areas and on the banks of wetlands and waterways.
(3)
Following satisfaction of priorities (1) and (2), the applicant shall have discretion to satisfy additional tree planting requirements either by planting on the subject site, on another location approved by the city arborist, or by contributing the appropriate amount to the tree trust fund.

Sec. 158-104. - Protection of trees.
(a)
The city arborist shall require that improvements be located so as to result the protection of the trees on the site. It is the specific intent of this section to require that damage to trees located within the setback and required yard areas and to trees located on abutting properties owned by others be minimized to the greatest degree possible under the particular circumstances, as determined by the city arborist according to the following guidelines:
(1)
On lots and subdivisions of one acre or more, the applicant shall identify environmentally sensitive areas as part of the site plan required in section 158-105 below. Such areas shall include wetlands, floodplains, permanent and intermittent streams, stands of trees and other significant aspects of the natural environment on site. Limits of disturbance to these areas shall be established and detailed on the site plan. In order to protect the more environmentally sensitive areas, development shall be confined to the portion of the lot required for the intended construction.
(2)
On lots and subdivisions of less than one acre, root save areas shall be established in the setback and required yard areas to preserve trees in those areas. Grading, trenching, or other land disturbance in these areas shall be limited to necessary hydrologic and erosion control measures and access corridors to streets, utility connections, or other features required by code. In order to protect the trees in the setback and required yard areas, building shall be confined to the portion of the lot required for the intended construction.
(3)
A maximum of ten percent of the trees in a designated wetland or 100-year floodplain may be approved for removal or destruction.

Sec. 158-105. - Site plan required.
(a)
General requirements. The site plan shall include a tree survey identifying the size, species and location of all trees having a diameter at breast height (DBH) of six inches or greater. Such site plan shall contain topographic information at two-foot contour intervals and shall show all existing and proposed buildings and structures, driveways and parking areas, drainage structures, water detention areas, utilities, construction material staging grounds and all areas of required cut and fill. Single family lots of record may be exempt from the requirement of the topographic survey provided that no grading or cut or fill or other changes in topography will occur. Such plan shall denote each tree to be saved, lost or destroyed, the percentage of root save area that will be impacted, the required tree protection fences for trees to be saved, and the proposed tree replacement plan. The proposed tree replacement plan shall set forth the manner in which the newly planted trees will be watered, for example, manually, drip irrigation, Gator bags, etc. In addition, the proposed tree replacement plan shall have attached a copy of a paid maintenance contract if applicable. Pines of less than 12 inches DBH are exempted from being denoted on the tree survey. A construction limit line shall be delineated on each site plan submitted for a building permit. Within the construction limit line, the tree replacement requirements of this article shall be shown. Outside this limit line, no tree survey shall be required, and the applicant shall be required to leave undisturbed all areas of trees.
(b)
Boundary trees. Boundary trees shall be included in the site plan. The on-site portion of the root save area of a boundary tree shall be enclosed in a tree protection fence according to established arboricultural standards. In consultation with the owner or owner's representative of a boundary tree, the city arborist may prescribe and the applicant shall institute additional protective measures to limit impact on the tree during construction, including but not limited to watering regimes, root treatments, mulching, deadwood removal and protective pruning.

Sec. 158-109. - Exemptions.
The following are exempted from the terms of this article:
(1)
When the parks arboricultural manager or city arborist finds any tree to present hazard or danger to the health, safety and welfare of the public, such tree may be removed immediately by the owner or the owner's agent upon verbal authorization by the parks arboricultural manager or city arborist. Any property owner or resident who reasonably believes and can demonstrate that a tree on her/his property presents imminent hazard or danger to the health, safety and welfare of the public, may contact the city arborist or her/his designee by phone to inform the city arborist of the emergency. Based upon the information provided by phone, the city arborist or her/his designee may give verbal approval of the tree's removal. Within five working days of said approval, the owner, resident, or her/his agent must provide to the department of city planning 's arborist division photos of the tree at issue along with a tree removal application. Failure to follow these procedures may result in an assessment of recompense and fines. In addition, should the photos and application, and any other information obtained by the city arborist, cause the city arborist to find that the tree did not present imminent hazard or danger, the city arborist shall assess recompense and may impose a fine. Should the emergency be identified by the property owner or resident during non-working hours, s/he may remove the tree immediately, but must contact the city arborist or her/his designee during the next working day to discuss the emergency, and must submit the information described above within five working days of the tree's removal. The owner and/or resident may be subject to recompense and fines under the circumstances described above in this subsection. No permit is required.
(2)
During the period of any emergency, such as a tornado, ice storm, flood or an other act of nature, the requirements of this article may be waived by the mayor and the mayor's designee.
(3)
All licensed plant or tree nurseries and tree farms shall be exempt from the terms and provisions of this article only in relation to those trees which are planted and are being grown for sale or intended sale to the general public in the ordinary course of business, or for some public purpose. All licensed tree museums or public botanical gardens which employ a full-time arborist or horticulturist, and which are located upon property owned by the city and leased to such tree museums or botanical gardens and are growing for display to the public in furtherance of the museums and botanical gardens, or for some other public purpose.

Sec. 158-110. - Dead or diseased trees; nuisances.
The provisions of this section shall apply to all property in the city, as follows:
(1)
Generally. Any dead or diseased tree or part of a tree is a nuisance when, by reason of such condition, natural forces may, more readily than if such tree or part thereof were live or not diseased, fell or blow such tree or part thereof onto public ways or public property, off of the property of the owner of such tree, and thereby imperil life or property or impede traffic. When a dead or diseased tree which is alleged to constitute a nuisance is brought to the attention of the parks arboricultural manager or city arborist, the parks arboricultural manager or city arborist, in their discretion, may submit through the director, bureau of parks a written opinion to the director, bureau of buildings. Upon receiving a written opinion from the director, bureau of parks that any tree or part thereof is a nuisance as defined in this section, the director, bureau of buildings shall commence nuisance abatement proceedings.
(2)
Notice to owner to remedy conditions; failure to comply. The director, bureau of buildings shall give written notice to the owner or the person in possession, charge or control of the property where a tree nuisance as defined in this section exists, stating that in the city arborist's opinion the tree or part of a tree does constitute a nuisance that shall be removed, and requesting that such removal be done within a reasonable time to be specified in such notice. In no event shall such reasonable time exceed ten working days. Such notice shall further state that unless the tree or part thereof is voluntarily removed within the time specified, the director may cause summons to be issued requiring the party notified to appear in the municipal court to have there determined whether the tree or part of a tree involved constitute a nuisance and should be abated. If the tree is not removed within the time specified by the director, the director may cause the owner of such tree, or the person in possession, charge or control thereof, to be summoned to appear before the judge of the municipal court to determine whether or not the tree or part of a tree involved constitutes a nuisance.
(3)
Hearing; failure to comply with order to abate. If upon such a hearing as provided for before the judge of the municipal court, the judge shall find that the tree or part of a tree constitutes a nuisance and orders the defendant to abate the same within a specified time, then each ten days that the conditions adjudicated to be a nuisance by the judge are maintained subsequent to the expiration of the time fixed in the judgment of the judge the same to be abated shall constitute an offense.
(4)
Emergencies. Such nuisance trees pose immediate hazards and, because of the imminence of danger, are too great a risk to leave standing while standard procedures for giving notice take place. In such cases where danger to the public is imminent, the director of the office of parks shall have the right, but not the obligation, to enter the property and abate the nuisance, and the reasonable costs of such work, as documented by the office of parks, shall be reimbursed by the department of city planning . The department of city planning shall have the authority to obtain reimbursement from the property owner.
