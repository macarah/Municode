Editor's note— Ord. No. 2003-108, § 2(Exh. A), approved Dec. 9, 2003, amended ch. 75 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, said chapter pertained to similar subject matter as enacted by Ord. No. 2003-93, § 2(Exh. A), approved May 27, 2003.

Sec. 75-1. - Policy.
(a)
The City of Atlanta shall integrate green and/or sustainable building principles and practices into the design, construction, and operations of all city facilities, and city-funded projects to the fullest extent possible and at minimum to the extent described in section 75-19. Furthermore, the city shall provide leadership and guidance to encourage the application of green building practices in private sector development. This policy is expected to yield long-term cost savings to the city's taxpayers due to substantial improvements in life-cycle performance and reduced life-cycle costs.
(b)
In addition, the city shall evaluate all land purchases for future development on the basis of reducing environmental impacts that include but are not limited to transit, pedestrian and bicycle accessibility, urban and brown fields redevelopment, on-site stormwater mitigation capacity, vegetation and habitat restoration, and renewable energy opportunities.

Secs. 75-2—75-15. - Reserved.
Sec. 75-16. - Purpose.
The purpose of the City of Atlanta's policy on sustainable building is to require the city's commitment to environmental, economic, and social stewardship, to yield cost savings to the city taxpayers through reduced operating costs, to provide healthy and productive work environments for staff and visitors, and to contribute to the city's goals of protecting, conserving, and enhancing the region's environmental resources. Additionally, the city shall help to set a community standard of sustainable building.

Sec. 75-18. - Definitions.
Sustainable building: Sustainable building means the integration of building materials and methods that promote environmental quality, economic vitality, and social benefit through the integrated design, construction and operation of the built environment. Sustainable building merges sound, environmentally responsible practices into one discipline that looks at the environmental, economic and social effects of a building or built project as a whole. Sustainable design encompasses the following broad topics: energy use, water use, indoor environmental quality, materials selection, stormwater infiltration and the building energy management.
Life cycle cost analysis: An inclusive approach to costing a program, facility, or group of facilities that encompasses planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance over the useful life of the facilities and finally any decommissioning or disassembly costs. Life cycle cost analysis looks at the net present value of design options as investments. The goal is to achieve the highest, most cost-effective environmental performance possible over the life of the project.
LEEDTMrating system: LEED TM stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, and is a voluntary, consensus-based, market-driven green building rating system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). It is based on existing, proven technology and evaluates environmental performance from a "whole building" perspective. LEED TM is a third-party certifying system designed for rating new and existing commercial, institutional, and multi- family residential buildings.
Renovation: Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement of a property, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the property before the improvement or repair is started.
(Ord. No. 2003-108, § 2(Exh. A), 12-9-03; Ord. No. 2017-42(17-O-1218), § 2, 7-26-17 )
Sec. 75-19. - Policy and goals.
(a)
It is the policy of the City of Atlanta to finance, plan, design, construct, manage, renovate, maintain, and decommission its facilities and buildings using sustainable practices and means. This applies to new construction and renovations in which the total project square footage includes at least 5,000 gross square feet of occupied space.
(b)
The LEED TM rating system and Reference Guide shall be used as a guidance for design and as a measuring tool to determine what constitutes sustainable building by national standards.
(c)
Facilities and buildings over 5,000 gross square feet of occupied space shall at a minimum incorporate sustainable design criterion as defined by this article. Design and project management teams are required to achieve LEED TM Silver Certification.
(d)
At the time facilities are required to be audited and comply with retro commissioning requirements per Part 8, Chapter 2, Article J of the City's Land Development Code, Part III of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, facilities shall obtain LEED TM Existing Buildings: Operation & Maintenance or the most recent equivalent.
