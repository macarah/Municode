(a)
Purpose: The council finds that many buildings, sites and districts, as herein defined, having a special character or a special historic or aesthetic interest or value, or representing the finest architectural products of distinct periods in the history of the city have been destroyed or uprooted, notwithstanding the feasibility of preserving and continuing the use of such buildings, sites and districts, and without adequate consideration of the irreplaceable loss to the people of the city of the aesthetic, educational, economic and historic values represented by such buildings, sites and districts.

It is the finding of the council that the standing of this city as the capital of government, culture, business and education and as a major tourist and convention center must be maintained and enhanced by preserving the historical and architectural heritage of the city and by preventing the destruction of such cultural assets. The council further finds that certain aspects of development, such as the spatial relationships of structures and open spaces to each other and the appearance of buildings and open spaces as they contribute to the attractiveness, function, and character of a district or of the city as a whole, require the timely exercise of judgment in the public interest by a public body qualified to evaluate the design of proposed new developments or redevelopments within the city.

It is further declared as a matter of public policy that the promotion of sound urban design principles in order to provide a built environment which is attractive and functional is a public necessity and is required in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety, education and general welfare of the people. Accordingly, the public policy objectives of this article are as follows:
(1)
To effect and accomplish the protection, enhancement and perpetuation of such buildings, sites and districts which represent or reflect special elements of the city's cultural, social, economic and architectural history;
(2)

(3)
To stabilize and improve property values in such buildings, sites and districts;
