(d)
Retirement Plan -Defined Benefit Component.
(1)
The DB Plans, as defined in Section 6-2(a)(10) above, shall remain in effect. This Section 6-2 does not create new DB Plans, but rather modifies the DB Plans already in existence.
(2)
Beginning on November 1, 2011, each DB Plan Participant hired prior to that date shall contribute 12% of her/his Compensation to the applicable DB Plan if s/he does not have a designated beneficiary, and shall contribute 13% of her/his Compensation to the applicable DB Plan if s/he does have a designated beneficiary, except that DB Plan Participants who choose to participate in the DB Hybrid Option shall make the contributions and receive the benefits described in Section 6-2(g) below.
(3)
Each DB Plan Participant hired after September 1, 2011 shall contribute 8% of her/his Compensation to the applicable DB Plan.
(4)
Except as set forth in Section 6-2(d)(6) and 6-2(g) below, the calculation of an Employee's Pension Benefit shall be the same as the calculation applied by the City in 2011, prior to November 1. Specifically, calculation of a Pension Benefit shall be as follows (elements of the calculation not addressed in this Section 6-2 shall be implemented as set forth in the applicable DB Plan):
(i)
The DB Plan Benefit Formula ("Benefit Formula") is derived as follows:
(A)
The pension multiplier set forth in the applicable DB Plan, ranging from 1%—3% (the "Multiplier"), is multiplied by the Employee's years of service with the City ("Years of Service") (the product shall be referred to as "Years of Service Multiplier").
(B)
The Years of Service Multiplier may not exceed 80% (the "Cap"), unless the Employee opted for a Benefit Formula that waives the Cap. If the Years of Service Multiplier exceeds 80%, the Years of Service Multiplier shall be reduced to 80% ("Adjusted Years of Service Multiplier"), except that if the Employee opted to waive the Cap, the Years of Service Multiplier shall remain unchanged (also referred to as the "Adjusted Years of Service Multiplier").
(C)
The Adjusted Years of Service Multiplier shall be multiplied by Annual Compensation. Annual Compensation is determined by calculating the highest Compensation received by an Employee over a consecutive 36 month period and dividing it by three ("Annual Compensation").
(D)
The Benefit Formula is increased by applying the Employee's unused annual leave and unused sick leave at the time of retirement. Annual leave is utilized to increase the value of Annual Compensation in the Benefit Formula. Sick leave is utilized to increase the value of Years of Service in the Benefit Formula and also to increase Annual Compensation under certain circumstances. The details of determining the value of the unused leave and how it impacts the Benefit Formula is set forth in the applicable DB Plan.
(E)
In the form of a numerical equation, the Benefit Formula for Employees whose Benefit Formula has a Cap is:
Benefit Formula= Annual Compensation x {lower of: 80% or (Multiplier x Years of Service)}
The Benefit Formula for Employees whose Benefit Formula does not have a Cap is:
Benefit Formula = Annual Compensation x Multiplier x Years of Service
(F)
The Cost of Living Adjustment shall be calculated as set forth in the applicable DB Plan.
(ii)
The actual benefit received by the Employee ("Actual Benefit") shall be equivalent to the Benefit Formula, unless the Employee is not fully vested in the DB Plan, or unless the Employee collects her/his DB pension prior to reaching Retirement Age or Thirty Years of Service. Calculation of the Actual Benefit prior to vesting and/or prior to reaching Retirement Age or Thirty Years of Service shall be as follows:
(A)
If a DB Plan Participant is fully vested in the DB Plan and collects her/his DB pension prior to reaching Retirement Age or Thirty Years of Service, the Benefit Formula shall be reduced by the Age Penalty amount set forth in the applicable DB Plan.
(B)
If a DB Plan Participant has completed at least 5 Years of Service with the City but has not fully vested in the DB Plan, and leaves City employment prior to reaching Retirement Age or Thirty Years of Service, the Employee may elect not to receive her/his pension until Retirement Age or later. Employees hired prior to July 1, 2010 shall be fully vested upon the completion of ten Years of Service. Employees hired on and after July 1, 2010 shall be fully vested upon the completion of fifteen Years of Service. At the time that the DB Plan Participant files a completed application with the City to receive pension (assuming s/he has reached Retirement Age), s/he will be provided a monthly pension benefit equivalent to the Benefit Formula multiplied by the Vesting Percentage. The Vesting Percentages are as follows:
1.
Completion of 5 Years of Service - 25%;
2.
Completion of 6 Years of Service - 30%;
3.
Completion of 7 Years of Service - 35%;
4.
Completion of 8 Years of Service - 40%;
5.
Completion of 9 Years of Service - 45%.
6.
For DB Plan Participants who require 10 Years of Service to fully vest, the Vesting Percentage will be 100% after the completion of 10 Years of Service.
7.
For DB Plan Participants who require 15 Years of Service to fully vest, Completion of 10 Years of Service - 50%.
8.
Completion of 11 Years of Service - 55%.
9.
Completion of 12 Years of Service - 60%.
10.
Completion of 13 Years of Service - 65%.
11.
Completion of 14 Years of Service - 70%.
12.
For DB Plan Participants who require 15 Years of Service to fully vest, the Vesting Percentage will be 100% after the completion of 15 Years of Service.
(C)
It a DB Plan Participant is not fully vested in the DB Plan and leaves City employment prior to completion of 5 Years of Service, the Employee shall receive a cash-out value for her/his pension contributions equivalent to the amount s/he contributed into the DB Plan plus 5% per annum for the number of years in which s/he contributed to the DB Plan, subject to IRC Section 401(a)(31)(B).
(D)
In the form of a numerical equation, the Actual Benefit for DB Plan Participants who are vested and retire prior to reaching Retirement Age or Thirty Years of Service is:
Actual Benefit = Benefit Formula - Age Penalty
The Actual Benefit for DB Plan Participants who have 5 or more years of service and draw their pension at Retirement Age or later is:
Actual Benefit = Benefit Formula × Vesting Percentage
(5)
The Pension Benefit calculation for a DB Plan Participant hired prior to September 1, 2011 shall be as set forth in Section 6-2(d)(4) above, except that the calculation for a DB Hybrid Participant shall be as set forth in Section 6-2(g) below.
(6)
For DB Plan Participants hired on or after September 1, 2011 only, the Pension Benefit shall be as set forth in Section 6-2(d)(4) above, except for the following changes:
(i)
The Multiplier in the Benefit Formula shall be 1%.
(ii)
The value of Annual Compensation in the Benefit Formula shall be calculated based upon the highest Compensation received by an Employee over a consecutive 120 month period. The Compensation amount may be increased by adding the value of unused annual leave as described in the applicable DB Plan.
(iii)
Unused sick leave may not be utilized to change any portion of the Benefit Formula or Actual Benefit.
(iv)
The Cost of Living Adjustment for Post-Change Pension Benefits shall be a maximum amount of 1%.
(v)
The Retirement Age for the Firefighters' Pension Plan or Police Officers' Pension Plan shall be 57 years of age or older. The Retirement Age for the General Employees' Pension Plan shall be 62 years of age or older.
(vi)
The age penalty assessed for DB Plan Participants who retire prior to Retirement Age shall be 6% per year (or 0.5% per month). A DB Plan Participant in the Firefighters' Pension Plan or Police Officers' Pension Plan may not collect her/his pension prior to reaching 47 years of age, unless s/he has attained Thirty Years of Service. A DB Plan Participant in the General Employees' Pension Plan may not collect her/his pension prior to reaching 52 years of age, unless s/he has attained Thirty Years of Service. Nothing in this provision shall prevent a DB Plan Participant from obtaining a cash-out value for her/his pension contributions at any time, and such value shall be equivalent to the amount s/he contributed into the DB Plan plus 5% per annum for the number of years in which s/he contributed to the DB Plan.
(vii)
At the time of retirement, a DB Plan Participant may choose to designate a qualified beneficiary (as defined in Section 6-2(f)(3)(i) below) who will receive 75% of the DB Plan Participant's Pension Benefit at the time of said Participant's death. Where the DB Plan Participant designates a beneficiary, her/his Pension Benefit shall be re-calculated using the assumption that it is a single-life annuity with duration through the life of the DB Plan Participant. A DB Plan Participant who designates a beneficiary will have his/her monthly Pension Benefit reduced. A calculation shall be performed to determine the City's expected total Pension Benefit payout to the Employee if s/he had no beneficiary. The actuarial equivalent of that expected total shall be determined for the expected total Pension Benefit payout with the Employee's designated beneficiary. This actuarial equivalence shall be utilized to determine the DB Plan Participant's reduced monthly Pension Benefit amount, so that the total Pension Benefit cost to the City is not increased by the election of a beneficiary. Upon the death of the DB Plan Participant, 75% of Employee's Pension Benefit amount will be paid as a monthly benefit to the identified qualified beneficiary as described in Section 6-2(f)(3)(i). The percentage payable to the beneficiary shall comply with the U.S. Treasury regulations § 1.401 (a)(9)-6, relating to the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) requirement under IRC § 401(a)(9)(G).
(e)
Long Term Disability Benefit.
(1)
A Long Term Disability Benefit or Disability Benefit is established pursuant to this Section 6-2, and is different from the Disability Pension established in and provided pursuant to the DB Plans. Eligible Employees whose Date of Disability is on or after November 1, 2011 shall be eligible for a Disability Benefit pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 6-2(e). The Eligible Employee must submit a completed application to the Disability and Survivor Benefits Committee to apply for a Disability Benefit.
(2)
The following provisions shall apply to the calculation of the Disability Benefit for every Eligible Employee:
(i)
The City will provide a Long Term Disability Benefit to an Eligible Employee who is determined to be Totally and Permanently Disabled by the Disability and Survivor Benefits Committee. The DSB Committee shall make its determination by utilizing a preponderance of the evidence standard, and shall base its decision on official medical records, other documentary evidence, qualified medical expert opinions, sworn testimony, and/or other reliable sources accepted by the DSB Committee. The DSB Committee shall provide its determination in writing, with a detailed explanation of the supporting evidence. The City or the Eligible Employee may appeal the DSB Committee's determination pursuant to applicable law and the process established by the DSB Committee.
(A)
Where the Eligible Employee applies for a Disability Benefit and a Disability Pension for the same underlying condition, the Eligible Employee shall submit identical applications and information to the DSB Committee and the appropriate Pension Board. All hearings regarding the application, including any appeal hearings, shall be presented to the DSB Committee and appropriate Pension Board simultaneously.
(B)
The DSB Committee shall make a final determination about whether the Eligible Employee may receive a Disability Benefit. The DSB Committee decision shall be separate from the decision of the applicable Pension Board regarding the Disability Pension. It is acceptable for the determinations of the two bodies to differ.
(C)
This process shall be utilized for determinations regarding whether an injury qualifies as a Disability in the Line of Duty or a Catastrophic Injury in the Line of Duty, and also whether Survivor Benefits shall be awarded as set forth in Section 6-2(e) below.
(ii)
The Long Term Disability Benefit provided to an Eligible Employee shall begin after the Employee has utilized all of her/his accumulated sick leave.
(iii)
The Long Term Disability Benefit shall continue until the earlier of the end of the Eligible Employee's Total and Permanent Disability, the Eligible Employee's attainment of Retirement Age or Thirty Years of Service, or death of the Eligible Employee.
(iv)
During the time that an Eligible Employee is receiving a Disability Benefit, the Employee's and the City's mandatory contributions to the Employee's Retirement Plan shall cease except as set forth in Subsection (e)(2)(vii) below. The Employee may make Voluntary Contributions to the 457(b) portion of her/his Retirement Account. The City will not match any portion of the Voluntary Contributions while the Employee is receiving a Disability Benefit.
(v)
The monthly amount of a DB Plan Participant's Long Term Disability Benefit shall be reduced by the monthly amount of her/his Disability Pension, where such Disability Pension is calculated under the applicable DB Pension Plan as amended by this Section 6-2.
(vi)
In the event that the Eligible Employee receiving a Long Term Disability Benefit also receives a Workers' Compensation award for the same illness or injury for which the City is paying a Disability Benefit, the monthly amount of the Disability Benefit shall be reduced such that the sum of the monthly Disability Benefit amount, plus the monthly Disability Pension amount if any, plus the monthly value of the Workers' Compensation award, does not exceed 75% of the Eligible Employee's Monthly Compensation. This Section 6-2(e)(2)(vi) shall not apply to Eligible Employees who suffered a Catastrophic Injury in the Line of Duty, as defined in Section 6-2(e)(3)(iii) below.

The terms of calculating and providing the Survivor Benefit are set forth below in this Section 6-2(f). The Survivor Benefit is different from the survivor pension benefit established in and provided pursuant to the DB Plans. DB Plan Participants hired prior to September 1, 2011, except for DB Hybrid Participants, may not receive a Survivor Benefit, but shall be eligible to receive a Survivor Pension through the applicable DB Plan.
(2)
The City of Atlanta will provide a Survivor Benefit that shall be paid monthly to the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of an Eligible Employee at the time of her/his death, as calculated below in this Section 6-2(f), but only if the death occurs prior to the Eligible Employee's retirement.
(3)
Each Eligible Employee must designate a primary beneficiary and, if desired, a secondary beneficiary for the purpose of receiving a Survivor Benefit.

If the primary beneficiary should no longer meet the definition of "Qualified Beneficiary" at the time of the Eligible Employee's death, the entire Survivor Benefit shall be provided to the secondary beneficiary (if any) provided that s/he is a Qualified Beneficiary.
(4)
Upon the death of an Eligible Employee, her/his primary and/or secondary Beneficiary may apply to the Disability and Survivor Benefits Committee for a Survivor Benefit equal to 75% of the application of the following formula:
(i)
For Eligible Employees who are sworn members of the Atlanta Police Department or Atlanta Fire Rescue Department and hired before November 1, 2011: Monthly Compensation, multiplied by Years of Service at the date of death, multiplied by 3%, multiplied by the Vesting Percentage (if any) set forth in Section 6-2(d)(4)(ii)(B) above.
(ii)
For all non-sworn Eligible Employees hired before November 1, 2011: Monthly Compensation, multiplied by Years of Service at the date of death, multiplied by 2.5%, multiplied by the Vesting Percentage (if any) set forth in Section 6-2(d)(4)(ii)(B) above.
(iii)
For all Eligible Employees hired on or after November 1, 2011: Monthly Compensation, multiplied by Years of Service at the date of death, multiplied by 2%, multiplied by the Vesting Percentage (if any) set forth in Section 6-2(d)(4)(ii)(B) above.

(5)
The total monthly value of the Survivor Benefit shall be reduced by the monthly amount of the Eligible Employee's survivor pension benefit as calculated under the applicable DB Pension Plan as amended by this Section 6-2, such that the total monthly payment of the Survivor Benefit plus the survivor pension benefit shall not exceed 100% of the monthly value of the Survivor Benefit as calculated herein.
(6)
Where an Eligible Employee dies as a result of injuries incurred in the line of duty, her/his primary Qualified Beneficiary may receive a monthly payment for two years following the date of the Employee's death, and such payment shall be equal to the Compensation to which such Eligible Employee would have been entitled had s/he remained in active service. At the expiration of the two-year period referred to herein, the Survivor Benefit due the primary beneficiary shall be computed in accordance with the formula described in Section 6-2(f)(4) above, except that the Eligible Employee's vesting percentage shall be calculated as 100%. The Survivor Benefit for a primary Qualified Beneficiary shall be paid to the secondary Qualified Beneficiary or Beneficiaries upon the death or ineligibility of the primary Qualified Beneficiary.
(7)
The Commissioner of the Department of Human Resources shall immediately notify the Disability Survivor Benefit Committee upon the death of any employee in her/his Department.

It shall also determine whether the primary and secondary beneficiaries are Qualified Beneficiaries. The written determination shall be issued within 90 days of the date on which the DSB Committee was informed of the death.

In order to select the DB Hybrid Option, the DB Plan Participant must notify the City in writing in the manner and at the time prescribed by the City. Where the Employee does not provide written notification as prescribed by the City, the Employee will be deemed as choosing not to participate in the DB Hybrid Option. A decision of whether to participate in the DB hybrid Option is irreversible.
(2)
Upon retirement, a DB Hybrid Participant shall receive the Pension Benefit s/he accumulated prior to November 1, 2011 (the calculation of which may include Compensation for work performed on or after November 1, 2011), plus the benefits accumulated from the Retirement Plan on and after November 1. 2011.
(3)
For the Pension Benefit accumulated prior to November 1, 2011 by a DB Hybrid Participant, the amount of the Employee's pension ("Pre-Change Pension Benefit") shall be calculated as set forth below in Section 6-2(g)(6).
(4)
Retirement Plan contributions by a DB Hybrid Participant on and after November 1. 2011 shall consist of 1) DB Plan Contributions as set forth in Section 6-2(d)(3) above; 2) DC Plan Mandatory Contributions as set forth in Section 6-2(c)(2) above; and may include 3) DC Plan Voluntary Contributions as set forth in Section 6-2(c)(5) above.

The Retirement Age and Age Penalty shall be determined in the manner utilized for DB Members hired prior to September 1, 2011 who are not DB Hybrid Participants; 2) earnings from the Employee's Mandatory Contributions into the Section 401(a) portion of her/his Retirement Account and related City match contributions as described above in Section 6-2(c)(2); and earnings from the Employee's Voluntary Contributions into the Section 457(b) portion of her/his Retirement Account and related City match contributions as set forth in Section 6-2(c)(5).
(6)
The calculation of the DB Hybrid Participant's Pre-Change Pension Benefit shall be as set forth in Section 6-2(d)(4) above, except for the following:
(i)
The value of Years of Service in the DB Hybrid Participant's Pre-Change Pension Benefit Formula shall be the Years of Service between her/his date of hire and November 1, 2011. The value of the Years of Service factor in the DB Plan Participant's Pre-Change Benefit Formula shall be equal to the Years of Service accrued as of midnight on October 31, 2011. The DB Plan Participant will have a one-time opportunity to utilize her/his unused sick leave as of midnight October 31, 2011 to increase the Years of Service value in the Pre-Change Benefit Formula, provided that s/he retains no fewer than 80 hours of unused sick leave for future use. The increase shall be calculated as described in the applicable DB Plan, except that retirement shall not be required to apply the sick leave in this manner. The DB Plan Participant must designate the number of sick leave hours s/he wishes to apply to the Pre-Change Benefit Formula prior to November 1, 2011, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the City. Any sick leave hours used by the DB Plan Participant to enhance her/his Years of Service value may not be used in the future for sick leave or any other purpose
(ii)
The value of Annual Compensation in the DB Hybrid Participant's Pre-Change Pension Benefit Formula shall be calculated based upon the highest Compensation received by the Employee over a consecutive 36 month period, regardless of whether all or a portion of the consecutive 36 months occurs prior to November 1, 2011. The Compensation amount may be increased by adding the value of unused annual leave as described in the applicable DB Plan.
(7)
The Long Term Disability Benefits and Survivor Benefits afforded to DB Employees hired on or after November 1, 2011, as described in Sections 6-2(e) and (f) above, shall be provided to DB Hybrid Participants on and after November 1, 2011.
(h)
The City will engage an accredited actuarial firm to provide annual actuarial valuations ("Actuarial Valuation") of the three Defined Benefit Plans. Each Actuarial Valuation shall include a calculation of the Actual Required Contribution ("ARC") owed by the City in the upcoming fiscal year.
(1)
Where an Actuarial Valuation anticipates that the City's ARC for the next fiscal year will exceed 35% of the Total Payroll (the "Cap"), a Cost Recovery Plan shall be implemented. The Cost Recovery Plan shall consist of the following:
(i)
The Mayor or her/his designee shall direct the actuary to present an analysis of the ARC's escalation and to provide additional information as requested by herself/himself or by the City Council.
(ii)
The first fiscal year that the ARC exceeds the Cap, the City will pay the full amount of the Overage. The Overage shall be paid from the City's General Fund reserves, and the details of the payment will be set forth in duly enacted legislation.
(iii)
During that first fiscal year, a committee shall be formed to identify potential methods and sources for mitigating and/or paying for the Overage in future fiscal years, and the committee shall provide recommendations to the City Council and the Mayor. These recommendations may include, without limitation, increasing employee and/or City DB contributions, modifying pension benefits, and/or utilizing alternative funding sources. The Committee shall be comprised of: the Mayor or her/his designee; the City Council President or her/his designee; the Chair of the Finance Executive Committee; the Chief Operating Officer; the Chief Financial Officer; the City Attorney; one elected representative from the General Employees' Pension Fund, from the Firefighters' Pension Fund, and from the Police Officers' Pension Fund; and the President or her/his designee of AFSCME, IAFF, IBPO and PACE, or the successor organization of any of these unions. No recommendation by the committee shall take effect unless and until it is authorized by duly enacted legislation.
(iv)
In the event that the City fails to enact legislation directing how the Overage will be funded during the second and/or future years in which the CAP is exceeded, the cost of the Overage shall be shared equally by the City and the DB Plan Participants. The DB Plan Participants shall pay their portion of the Overage through increased contributions in a cumulative amount that is one half of the Overage, except that the amount of a Participant's increased contribution in any given fiscal year shall not exceed 5% of her/his Compensation. This increase amount shall be paid in addition to the Employee's current DB Plan contribution as set forth in Section 6-2(d)(2), (d)(3) or (g)(4). The City will pay the full amount of that portion of the Overage that exceeds 10% in any given fiscal year. In a fiscal year where no Overage exists, the Employee shall not pay an increased DB Plan contribution, but shall pay only her/his current DB Plan contribution as established by Section 6-2(d)(2), (d)(3) or (g)(4).
(v)
In each fiscal year for which the City has failed to enact legislation directing how the Overage will be funded, the amount of the Employees' and the City's increased contributions shall be modified based upon the size of the Overage as set forth in the Actuarial Valuation. The amount of the increased contributions shall be calculated as set forth in the immediately preceding subsection (iv). For the avoidance of doubt, each DB Plan Participant's 5% of Compensation increase amount shall not escalate above the 5% total from year to year.
(vi)
Where the Overage is eliminated in a fiscal year, but reappears within one or both of the next two fiscal years, the payment of the Overage shall be shared by the DB Plan Participants and the City as set forth in Subsections (iv) and (v) above, without the one year payment made solely by the City as set forth in Subsection (ii) above. Where the Overage is eliminated and the ARC remains lower than the CAP for more than 2 consecutive fiscal years, a new Cost Recovery Plan shall thereafter be implemented if and when the ARC exceeds the CAP.
(2)
In the event that the unfunded liability amount reaches 15% or less, the City may reduce the DB Plan Participants' contribution amount through duly enacted legislation.
(3)
If a Court with jurisdiction over this matter rules that this Section 6-2(i) is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Section 6-2 shall not be affected or impaired by said ruling.
(i)
The City may modify one or more of the DB Plans, the DC Retirement Plan, and/or any other aspect of the Retirement Plan in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws.
