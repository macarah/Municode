Sworn members of the department of police in the nondiscretionary ranks of police officer, sergeant, lieutenant and captain on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives shall be given status in the nondiscretionary ranks they hold as of that date.

The weights shall be stated as percentages, and the total weight of all parts of an examination process shall equal 100 percent. Each candidate passing all parts of the examination process shall have the final score computed in accordance with these weights and in accordance with appropriate scientific procedures, so that the stated weights are accurately reflected.

(b)
Sworn members will be allowed to appeal to the test developer, in writing, any answer to a written test question other than the one specified as being the correct answer.

Because of the need to use written tests which have been professionally developed and validated in accordance with both professional standards and legal guidelines, all sworn members reviewing test papers are expressly forbidden from taking any test material, review material or any written notes from the review room.

(c)
The probationary period shall be utilized for closely observing how well a probationary employee performs the work and responsibility of the higher level rank and for securing the most accurate judgments as to whether or not the probationary employee's performance meets required work standards at the higher level rank.

(d)
At least 30 days prior to the completion of the 12-month probationary period, the police chief shall determine whether or not the probationary employee should receive status in the higher rank.
