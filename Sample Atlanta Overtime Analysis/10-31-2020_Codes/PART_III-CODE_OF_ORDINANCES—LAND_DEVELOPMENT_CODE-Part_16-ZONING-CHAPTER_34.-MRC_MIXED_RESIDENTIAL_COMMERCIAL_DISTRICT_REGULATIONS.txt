Sec. 16-34.001. - Authority.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the City of Atlanta's exclusive zoning and planning authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to the Article 9, Section 2, Paragraph 3 and Article 9 Section 2, Paragraph 4, as well as authority granted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to O.C.G.A. § 36-70-3, the City of Atlanta Charter, §§ 3-061 through 3-603, and Charter Appendix IV, §§ 41,42,45,48 and 70, as well as the general police powers of the City of Atlanta and such other authority as may be provided by applicable, state, federal and local laws.
The regulations set forth in this chapter, or set forth elsewhere in this part when referred to in this chapter, are regulations which are applicable in those parts of the city designated as MRC Mixed Residential Commercial district. The passage of an ordinance approving the classification of an area of the city for Mixed Residential Commercial zoning shall supplant the zoning classifications applicable to the area so designated.

(Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 5-28-02)
Sec. 16-34.002. - Findings, purpose and intent.
The city finds that the size, scale and character of commercial uses directly affect the adjacent neighborhood districts and the public health, safety and welfare. The city finds that highway-oriented retail, service, office and dining uses which are intended to serve larger areas of the city instead of a single neighborhood or small group of neighborhoods must be located on streets that are suited for this type of development and must be done in a manner which is compatible with the adjacent neighborhoods or group of neighborhoods. The city finds there is a need to protect existing and developing neighborhood areas and building forms from the incompatible uses resulting from intense highway-oriented development and to preserve and restore existing, traditional and pedestrian scale buildings in established, historic neighborhood districts, as well as create new pedestrian oriented commercial nodes. The city finds that there is a substantial need to encourage a balanced mix of uses to include proportionately significant residential uses and to facilitate safe, attractive and convenient pedestrian circulation. The city finds that it is necessary to improve air quality by promoting walking and reducing the number of vehicular trips. The city finds that it is necessary to establish adequate parking requirements by encouraging shared parking arrangements. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of this chapter, in establishing the Mixed Residential Commercial (MRC) district, is as follows:
1.
Create a diversified city where people across the spectrum of age, income, ethnicity, and culture can live, work, shop, meet, and play;
2.
Encourage infill and rehabilitation development within traditionally commercial areas that include proportionately significant residential uses;
3.
Encourage the development of multi-family housing within commercial areas;
4.
Alleviate development pressure on existing residential neighborhoods by placing reasonable controls on development and expansion of strip commercial areas within primarily single-family neighborhoods;
5.
Place reasonable controls on the development of larger scale highway-oriented retail, service, office and dining uses which are intended to serve larger areas of the city than a single neighborhood or a small group of neighborhoods;
6.
Improve the aesthetics of the built environment;
7.
Protect existing neighborhoods from uses and building forms which are incompatible with the scale, character and needs of the adjacent neighborhoods;
8.
Ensure pedestrian-oriented building forms;
9.
Provide for a pedestrian-oriented environment on streets and sidewalks;
10.
Promote public safety through the provision of pedestrian-oriented street-level uses, sufficient sidewalk widths, adequate visibility from adjacent buildings and primary pedestrian access from buildings to adjacent sidewalks;
11.
Ensure residents have convenient pedestrian access to nearby commercial uses;
12.
Provide stable single-family neighborhoods with nodal commercial areas which are such a size that all uses are within convenient walking distance of one another;
13.
Promote an appropriate balance and scale of commercial uses which meet the needs of nearby residents;
14.
Encourage a compatible mixture of residential, commercial, cultural and recreational uses;
15.
Provide a range of housing types and prices to meet different housing needs;
16.
Reserve the space between the building and the sidewalk for pedestrian related uses;
17.
Provide appropriately scaled, continuous pedestrian oriented uses and activities adjacent to sidewalks along streets with identified pedestrian needs;
18.
Encourage a grid of connected streets to improve access and reduce congestion;
19.
Facilitate safe, pleasant and convenient pedestrian circulation and minimize conflict between pedestrians and vehicles;
20.
Facilitate safe and convenient bicycle usage;
21.
Prevent encroachment of incompatible commercial uses and minimize commercial parking into residential neighborhoods;
22.
Provide sufficient parking in an unobtrusive manner;
23.
Reduce parking requirements by encouraging shared parking and alternative modes of transportation;
24.
Maximize opportunities for pedestrian amenities, including parks, plazas, greenways and public art;
25.
Provide sufficient, safe and accessible parks, plazas and greenways for active and passive enjoyment;
26.
Improve the quality of air and water through provisions for the planting of trees, greenspace protection, bicycle parking and electric vehicle parking.

Sec. 16-34.003. - Special administrative permit requirement for building permits—Effect on other special permit requirements.
Except as provided below, no building permit in any Mixed Residential Commercial district shall be issued unless and until it has been approved through the issuance of a special administrative permit (SAP) under the requirements so specified in section 16-25.004, as meeting applicable requirements and intent as set forth for the district involved. A SAP application and seven copies each of a site plan, landscape plan and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the director of the bureau of planning prior to the issuance of a building permit, with an eighth copy to be mailed concurrently to the appropriate NPU chair or his/her designee-for information purposes.
Where regulations may require the approval of a special administrative permit for other purposes so specified, processing by the director of the bureau of planning shall, without additional application, include consideration of other special administrative permits. Where such regulations require special exception or special use permit action, the special administrative permit for building permit purposes shall not be issued until the necessary approval has been obtained for special exception or special use permit.
(Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 5-28-02)
Sec. 16-34.003A. - Provisions for administrative variations from regulations.
As part of general action when plans require approval of a special administrative permit, the director of the bureau of planning may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings that either:
1.
A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accord with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree; or
2.
In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at the time or in the future.
Notation concerning the existence of such variation shall be made by written findings of SAP approval to be filed in the office of zoning and development as public record. Variances and special exceptions shall be required from the board of zoning adjustment (BZA) in cases such as minimum yards (not adjacent to the street), minimum transitional yards, transitional height planes, minimum open spaces, maximum building height, maximum fence height, minimum parking and loading requirements and signage limitations.
