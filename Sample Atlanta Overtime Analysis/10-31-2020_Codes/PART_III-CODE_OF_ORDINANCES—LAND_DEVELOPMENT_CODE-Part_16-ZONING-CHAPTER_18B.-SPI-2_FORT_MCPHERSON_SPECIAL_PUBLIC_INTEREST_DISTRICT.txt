(1)
A Special Administrative Permit (SAP) application and a specified number of copies each of a site plan, landscape plan, and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the Office of Zoning and Development prior to filing a building permit application. All exterior demolition, new construction (including additions to existing buildings), new or expanded outdoor dining, or work which results in increased lot coverage, modification of the building footprint, or modification of building facades that would reduce the configuration of street facing openings, shall be subject to said SAP approval. All applications for a SAP shall be processed in accordance with the standards and procedures applicable to said SAP applications contained in Chapter 25 of Part 16 except as otherwise modified by this chapter 18B. No SAP shall be approved until after such time any other required Special Use Permit or Board of Zoning Adjustment action has been obtained.
(2)
Administrative variations: As part of general action when plans require approval of an SAP, the Office of Zoning and Development may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings that either:
a.
A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accordance with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent of such regulations, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree than strict enforcement of such regulations would provide; or
b.
In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at that time or in the future.
(3)
For the purposes of this chapter, a unified development plan approved under a single SAP and meeting all floor area ratio requirements, open space requirements, and off-street parking requirements, may be subdivided, even if the resultant parcels do not otherwise meet these requirements. Any changes from the approved SAP shall require a new or amended SAP, as determined by the Office of Zoning and Development, which shall be based on the geographic extent of the original SAP and shall meet floor area ratio requirements, open space requirements, and off-street parking requirements of such; and shall indicate built or planned improvements on the original parcel(s). Where a single property owner no longer owns all parcels, the applicant shall obtain written authorization from all property owners which shall be submitted with the SAP application.
(4)
In addition to all review processes specified in Section 16-18B, all SAP applications for proposals on or are located within 50 ft. of a building or site listed in Table 2 shall be referred to the Director of the Atlanta Urban Design Commission for review. The Director of the Atlanta Urban Design Commission or their designee in the Office of Design, shall be required to review and approve the proposed work per the requirements set forth in Section 16-18B.020 prior to final issuance of the SAP by the Office of Zoning and Development.

Considerations on proposed moving of structures, in whole or in part, shall include the effect on the neighborhood from which the move is made. In general, where the structure forms a significant part of a complex of similarly meritorious buildings, preference shall be given to relocation on a site elsewhere in the district. Where the structure does not form part of such a complex, preference shall be given to removal to a location in which the addition will reinforce existing complexes of buildings of significant historic, architectural and/or cultural character.
(11)
The height or width of any alteration or addition shall not exceed the height or width of the existing building, and any additions shall be located to the rear of the building.
(12)
Site work. Any major alterations to the hardscape, landscape or topography shall:
a.
Maintain the spatial organization of any original open space around the building or on the site;
b.
Not excessively or unnecessarily alter the natural topography of the site, with the exception of grading necessary to protect and preserve the integrity of a structure;
c.
Ensure that any new grades shall meet the existing topography in a smooth transition;
d.
Retain any existing historic circulation systems, including driveways, walkways and paths; and
e.
Ensure that any new circulation systems and substantial reconstruction of existing circulation systems is compatible with the existing circulation systems with respect to layout, scale, materials, and topographic siting.
(13)
Signage. Signs attached to buildings listed in Table 2 to the ordinance creating this district or located within 50 ft. of a building listed in Table 2 to the ordinance creating this district shall be designed in a manner that is compatible with the design, materials and general character of signage from the time period of historical significance for the structure.
