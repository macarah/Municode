The chairperson and the NPU shall review the proposed subdivision plat utilizing only the standards and criteria set forth in this part and provide a copy of said comments to the applicant and to district and at-large members of council representing the district within which the subject property is located. The bureau of planning shall post a sign so as to inform the adjacent neighborhood of a proposed subdivision application. Said sign shall include the date of the scheduled NPU meeting at which said application will be discussed.
(e)
Action by Commissioner of Public Transportation. No preliminary subdivision plat shall be approved prior to the receipt of a letter from the commissioner of the department of transportation approving the subject preliminary subdivision plat as being in compliance with the provisions of this part and any other applicable code provisions, rules and regulations. No final subdivision plat shall be approved until all required improvements have been made, inspected and accepted by the commissioner of the department of public transportation. Further, no final subdivision plat shall be approved prior to the commissioner of the department of transportation having approved the subject final subdivision plat by affixing his or her signature to the original copy of the final plat as being in compliance with this part and any other applicable code provisions, rules and regulations.
(f)
Action by Director of Bureau of Planning.
(1)
After all changes and corrections identified in the meeting of the subdivision review committee are made, and after approval by the commissioner of the department of transportation as is provided in (e) above, the application shall be presented to the director of the bureau of planning for approval or disapproval of the preliminary subdivision plat or the final subdivision plat, as the case may be. The director shall review and make a part of the record any written comments that were received from the appropriate neighborhood planning unit regarding the subject application.
(2)
If a preliminary subdivision plat has been approved by the commissioner of the department of transportation and meets all other applicable requirements of parts 15 and 16 of this Code, the director, bureau of planning shall approve the subject preliminary subdivision plat. If a preliminary subdivision plat has not been approved by the commissioner of the department of transportation, or fails to meet the applicable requirements of parts 15 and 16 of this code, the director, bureau of planning shall disapprove the subject preliminary subdivision. The director shall notify the applicant in writing of the final decision regarding a preliminary subdivision plat.
(3)
If a final subdivision plat has been approved by the commissioner of the department of transportation and meets all other applicable requirements of parts 15 and 16 of this Code, the director, bureau of planning shall approve the subject final subdivision plat and cause the final plat to be recorded in the records of Fulton or DeKalb County as is appropriate. If a final subdivision plat has not been approved by the commissioner of the department of transportation, or, fails to meet the applicable requirements of parts 15 and 16 of this code, the director, bureau of planning shall disapprove the subject final subdivision and notify the applicant in writing of said disapproval.
The director, bureau of planning shall make a decision regarding each final plat submitted no later than 15 days after the date of submission of said final plat. Approval by the director, bureau of planning shall appear on the original drawing. Final plat approval by the director, bureau of planning shall constitute that approval, if any, required by the governing authority of the City of Atlanta pursuant to O.C.G.A. section 15-6-67(d). If requested by the applicant, and if otherwise in accord with the requirements of this part, the director shall have the authority to re-record final plats for the purpose of revising lot lines where no new lot is created. If requested by the applicant, the final plat may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which the applicant proposes to record and develop in a single phase.
(4)
The director shall provide a copy of any written decision on any preliminary or final subdivision plat to the applicant, to all review agencies listed in (b) above, to the appropriate at-large and district member of council, and to the appropriate neighborhood planning committee chairperson.
(5)
The final plat shall be submitted to the bureau of planning not later than one year after approval of the preliminary plat; otherwise the approval of the preliminary plat shall become null and void unless an extension of time is granted by the bureau of planning. An applicant may request a single extension of no more than 12 months only in the case of a sewer moratorium, unavailable financing, industry work stoppage, severe detrimental weather conditions, death or disability of managing partner and similar clearly established hardship conditions.
(g)
Limitation on Application for Variances. It is the intent of this part to prohibit the creation of lots that require a variance in order to be developed. Therefore, once a final plat has been approved by the director, bureau of planning, no application for a variance on any lot in said subdivision may be submitted for a period of one year from the date of final approval of said plat unless an unknown site condition is discovered which creates a hardship within the meaning of chapter 26 of part 16 of this Code.
(h)
No Grading or Site Preparation Prior to Necessary Permits. No permits for grading or other site preparation work shall be granted prior to final approval of the preliminary plat or final plat. No grading, tree cutting or other site preparation work shall commence until all required permits under this part and any other applicable ordinance, including any applicable tree ordinance, have been obtained.

A written request, accompanied by one original mylar plat showing existing and proposed property boundaries and all other applicable information specified in section 15-07.003, is submitted to the director;
(2)
No additional lot is created; and
(3)
Each newly platted lot conforms to all requirements of part 15 and part 16 of the Code of Ordinances, provided that if either lot, as platted prior to the proposed replatting, does not conform to all requirements of part 15 and part 16, this condition shall nevertheless be deemed to have been met if said lot(s) are replatted in a manner that equals or reduces the degree of nonconformity.

Sec. 15-07.006. - Acknowledgement of lots of record existing prior to the sub-division ordinance.
(a)
Eligible Lots. The director shall acknowledge lots with a legal description filed with Clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County or DeKalb County prior to November 19, 1958, the effective date of the City of Atlanta Subdivision Ordinance, and which do not appear on the official cadastral map on which the bureau of planning has recorded the boundaries of lots recognized by the City of Atlanta provided that all of the following criteria can be satisfied:
1.
No portion of the property in any of the lots to be acknowledged shall have been included in any plat recorded with any other boundaries or dimensions in a manner that shows the intent to abandon the original property lines. Even if the lots on the subject property are currently in their original configuration, any past combination of any portion of the subject properties with another property in a manner that does not evidence intent to maintain the lots in their original configuration shall be considered an abandonment of the original property lines.
2.
Where a single deed includes multiple lots, only a separate metes and bounds description of each individual lot shall be a sufficient description of the original property lines. A legal description in a single deed which identifies multiple lots by reference to lot numbers on a subdivision plat shall not be considered to be a sufficient identification of individual boundaries to justify creation of lots of record unless the metes and bound descriptions of each of the individual lots are also set forth in that deed. A single deed referring to multiple lots on a subdivision plat created under the city's subdivision ordinance and approved and on file with the bureau of planning shall not be required to have a metes and bounds description in the deed so long as the subdivision plat contains a metes and bounds description of the lots and no principal structure, including decks, and porches and other attachments that would ordinarily be included in the building footprint, was constructed over any of the property lines of any lot to be acknowledged.
3.
No primary structure, including decks, and porches and other attachments that would ordinarily be included in the building footprint, shall have been constructed over any of the property lines of the lot to be acknowledged, regardless of whether such primary structure or the attachment thereto, has been or will be demolished. Any document or site plan submitted to the city at any time which shows that a building permit for the primary structure or an addition thereto was requested and granted shall be considered proof that such structure was constructed in that configuration even if the structure no longer exists.
4.
The person requesting the acknowledgment of the lot can produce a full and unbroken abstract of title for the exact legal description to be acknowledged which meets the current Title Standards of the State Bar of Georgia and which is attested to by an attorney licensed by the State of Georgia. The abstract of title must show to the satisfaction of the director that the lots to be acknowledged meet the requirements of this section.
5.
The acknowledgment of the lot does not conflict with other section of the City Code with respect to the creation of new lots of record.
6.
The application procedure is successfully completed.
(b)
Legal Effect. Lots approved as lots of record under this section shall be considered legally non-conforming lots of record and shall be recorded on the official cadastral map of the City of Atlanta.
(c)
Setback Requirements. Acknowledgement of lots of record under the process provided in this section shall not excuse an applicant for a building permit from any setback requirements for the zoning district where the lot is located.
(d)
Other Procedures Available. Applications that do not meet the criteria for acknowledgement of lots of record may still be eligible for subdivision of the property so long as the proposed subdivision meets all other requirements of the City Code.
(e)
Procedure for Application. Applicants requesting acknowledgement of historically platted lots of record shall comply with the following procedure:
1.
File a request for acknowledgement on the application form made available by the director. An application shall be accepted when offered to the bureau of planning and the director may designate one or more persons to accept applications. The address on the application is the location where the applicant agrees that all notices and other written communication shall be received.
2.
Each owner of record must show their consent to the procedure as evidenced by the submission of a notarized consent form in substantially the form and containing the same information as that form made available by the director. Consent forms from all owners of record must be submitted as a part of the application package before an application will be accepted.
3.
Submit a certified copy of the recorded plat currently on file in Fulton and/or DeKalb County. The plat must clearly outline the boundary dimensions of the subject lot and must be legible.
4.
Submit a full and unbroken abstract of title for the exact legal description to be acknowledged which meets the current Title Standards of the State Bar of Georgia and which is attested to by an attorney licensed by the State of Georgia.
(i)
The abstract of title must document that each lot to be recreated is eligible under the criteria set forth in this section.
(ii)
The abstract of title must document the transfer of the original lots since the recording of the original plat and document that no transaction has involved the abandonment of property lines through the combination or recombination of any portion of the original lots on the subject property with each other or with other adjacent properties.
5.
Submit three copies of a recordable plat or survey showing existing and proposed property boundaries and all other applicable information specified in section 15-07.004.
(i)
The plat or survey must be clear and legible and shall not exceed 17"x 22".
(ii)
The plat or survey must show the proposed property boundaries as a solid line.
(iii)
The plat or survey must include original signatures across the surveyor's seal on the mylar and/or on the copies.

(iii)
If the applicant requests deferral of NPU consideration and so informs the director, the NPU consideration at the agreed upon meeting date shall be considered timely and the director may reschedule consideration of the application. If the NPU defers on the consideration of the application, this shall be considered waiver of the opportunity for review.
(iv)
The NPU shall be responsible for making its recommendations available to the director for consideration by the staff.
4.
Failure of the director to accomplish the tasks required for the required notifications shall not entitle an applicant to approval of the application but the applicant shall have the right to have their application reviewed by the bureau of planning within 180 days of the date that a complete application is received.
(g)
Citizen Input.

The director shall review and make a part of the record any written comments that were received from the neighborhood planning unit and individual citizens regarding the subject application and any amendments to the application. The director shall review and take action on the application within 60 days of the date of meeting of the subdivision review committee associated with the closing date for the acknowledgement application or the last date that amendments are received from whichever is later. The applicant may request in writing that the date for final decision by the director be deferred to a date certain but the director shall not be required to agree to extend the date of decision. If an action is not taken by the director within the time as stated above or as extended, the application shall not deemed approved or denied but the applicant may request in writing that such decision be issued.

(a)
All proposed subdivisions shall be laid out and designed in an orderly pattern of development so as to provide for developable lots on both sides of all new streets and uniform building setbacks for all lots which radiate from the end of cul-de-sac street. No subdivision shall be approved in which lots are created on only one side of a new street. No subdivision shall be approved in which there is a reserved strip of land along any portion of any street proposed to be created, regardless of the form of ownership which may be proposed for the reserved strip of land, except in the case of a parcel acquired by the applicant to provide access to an interior subdivision. In that event the access parcel shall be wide enough to contain the required street right-of-way and in addition shall have a width equal to the width required to provide the minimum corner lot side setback from the proposed street to each existing house on the contiguous lots. The applicant may offer that portion of the side buffer strips to the contiguous homeowners as necessary to create a conforming corner lot, or, in the alternative may provide that a homeowners association maintain and operate the side buffer strips on either side of the entrance parcel. Side buffer strips shall not be included in calculations for required lot area. The director may waive the requirement set forth in this section that new streets shall have lots on both sides of said new street in cases where the subject site abuts a lake, or a public park or other permanent open space having a depth which is no less than 50 percent of the average depth of the lots in the proposed subdivision.
(b)
Each proposed subdivision plat shall indicate the buildable area of each proposed lot. In any case where yard requirements specified in parts 15 and 16 of this Code differ, the more restrictive requirement shall apply.
(c)
Except for lots created for use as an amenity area, each lot to be created shall have a developable area for a residence and for accessory uses that meets the requirements of this part and of part 16 of this Code. Lots created for use as an amenity area shall be reviewed by the director of the Office of Zoning and Development to ensure that the amenity area is sufficiently buffered from and will not negatively impact surrounding properties, is of a size and shape to safely and adequately accomplish its proposed use, and is in an appropriate location that is accessible to the subdivision's residents. Lots which contain floodplains, wetlands, areas of severe slope, or other restrictive easements shall be reviewed by said director to ensure that the developable area is of the size and shape required by this part to permit the intended residential use. The minimum developable area for a dwelling shall be one continuous area containing a minimum square footage for a dwelling as follows, and minimum square footage to allow space for accessory uses, and a total developable area as follows:

(1)
Lots on cul-de-sac streets shall have side lot lines which are within 10 degrees of radial to the center of the ball of the cul-de-sac, shall have no less than 35 feet of frontage on the ball of the cul-de-sac, and shall have the required amount of frontage as is specified within the applicable zoning district regulation at the required front yard building setback line for that lot.
(2)
Corner lots are required to provide a half-depth front yard setback along the side street side. Corner lots shall have a street frontage which is 10 percent greater than the amount otherwise required by the applicable zoning district regulation.
(3)
Side lot lines on curved streets shall be within 10 degrees of radial to the curved street line, shall have no less than 35 feet of frontage at the street, and shall have the required amount of frontage as is specified within the applicable zoning district regulation at the required front yard setback line for that lot.
(4)
All lots, other than lots on the ball of cul-de-sac, corner lots, and lots on curved streets, which are described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) above, shall have the amount of lot frontage required by the applicable zoning district regulation. All such lots shall have side lot lines ranging between 80 and 100 degrees except where the existing side lot lines are approximately parallel to each other and intersect the adjacent street at an angle of not less than 60 degrees, and the proposed side lot lines replicate the existing side lot line pattern.
(5)
Double-frontage lots shall be prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries. Where such double-frontage lots are permitted, there shall be provided an undisturbed buffer zone of at least 20 feet along the major traffic artery over which there shall be no right of vehicular access.
(6)
In all historic neighborhoods, in which lot layout, patterns, and design are a part of and are directly related to identified elements of that neighborhood's character, all new lots shall conform to existing lot layout, patterns, and design, including, without limitation, orientation of lots to public streets.
(e)
Land subject to flooding and land that is topographically unsuitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy nor for other uses when to do so will create or increase danger to health, life, or property or aggravate erosion or flood hazard. Such land within the subdivision shall be set aside for such uses as shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
(f)
Dedication of Land in Floodplains, Wetland Areas, Stream and Creek Beds and Areas of Severe Slope. Any land which is located within the limits of the 100-year floodplain, within a wetland area, adjacent to a stream or creek bed, or has a slope in excess of 60 degrees may, at the option of the applicant, either be designated on the subdivision plat as an area which will remain in perpetuity as an undisturbed area or may be deeded in fee or easement to the City of Atlanta or other government or to a private not-for-profit corporation authorized to receive land grants and approved by the governing authority, or may alternatively choose neither of the options described above.
(g)
Land Previously Used for Landfill.
(1)
In any application for subdivision where the site has previously been used, in whole or in part, as a landfill, no such application shall be given final approval until all of the data described in (2) below has been submitted and the commissioner of the department of public works has made a finding, based on all said data provided pursuant to two (2) below, that the subject site is safe for development.
(2)
The applicant shall submit geotechnical data, including a description of subsurface conditions, describing the character of any materials under the proposed subdivision site that may adversely affect the stability or settlement of proposed buildings or structures, and the presence of any soil contaminant which may adversely affect the use of proposed buildings or structures and the health and safety of future occupants of the subject site. Said geotechnical data shall be certified by a registered professional engineer and shall contain the following information:
a.
Boring logs at a frequency determined by the commissioner of the department of public works, including soils laboratory data from a recognized testing laboratory; and
b.
Analysis of the soil composition with specific analysis to determine the presence of methane or similar hazardous gases; and

Sec. 15-08.006. - Stormwater detention areas.
Where water detention facilities are required pursuant to this part, or by chapter 138 of this Code, or by any other applicable local, state or federal regulation, in the approval of any subdivision, the area or areas of any lot or lots on which that portion of the facility serving the area of the five-year storm storage elevation is located shall be increased by an amount equal to the total area of land which is required for the development of the water detention area.
Open water detention structures shall not be located within any yard adjacent to a public street, provided that the commissioner of the department of transportation may approve an underground detention facility that is so located, and further provided that where an applicant proposes to construct a collective detention area that serves as an amenity area for the entire subdivision, the director, bureau of planning shall have the discretion to approve said collective detention area. In both instances, the applicant shall provide an agreement holding the City of Atlanta harmless from liability for the construction and maintenance of said water management facilities, and the subdivision plat shall contain a notation that assigns all legal responsibility to the owners for the construction and maintenance of said water management facilities.
