Editor's note— Ord. No. 2020-66(20-O-1498) , § 1, adopted Nov. 25, 2020, repealed the former Art. X, §§ 74-501—74-523, and enacted a new Art. X as set out herein. The former Art. X pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2004-56, §§ 2—4, adopted Sept. 15, 2004; Ord. No. 2005-46, § 1, adopted July 26, 2005; Ord. No. 2013-05(12-O-1761), §§ 1—21, adopted Feb. 13, 2013.

Sec. 74-501. - Introduction.
It is hereby determined that:
(a)
Development and its associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;
(b)
Development also contributes to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
(c)
The impacts of post-development runoff quantity and quality adversely affects public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values, and other uses of lands and waters;
(d)
These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment by using green infrastructure, and other structural and nonstructural measures, including conserving or restoring open space and greenspace areas;
(e)
The city is required to comply with several state and federal laws, regulations, and permits, and the requirements of the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District's regional water plan related to managing the water quantity, velocity, and quality of post-development runoff;
(f)
The stormwater management standards are intended to encourage development that is environmentally functional, economically viable, and socially beneficial. It is acknowledged that conditions may arise where normal compliance is impractical or impossible and conditions associated with individual sites may justify use of the alternative compliance process; and
(g)
Therefore, the city has established this set of regulations governing the management of post-development runoff and the ongoing maintenance of stormwater management systems for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It is in the public interest to regulate post-development runoff discharges and stormwater management systems in order to minimize runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development runoff.
( Ord. No. 2020-66(20-O-1498) , § 1, 11-25-20)
Sec. 74-502. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain, and enhance the public health, safety, environment, and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of post-development runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment by focusing on the types of frequently occurring storm events that generate the most water quality impacts.
(b)
Proper management of post-development runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment, and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet those purposes through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding development that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(2)
Establish post-construction stormwater management, and site planning and design criteria to protect natural resources from the direct impacts of the development process, and to preserve and restore natural hydrologic conditions on development sites;
(3)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of runoff quantity and quality;
(4)
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management measures, stormwater better site design, vegetated green infrastructure, rainwater harvesting and reuse, and other innovative design practices that achieve runoff reduction;
(5)
Preserve greenspace, and other conservation areas by establishing minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(6)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater controls that meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(7)
Coordinate site design plans with the city's greenspace protection plan;
(8)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for operation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of private structural stormwater controls and private commitments for nonstructural stormwater management measures to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety or the environment;
(9)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active developments, and long-term compliance; and
(10)
Protect public health and safety by reducing the risk of localized flooding and reducing the amount of runoff entering public rights of way.

Sec. 74-520. - Ongoing inspection and maintenance of stormwater management systems.
(a)
Operation and maintenance agreements. An owner must comply with any operation and maintenance agreement.
(b)
Pre-existing facilities and other agreements. For any land that is not subject to an operation and maintenance agreement for a stormwater management system, the following shall apply:
(1)
Where another agreement is in place (such as an inspection and maintenance or indemnification agreement), the owner must comply with that agreement.
(2)
Where there is no agreement in place, the owner must maintain the stormwater management system in a manner that ensures that the system performs as originally designed.
(c)
Maintenance inspections of stormwater management systems. The following shall apply to all land regardless of the existence of an operation and maintenance agreement or other similar agreement:
(1)
Stormwater management systems must undergo ongoing inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of any agreement, any stormwater management plan and this article.
(2)
A stormwater management system shall be inspected in accordance with any operation and maintenance agreement or other similar agreement. In the absence of an operation and maintenance agreement or similar agreement, or where such an agreement does not provide for periodic inspections, the stormwater management system must be inspected by the owner at least annually.
(3)
In the event that the stormwater management system has not been maintained and/or becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the city shall notify the owner by registered or certified mail, or by delivery in person of a notice of violation. The notice shall specify the measures needed to bring the stormwater management system into compliance with this article and shall specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. Failure of the city to provide such notice shall not relieve the owner from performing proper maintenance and inspection of the stormwater management system. A failure by the owner to comply with the notice is a violation of this article.
(4)
Inspection programs by the city may be established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to routine inspections, random inspections, inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations, and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to, reviewing maintenance and repair records, sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in stormwater management systems, and evaluating the condition of those systems.
(d)
Records of maintenance activities. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management system shall maintain records of all maintenance and repairs and provide copies to the department upon request.
(e)
Failure to maintain. If an owner is in breach of subsections (a), (b), (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, the city, after 30 days written notice (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24 hours notice shall be sufficient), may correct any violation by performing the necessary work to place the stormwater management system in proper working condition. The city may assess the owner of the system for the cost of repair work which shall be a lien on the property, and may be placed on the ad valorem tax bill for such property and collected in the ordinary manner for such taxes.

Alternative #4. The applicant shall comply with the following conditions:
(1)
Runoff reduction for the first 1.0" of rainfall at an off-site facility or regional stormwater management facility using the following methods:
a.
the donation of conservation easements to the city, in a form approved by the city, that protect streams and stream buffers, floodplains, forested areas, or greenspace;
b.
purchase, reforestation, and dedication to the city, of floodplain properties, especially undevelopable and repetitive loss properties; or
c.
Vegetated green infrastructure, or rainwater harvesting and reuse installed on public or private property;
(2)
The location of the off-site facility must be chosen according to the following order of preference:
a.
Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that receives runoff from the original construction activity;
b.
Locations serviced by the combined sewer system;
c.
Locations within the same catchment area as the original construction activity;
d.
Locations within the next adjacent catchment area upstream;
e.
Locations anywhere within the city's jurisdiction; and
(3)
Development shall use a stormwater management system designed to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for Runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event minus the volume treated using runoff reduction.
(h)
When all conditions are fulfilled within a particular alternative, the process is complete, and that alternative becomes the stormwater management standard from section 74-513(a) for the development.

Sec. 74-525. - Stormwater master plans.
(a)
Development of a site that is proposed to be carried out in two or more phases extending over multiple years, under more than one permit, may be subject to a stormwater master plan approved by the commissioner.
(b)
A master plan is a principle framework for the management of runoff with respect to development on the site.
(c)
A master plan may be approved by the commissioner at the same time a permit first triggers the application of this article. The Commissioner must be satisfied that the master plan demonstrates that the provisions of this article at the time of approval of the master plan, are capable of being complied with once all phases of the development are complete, even if this article cannot be complied with at a particular phase of the development. The commissioner may impose conditions on the master plan requiring identified stormwater management systems to be installed at a particular phase of the development.
(d)
No phase or part of a phase of a development shall be approved if the construction of that phase or part of a phase results in an increase in runoff above the existing rate prior to the permit that first triggers the application of this article.
(e)
The department must monitor the implementation of a master plan to ensure that on completion of the development, the master plan results in the site complying with the terms of this article. To assist in this evaluation the applicant or owner shall submit an annual report showing the progress towards meeting the requirements of this article when compared to the implementation of the master plan.
(f)
For a site that is subject to an approved master plan, the owner must enter into any operation and maintenance agreement when such an agreement is first triggered by the provisions of this article. The agreement must be recorded over all parcels of land that comprise the master plan, whether or not a stormwater management system is located on such a parcel. The owner will be required to update the agreement for each phase of the development.
(g)
For each permit that triggers that the requirements of this article (after the initial permit which approves the master plan), the applicant or owner must provide a copy of the approved master plan and provide a narrative explaining how the current phase of the development is in compliance with the terms of the master plan, and detail any impact of the current phase on past and future phases of the development.
(h)
A master plan may be amended by the commissioner on application in writing by the applicant or owner.
