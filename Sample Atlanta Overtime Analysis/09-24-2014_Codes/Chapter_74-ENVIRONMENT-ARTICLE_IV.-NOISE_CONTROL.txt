(Ord. No. 2013-03(12-O-0774), § 1(Attach. A), 1-31-13)
Sec. 74-135. - Sound measurement procedures.
(a)
Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and, as necessary, at other conditions, including but not limited to, design, maximum, and fluctuating rates. All noise measurements shall be made as directed in this article. When instrumentation cannot be placed at or within the property line, the measurement shall be made as close thereto as is reasonable. For the purposes of this article, noise measurements are measured on the A- or C-weighting scale, as applicable, of a sound level meter (SLM) of standard design and quality having characteristics established by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
(b)
All tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures:
(1)
The NCO shall, to the extent practicable, identify all sources contributing sound to the point of measurement but shall not be required to document the absence of such sources or document that such sources would not have caused the test to be valid.
(2)
Measurements for comparison of the ambient sound level of a sound source to the background noise level shall be taken at the nearest receiving property line. When a measurement is being taken to determine whether the noise source is in violation of the absolute cap set forth in section 74-136(a)(1) (Table 2) or section 74-136(a)(2), the measurement shall also be taken at the nearest receiving property line. Where a violation is perceived by an NCO to be occurring absent a report of noise disturbance from nearby properties, or the nearest receiving property line is not readily apparent or accessible, the NCO may take such measurements from the public right-of-way adjacent to the property from which the noise source originates.
(3)
The SLM must be calibrated using a calibrator or method recommended by the SLM manufacturer and in the manner recommended. Automatic internal calibration of the SLM which occurs as a part of the initialization of the SLM shall be sufficient to satisfy this requirement.
(4)
The SLM shall be recertified and/or recalibrated as recommended by the manufacturer.
(5)
Unless the manufacturers' specifications allow adjustments to be made to compensate for the following factors, no outdoor measurements shall be taken:
a.
During periods when wind speeds (including gusts) exceed 15 mph;
b.
Without a windscreen, recommended by the SLM manufacturer, properly attached to the SLM;
c.
Under any condition that allows the SLM to become wet; or
d.
When the ambient temperature is out of the range of the tolerance of the SLM;
e.
Provided however that it shall not be necessary to document the absence of the conditions set forth in this subsection for a reading to be valid.
(c)
The report for each measurement session should include such facts as may be necessary to demonstrate that a violation has occurred, whether established by data captured by the SLM or supplied by a separate written report or testimony of a police officer or NCO but the absence of a written determination of any particular fact at the time of citation shall not invalidate the overall finding if it can reasonably proven at the time set for adjudication of the citation.
(1)
The date, day of the week, and times at which measurements are taken;
(2)
The times of calibration;
(3)
The weather conditions;
(4)
The identification of all monitoring equipment by manufacturer, model number, and serial number;
(5)
The normal operating cycle of the sources in question with a description of the sources provided however that where the sources in question do not have a normal operating cycle, such notation shall not be required;
(6)
The ambient sound level, in dB(A) or (C), depending on the measurement being taken, with the sources in question operating;
(7)
The background sound level, in dB(A), without the sources in question operating provided however that where the background sound level in question cannot reasonably be measured, the correction factor for background sound levels shall be three dB(A);
(8)
The total accumulative time duration of the monitoring session; and
(9)
A description of the measurement site, including measurement locations and relevant distances and other information sufficient for another investigator to repeat the measurements under similar conditions. Photographs which contain sufficient information for another investigator to repeat the measurements under similar conditions may be substituted at the discretion of the NCO; and
(10)
Information required to support the issuance of a citation shall be considered sufficient if the data captures SLM provides such information, and/or such information can be provided by the citation and/or the testimony of the NCO taking such readings and/or such other reports generated by the NCO or any police officer.
(d)
Prior to taking noise measurements, the NCO shall reasonably explore the vicinity of the source in question to identify any other sound sources that could affect measurements, to establish the approximate location and character of the principal sound source, and to select suitable locations from which to measure the sound from the source in question. Unless the reasonable exploration of the site uncovers a condition that could affect the measurements, the NCO shall not be required to make a notation that this subsection has been satisfied.
(e)
When measuring continuous sound, or sound that is sustained for more than one second at a time, the SLM shall be set for the appropriate A or C weighting, slow meter response speed, and the range (if the SLM is designed to read levels over different ranges of (SPLs) shall be set to that range in which the meter reads closest to the maximum end of the scale). When the measured sound level is variable or fluctuating over a range greater than three DBA, using the slow meter response speed, the fast meter response speed shall be used. In either case, both the minimum and maximum readings shall be recorded to indicate the range of monitored values.
(f)
The SLM shall be placed at a minimum height of three feet above the ground or from any reflective surface. When handheld, the microphone shall be held at arm's length and pointed at the source at the angle recommended by the SLM manufacturer.
(g)
If extraneous sound sources, such as aircraft flyovers or barking dogs that are unrelated to the measurements increase the monitored sound levels, the measurements should be postponed until these extraneous sounds have become of such a level as not to increase the monitored sound levels of interest.
(h)
The monitoring session should last for a period of time sufficient to ensure that the sound levels measured are typical of the source in question, but in no event shall the duration of testing be less than one minute.
(i)
The background sound levels shall be subtracted from the measured sound levels of the source of interest by using Table 1 to determine the sound levels from the source of interest alone. If the ambient sound level is less than three DBA higher than the background sound level, the source level cannot be derived and a violation of the article cannot be substantiated.
(j)
Information on the procedures required to support the issuance of a citation shall be considered sufficient if the SLM provides such information, and/or such information can be provided by the citation and/or the testimony of the NCO performing the test and/or such other reports generated by the NCO or any police officer.

Sec. 74-136. - Sound level limitations.
It shall be unlawful and a violation of this Code to exceed the following sound level limitations:
(a)
No person shall cause; allow, or permit the operation of any noise source on a particular category of property or any public property or right-of-way in such a manner as to create a sound level that exceeds the background sound level by ten dBA or more during daytime hours or five dBA or more during nighttime hours when measured within the real property line of a receiving property, except as provided in section 74-138. Such a noise would constitute a noise disturbance under this article if it continues in excess of one minute unless otherwise provided herein, provided however that no violation can be substantiated unless the background noise level is: at least Leq. 35 dBA (one min.) during daytime hours or Leq. 30 dBA (one min.) during nighttime hours in residential areas; at least Leq. 60 dBA (one min.) during daytime hours or Leq. 55 dBA (one min.) during nighttime hours in commercial areas; at least Leq. 65 dBA (one min.) during daytime hours or Leq. 60 dBA (one min.) during nighttime hours in industrial areas; and further provided however that this limitation shall not apply inside of multifamily dwelling unit buildings. If background noise levels are below the stated level to be used for comparison, the stated level shall be used.
(1)
If the background sound level cannot be determined, the absolute sound level limits set forth in Table 2 shall be used. The classification of property as set forth in Table 2 represents the receiving property and is not intended to increase the level of any sound produced by referencing the classification of the property producing the sound in question. For the purpose of this article, the representation of the person registering a complaint shall be sufficient for the NCO to determine the category of the receiving property if it is not readily apparent from an observation of the receiving property. In those cases where an NCO is making a measurement not based on the complaint of an individual but is conducting an investigation based on the recommendation from a police officer or the NCO's own investigation, the observation of the NCO shall be sufficient to determine the category for the measurement of the receiving property.

  (2)
At no time shall noise levels be produced that exceed 65 dB(C) Leq (one min.) at a receiving real property line.
(3)
If the noise source, measured at a receiving property line, is a pure tone, then the sound level limitations set forth in Table 2 shall be reduced by five dB.
(4)
Impulsive sound sources shall not exceed 100 dB(C) Leq. measured at a receiving property line, using the fast meter response speed.
(5)
Inside multifamily dwelling unit buildings, if the background sound level cannot be determined, the limit during daytime hours is 45 dB(C) Leq (one min.) and the limit during nighttime hours is 35 dB(C) Leq. for sounds originating in another dwelling within the same building. When the sound is generated from the heating, ventilation, air conditioning units or other machinery serving the premises, whether operated for the use of an individual dwelling unit or a group of dwelling units, the limit is 40 dB(C) Leq (one min.) for both daytime and nighttime hours.
(b)
At the discretion of a police officer and as an alternative to making a determination based upon the ambient sound level or absolute sound level, the following standards shall be used for sounds emanating from any noise source located on any residential property, commercial property, or public property:
(1)
During daytime hours, sound emanating from any noise source shall be limited in volume, tone and intensity so that the sound shall not be plainly audible to any person at a distance of 200 or more feet from the real property line of any private property on which the noise source is located, or from any noise source located on any public property or public right-of-way; provided however that under no circumstance shall the existence of this standard prevent a violation from being found if the sound is measured as set forth in section 74-136(a). A violation of this subsection may also be established by observations made in the public right-of-way at the distance specified from the real property line of any private property or any public property on which the noise source is located.
(2)
During nighttime hours, sound emanating from any noise source shall be limited in volume, tone and intensity so that the sound shall not be plainly audible to any person at a distance of 50 or more feet from the real property line of any private property on which the noise source is located, or from any noise source located on any public property or public right-of-way; provided however that under no circumstance shall the existence of this standard prevent a violation from being found if the sound is measured as set forth in section 74-136(a). A violation of this subsection may also be established by observations made in the public right-of-way at the distance specified from the real property line of any private property or any public property on which the noise source is located.
(3)
The determination of the location of the real property line of any private property on which the noise source is located or the determination of the location of the public right-of-way line shall not be required to be made pursuant to the review of a survey or other document. In making the determination, any police officer or any NCO may use the appearance of the parcel where the noise source originates and the arrangement of the structures thereon as well as similar characteristics on surrounding parcels to make a determination as to the approximate location of the property line or may use the apparent limits of the public right-of-way adjacent to the parcel where the noise source originates.
(4)
The determination of the number of feet from the real property line of any private property on which the noise source is located, or from any noise source located on any public property or public right-of-way shall not require a measurement to be taken using electronic or mechanical means and it shall be sufficient if the NCO or the police officer is able to make a good faith determination that the minimum distance has been exceeded when the plainly audible determination is made.
(5)
In determining whether or not a sound emanating from a noise source violates this section, NCO's or police officers may consider the following factors:
a.
Level of the noise based upon reaction to it in the same manner as it would be experienced by a reasonable person;
b.
Nature of the noise on which the complaint is based;
c.
Origin of the noise based on required distance;
d.
Level and intensity of any background noise compared to the noise being investigated;
e.
Proximity of the noise to sleeping facilities;
f.
Nature and zoning of the area;
g.
Density of inhabitation in the area;
h.
Time of day or night the noise is occurring;
i.
Duration of the noise;
j.
Whether the noise is recurrent, intermittent, or constant, especially in cases where voluntary compliance is followed by a second complaint within any 24-hour period;
k.
Whether the noise is produced by a business operation and an SLM measurement is reasonably available pursuant to section 74-140A
l.
Whether voluntary compliance is obtained.
(6)
After having made a determination under this section that a noise violates this section, police officers may issue a citation for violation of this section but shall not be required to do so upon their determination that the level of plainly audible noise is not such as would disturb a reasonable person or is no greater than the level and intensity of any background noise compared to the noise being investigated.
(7)
Inside multifamily dwelling unit buildings, where it may not be possible to determine the distance from the sound source, NCO's or police officers shall determine whether the unit or area of the building producing the sound source is directly adjacent to the dwelling unit receiving the sound, in which case the owner of the sound source may be cited if after the consideration of the factors set forth in this section.

(2)
Compliance with the article would impose an unreasonable hardship on the applicant without some benefit to the public that will result from the completion of the activity requiring the variance.

(a)
Violation of any provision of this article shall be cause for a citation to be issued by a police officer or NCO according to procedures set forth in the City Code of Ordinances.

(Ord. No. 2013-03(12-O-0774), § 1(Attach. A), 1-31-13)
Sec. 74-140A. - Request for SLM reading for business operations.
(a)
The city recognizes the need to balance the level of noise associated with the reasonable and legal operation of businesses with the level of noise which is generally present in a highly populated urban environment and to provide for a method to assist businesses with understanding the noise levels which generate complaints. In furtherance of this policy, any business that is the subject of a complaint for which a citation could be issued under section 74-136(b) may request an SLM measurement by an NCO upon their reasonable belief that the noise level of their business operation would not be in violation of section 74-136(a) if an SLM reading was taken.
(b)
A request from a business for an SLM reading shall be deemed to be sufficient under this article if it is made at the time that an NCO or police officer appears at the premises to investigate a complaint under this article.
(1)
In the event that a police officer requests that an NCO take a reading, the business in question may continue operations until such reading is taken but it shall not remove the officer's discretion to issue a citation under section 74-136(b) if the business alters or ceases that part of the operation producing the noise to avoid the confirmation of a violation through the SLM reading and recommences operations within the next 12 hours.
(2)
A police officer who chooses not to issue a citation upon a good faith belief that the noise level of the business operation would not be in violation of this article if an SLM reading is taken by an NCO is not required to seek such reading unless requested by the business to determine whether they are in compliance.
(3)
A business must possess a valid business license to conduct the type of business being carried on at the location where the complaint arises before the option to permit SLM reading shall be considered. If a business license cannot be produced or the business operation does not have a valid business license, a police officer may issue a citation pursuant section 74-136(b) in addition to citation for any other violations of the City Code.
(c)
In the event that an SLM reading confirms a violation of this article, a citation shall be issued under section 74-136(a).
(d)
No police officer shall be required to honor a request for SLM reading if such request is made within 30 days after a citation for a violation of section 74-136(a) was issued unless the citation has been dismissed or the business can document that noise remediation efforts have been undertaken.
(e)
Where an SLM measurement is not reasonably available, no police officer or NCO shall be prevented from issuing a citation for a violation of section 74-136(b) but if the failure to conduct such SLM measurement is offered in defense of the citation, proof of the reasonableness of the decision not to conduct such SLM measurement shall be in the discretion of the municipal court. It is the intention of this section to allow SLM readings to be made available to a business whenever reasonably possible.
