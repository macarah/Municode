FOOTNOTE(S):
--- (6) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2013-20(13-O-1021), §§ 1—17, approved May 29, 2013, repealed the §§ 74-201—74-207, and enacted new §§ 74-201—74-209 as set out herein. The former sections 74-201—74-207 pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table.
Sec. 74-201. - Intent and disclaimer.
(a)
Intent. The intent of this article is to regulate and restrict uses and structures within both traditional and historically modified floodplain areas of the City of Atlanta in order to protect life and property, to prevent or minimize the hazards and damage which follow periods of severe inundation and to reduce the public cost of rescue efforts, relief efforts and flood control activities made necessary by such inundation; to protect the natural function and character of the traditional floodplain and surrounding areas; and to enable owners of property within the City of Atlanta to qualify for national flood insurance.
(b)
Disclaimer of liability. The Atlanta City Council finds the degree of flood protection required by this article to be reasonable and consistent with historically established and nationally accepted levels of protection based on scientific and engineering practices. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the floodway, traditional floodplain, historically modified floodplain, special flood hazard area, or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
(Ord. No. 2013-20(13-O-1021), § 1, 5-29-13)

(Ord. No. 2013-20(13-O-1021), § 3, 5-29-13)
Sec. 74-204. - Permits required.
(a)
Permit required. Use of lands and buildings, and construction, reconstruction, repair, modification or demolition of any structure within all floodplains, including special flood hazard areas, shall require review and approval of a permit by the commissioner.
(b)
Flood study or field run survey required. The Federal Emergency Management Agency flood maps, more particularly described in section 74-202, adopted by the city are used for general reference purposes only. A flood study or a field run survey may be required to determine the location and extent of the floodplain area on a specific parcel.
(i)
Flood study. In an unmapped floodplain or in a mapped floodplain where elevation has not been established, a flood study may be required in order to establish the base flood elevation. Such a flood study shall address, at a minimum, impact to upstream, downstream and adjacent properties, and the free flow of flood waters.
(ii)
Field run survey. In order to establish the horizontal extent of the vertical floodplain elevation, a field run survey may be required to establish the actual location of the limit when proposed development is proximate to the limits of a floodplain/floodway.
(iii)
A flood study or field run survey required under this subsection shall be certified by either a professional engineer or registered land surveyor.
(c)
Review and approval. Any proposal which includes any of the activities described in this article shall be submitted to the commissioner for review before any such activity is commenced. The commissioner may authorize the approval of any of such activities upon a finding, based on detailed plans and specifications submitted with the proposal, that the activity can be completed and occupied or used in full compliance with the requirements of this article. No part of any such activity shall be commenced before such permit approval has been issued and all other permits and licenses required by applicable law have been issued or obtained.
(d)
Permit revocation. The commissioner may recommend the revocation of any such permit when the commissioner determines the activity is not being accomplished, or that the land is not being used or occupied, as shown on the plans and specifications approved by the commissioner. A permit approval so revoked may be reinstated upon application by the holder under such rules and conditions as are established by the commissioner consistent with the requirements of this article and other applicable laws.
(e)
Protection of existing flood storage and from flooding. The commissioner shall not, by authorizing the approval of a permit under the authority of this article, authorize any use of land, any extension or enlargement of a use of land which existed before the original date of enactment of the provisions of said article, or the commencement of any of the activities described in this article, where the effect thereof would be to decrease the volume of existing flood storage on that land or to increase flooding conditions upstream, downstream or adjacent to that land.
(i)
Protection of floodways. The floodway shall be that as defined in the flood insurance study, City of Atlanta, Georgia, Fulton and DeKalb County, Federal Emergency Management Agency, revised June 22, 1998, and as it may be subsequently revised or extended. On those watercourses and rivers regulated hereunder where the floodway has not been defined in the said flood insurance study and until such time as these watercourses and rivers are defined in an officially adopted or revised flood insurance study, the floodway shall be defined as the channel of the watercourse or river and the adjacent areas of the defined or undefined floodplain that must be reserved in order to discharge the 100-year base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot upstream of, downstream of, or at the point being considered. No fill or encroachments shall be placed within the defined floodway that would impair the ability to carry and discharge the waters resulting from the 100-year base flood.
(ii)
Floodplain protection. The commissioner shall not authorize the approval of any permit authorizing the placement of fill or stored materials, or the construction of any building or other structure within the floodplain. Earth-disturbing activities in the floodplain shall be permitted only when the resulting configuration shall allow stormwater to enter the floodway by sheet flow (not channelized flow) and results in no loss of existing flood volume. Any earth-disturbing activities within a floodplain shall be subject to requirements of stream bank buffer limits and should be constructed using best management practices for soil erosion and sedimentation control. The use of compensating excavation or contouring; procedures to modify flood hazard limits may only apply to install necessary public roadway and utilities within the flood limits to support existing and new property(s) which are not within the flood limits.
All applications for permits issued by the commissioner which would allow any use or construction wholly or partly in a special flood hazard area shall include detailed plans and specifications which demonstrate that no expansion of a special flood hazard area would result from the work which would be authorized by any such permit. No such permit shall authorize any proposed use or construction which would have a finished elevation less than two feet higher than the nearest base flood elevation and that would be closer than 15 feet from the nearest base flood elevation, and no such permit shall be issued until the plans and specifications submitted are in compliance with this article and have been authorized by the commissioner. Any comments or requirements endorsed on such plans and specifications or on an addendum thereto, by the commissioner shall become a part of any permit issued for the work covered by the plans and specifications and shall be enforced as are all other requirements applicable to such permit.
(iii)
Reserved.
(iv)
Modification to existing structures or existing usages of the floodplain in violation of, but predating the provisions of this article. Minor modifications and routine maintenance of uses and structures which were lawful prior to the original date of enactment of the provisions of this article, including existing structures, fills, pavements, utilities, manufactured homes, mobile homes, mobile home sites and other facilities, shall be subject to the following restrictions:
(A)
Permitted modifications of existing structures or existing usage. Any modification to an existing usage, when such existing usage is in violation of this article, that enhances the protection of life or property or which is reasonably necessary to the maintenance and upkeep of the property concerned and which does not extend the scope and magnitude of the existing violation of these regulations, is permitted provided the value of such modification or maintenance does not exceed 50 percent of the value of the structure or total existing usage prior to such modification or maintenance, excluding the value of the land but including the value of existing structures, utility service connections, fills, pavements, slabs, mobile home sites and other facilities which can be reasonably demonstrated as an integral part of that existing usage.
(B)
Modifications requiring additional measures. Any improvement, modification or maintenance and any repairs or reconstruction required by any reason, including damages arising from normal deterioration, flood, other natural act or accident, of any existing usage where such existing usage is in violation of this article, shall bring that existing usage under the scope of the regulations set forth in this subsection; and that existing usage shall be brought into compliance with this article, providing that the total value of such improvement, modification, maintenance, repair or reconstruction exceeds 50 percent of the value of the structure or existing usage before such improvement, modification or maintenance or before such flood, other natural act or accident, excluding the value of the land but including the prior value of structures, utility service connections, fills, pavements, slabs, mobile home sites and other facilities which can be reasonably demonstrated as an integral part of the existing usage prior to the event.

Sec. 74-209. - Indemnity agreements.
The city finds that the construction of new structures, the elevation and flood protecting of existing structures, the installation of a swimming pool or other in-ground water features, or the construction of a parking lot in a special flood hazard area generally will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. However, as stated in Atlanta City Code section 74-201(b), such improvements may be subject to inundation under certain conditions. Therefore, prior to the issuance of any permit for construction of a new structure, the elevation of an existing structure, the installation of a swimming pool or other in-ground water feature, or the construction of a parking lot in a special flood hazard area, the owner of the subject property shall execute an indemnification and hold harmless agreement, in a form provided by the city, which shall state at a minimum, that owner shall indemnify and hold harmless the city for any damages or claims for damages, suits, costs, judgments losses, and injuries arising out of the owner's construction, maintenance, use or removal of said improvements. The indemnification shall be filed and recorded in the land records of the county in which the property lies and shall be a permanent covenant running with the land and shall be binding upon the successors in title of the owner.
