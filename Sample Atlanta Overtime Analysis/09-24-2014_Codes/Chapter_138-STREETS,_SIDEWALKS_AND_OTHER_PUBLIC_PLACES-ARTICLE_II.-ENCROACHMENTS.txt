Sec. 138-22. - Nonconforming encroachments.
(a)
Structure or properties that encroach into public right-of-way and for which there is not an applicable agreement shall be considered "nonconforming uses." The city may, at the discretion of the commissioner of public works, permit certain nonconforming encroachments. The city may at any time determine that continued encroachment is not in the public interest and may require the removal of said encroachment.
(b)
If a nonconforming encroachment ceases to have continuous use, has a change in the type or degree of use, or if the structural or functional soundness of the structure or property deteriorates due to lack of maintenance, damage by fire, flood, wind, or other act of God, it shall no longer be tolerated and shall not be eligible for repair, replacement, or further use until an encroachment agreement has been executed. The city shall have the right and duty to require the removal of any encroachment thus affected.

(Ord. No. 2001-22, § 1, 3-14-01)
Sec. 138-23. - Obligation to relocate upon notice.
(a)
The city reserves the right to perform any public works or public improvements necessary to maintain the public right-of-way. The city may therefore, upon written request to the permittee, require relocation of the permittee's facilities existing in the public right-of-way at the permittee's own expense when the relocation is necessary to maintain the health, safety, or welfare of the public or to improve or maintain the public right-of-way for transportation uses.
(1)
Notification, failure to remove. Upon receiving written notice from the city to remove, or relocate facilities which are using or occupying a public right-of-way which the city has to improve, the permittee shall, within 60 days thereafter, begin arrangements for said removal or relocation in accordance with said written notice from the city. Should the permittee fail to comply with such notice within a reasonable time sufficient to allow for procedures reasonably necessary for the removal and relocation of the facilities, the city may give the permittee a final notice directing that such removal begin not later than ten days from the receipt of such final notice.
(2)
Removal or relocation of facilities by the city. If the permittee refuses or neglects to relocate said facilities existing in the public right-of-way within ten days of receipt of such final notice, or if an emergency affecting public safety or health exists requiring immediate relocation of the permittee's facilities, to the extent not inconsistent with state and federal law, the city may relocate such facilities and the permittee shall pay to the city the reasonable costs incurred in connection with such relocation.
(3)
Removal or relocation of facilities for aesthetic purposes. If the relocation of facilities in the right-of-way is for aesthetic purposes or purposes not related to improving the public right-of-way for transportation purposes or to maintain the public right-of-way for health or safety reasons, then the cost of such relocation shall be borne by the requesting third party and not by the city or the permittee.
(4)
Removal or relocation of facilities by an act of God. If an act of God necessitates the relocation of the permittee's facilities located in the public rights-of-way, the cost of such relocation shall not be borne by the permittee.

Sec. 138-62. - Bike sharing infrastructure.
(a)
Purpose and intent.
(1)
The public health, safety and welfare will be enhanced by the implementation of a self service bicycle rental program also known as citywide bike share program ("program" or "system") of the type generally set forth in "The Atlanta-Decatur Bike Share Feasibility Study" ("Atlanta-Decatur Study") published in January 2013 by the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition. The program, which will establish bike sharing infrastructure, both in the public right-of-way and on private property in the City of Atlanta ("city"), and which will be fully paid for by one or more vendors ("providers") selected by the city, will accomplish the city's goals of establishing a positive and useful program for the general public while eliminating city costs and expenses if the city were to directly implement the program.
(2)
The location of bike share infrastructure on public property is intended to increase utilization of other transit modes by providing a first mile and last mile travel alternative that will increase the range of destinations served.
(3)
The bike sharing experience of the general public as set forth in the Atlanta-Decatur Study will be enhanced by the ability of the city to contract with providers to install and manage bike share infrastructure on public property including the public right-of-way for the installation around the city of multiple rental stations ("stations" or "kiosks") that house rental bicycles ("bicycles").
(4)
The system will allow the general public to rent bicycles from stations located around the city, use a bicycle for trips of varying times and durations and return the bicycle to a different station. Such programs provide a convenience for residents, workers and visitors because Bicycles are available on an as-needed basis and are available for one-way trips. The program, made available by the city, can operate on a cooperative basis and link with other programs sponsored by other entities to grow the system quickly and expand the reach of the program beyond the city.
(b)
Definitions. The words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. The use of capitalized abbreviated reference terms for the definitions contained herein are intended to refer to the terms and phrases from which they were derived.

(c)
Authorization to allow the use of public property and right-of-way for the program.

The permit and the review of the criteria required in this section to obtain the endorsement of the SAP by the commissioner of planning shall be in addition to and shall in no way modify or replace the requirements set forth in the Zoning Ordinance and all permits required therein.
(3)
Before a permit for a station to be located on private property can be approved, the applicant must submit design plans, to be accompanied by photographs and any other required supporting documents, to the commissioner of planning for approval. The submitted design plans for stations located on private property must also comply with the same restrictions related to the location and placement of the stations installed in the public right-of-way as described immediately above in subsection 138-62 (d).

Such insurance requirements shall be set out in the encroachment agreement that must be agreed to and executed by the provider.
(g)
Provider responsible for condition of public property. All stations located on public property are installed at the risk of the provider who shall at all times have the obligation to return the public property on which the station is located back to the city in the same condition as when the encroachment agreement was entered into. In this regard, bond requirements as set out in the encroachment agreement must be complied with by the provider.
(h)
City held harmless. The provider shall hold the city harmless against all losses or damages resulting from or alleged to have resulted from the installation, and/or existence, and/or maintenance operation or any other aspect of the operation and use of the stations and the bicycles.
