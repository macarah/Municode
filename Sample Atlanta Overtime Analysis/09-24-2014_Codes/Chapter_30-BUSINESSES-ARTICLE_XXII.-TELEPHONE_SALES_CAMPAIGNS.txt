(a)
It shall be unlawful for any person, in such person's own name or in the name or for the benefit of any other person or organization, to conduct any sales campaign or sales promotion of any nature whatsoever by use of the telephone without first obtaining a permit from the mayor after recommendation of the license review board made at a regularly scheduled meeting of the license review board.
(b)
Such permit shall be valid for one year and may be renewed by the police chief or the chief's designee. If the police chief, upon application, fails to renew the permit, the applicant shall be authorized to appeal the denial of the permit to the license review board within 20 days of the permit holder's receipt of written notice from the police chief.
(c)
The license review board shall conduct the hearing referenced in subsections (a) and (b) above at a regularly scheduled meeting of the license review board and report its conclusions and recommendations to the mayor. The mayor, upon receiving the recommendation of the license review board, may, within 60 calendar days of receipt of said recommendation, deny or grant an application for a new permit, or grant the renewal of an expired permit. In addition, within said 60-day period, if the mayor determines there is a need to correct a clear error or prevent a manifest injustice, the mayor may remand the application or matter back to the license review board for further hearing. If the mayor fails to take action within the 60-day period, the recommendation of the license review board shall become the final decision of the mayor.
