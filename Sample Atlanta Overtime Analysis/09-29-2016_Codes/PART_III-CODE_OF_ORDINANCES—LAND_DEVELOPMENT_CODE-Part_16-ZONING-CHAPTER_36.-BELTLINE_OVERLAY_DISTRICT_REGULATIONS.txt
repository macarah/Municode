CHAPTER 36. - BELTLINE OVERLAY DISTRICT REGULATIONS

Sec. 16-36.001. - Scope of regulations.
The scope of the regulations set forth in this chapter are the regulations in the BeltLine Overlay District. These regulations are as follows:
1.
The existing zoning map and underlying zoning regulations governing all properties within the BeltLine Overlay District shall remain in full force and effect. The regulations contained within this chapter shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, said existing zoning regulations with the exception of existing lots of record that are zoned R-1 through R-5 or Special Public Interest District and not located immediately adjacent to the BeltLine Corridor. Except where it is otherwise explicitly provided, whenever the following overlay regulations are at variance with said existing underlying zoning regulations, the regulations of this chapter shall apply.
2.
Whenever the following regulations are at variance with historic district regulations of Part 16, Chapter 20, the more stringent regulations shall apply with the exception of regulations specific to the Beltline Corridor whereas not to impact designated historic structures or buildings.
(Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(Att. A), 2-28-07)
Sec. 16-36.002. - Findings, purpose and intent.
The BeltLine is a major initiative to link green space, trails, transit and economic development in Atlanta serving as a catalyst for transformative growth and investment encircling the urban core of the city by invigorating an underutilized rail corridor and surrounding underutilized industrial properties to create a better connected, more diversified city where people across the spectrum of age, income, ethnicity, and culture can live, work, shop, meet, and play.
The BeltLine represents a unique opportunity: to enhance the quality of life in the city; preserve and revitalize existing neighborhoods; make greater mixed-use development feasible; strategically introduce or increase density and optimize resources in select locations; increase the affordable housing inventory; promote air quality; reduce auto dependency; and concurrently advance economic development through an increased tax base.
The city finds that taking special consideration to ensure that the redevelopment of properties adjacent to and within walking distance of the BeltLine Corridor entails a compatible mixture of residential, commercial, cultural and recreational uses, and design standards conceptualized in the BeltLine Redevelopment Plan is crucial to promote and ensure the public health, safety and welfare of its citizens. The city recognizes that as the BeltLine attracts new development, the orientation and character of that growth should encourage pedestrian and transit-oriented uses and activities designed to support an urban character to foster the most positive impact on affected communities. By establishing the BeltLine Overlay District, the city intends to institute a regulatory approach that anticipates, manages, and encourages quality BeltLine development opportunities and impacts. Therefore, policies to promote these objectives within the BeltLine Overlay Zoning area will serve to:
1.
Implement certain recommendations contained in the comprehensive study known as the BeltLine Redevelopment Plan as adopted by the City of Atlanta;
2.
Preserve a continuous corridor along the BeltLine route of sufficient dimension for the implementation of transit, multi-use trails and green space;
3.
Promote and maximize opportunities for safe and accessible green spaces, plazas, public art, and cultural and institutional buildings;
4.
Preserve opportunities for connecting trails reaching beyond the BeltLine to create a broad network of trails throughout the city;
5.
Encourage a grid of smaller blocks and connected streets to improve access to the BeltLine, reduce congestion, and further the urban character of the area;
6.
Preserve the historic physical character of the industrial districts along the BeltLine by promoting adaptive re-use of historic structures and encouraging new construction to be consistent with the size, scale and/or character of those buildings;
7.
Ensure that new construction is compatible with the character of existing established adjacent single-family neighborhoods;
8.
Create new mixed-use and commercial nodes at BeltLine station areas that are pedestrian and transit-oriented;
9.
Create a diversified urban environment where people can live, work, shop, meet and play;
10.
Promote public health and safety by providing a pedestrian-oriented environment that includes active street-level uses, sufficient sidewalk widths, and primary pedestrian access from sidewalks to adjacent building entrances;
11.
Promote development of a wide range of housing types appropriate to meet various housing needs and income levels;
12.
Facilitate safe, pleasant and convenient pedestrian and bicycle circulation and minimize conflict between pedestrians and alternative transit modes;
13.
Provide accessible and sufficient parking in an unobtrusive manner by encouraging shared parking solutions and minimizing commercial parking in residential neighborhoods;
14.
Maximize air and water quality, including that which supports tree planting, greenspace and watershed protection, and bicycle parking;
15.
Improve the aesthetics of street and built environments.

Sec. 16-36.003. - Boundaries.
The boundaries of the BeltLine Overlay District shall be as shown on the official zoning map Attachment B adopted herewith entitled "BeltLine Overlay District." Any future property in which any portion of said property is located within the boundary of the BeltLine Overlay District shall be subject to the full regulations set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(Att. A), 2-28-07)
Sec. 16-36.004. - Procedures.
1.
Rezoning—Pre-application: In addition to the current rezoning procedures, any applications for rezoning within the BeltLine Overlay District subject area will begin with a pre-application consultation between the applicant and the bureau of planning as set by the bureau of planning.
2.
Special administrative permit requirement and procedures: A special administrative permit (SAP) application and a specified number of copies of each site plan, landscape plan and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the director of the bureau of planning, under the requirements specified in section 16-25.004, prior to the issuance of a building permit.
In addition to SAP submittal as specified above, the applicant shall also provide to the director of the bureau of planning a United States Postal Service certificate of mailing (first-class) of one copy of the full SAP application to the appropriate Neighborhood Planning Unit (NPU) chair or their designee for the purpose of notification and comment, and also a signed affidavit of said NPU notification. Said appropriate NPU shall have a period of 21 days from the date of the said certificate of mailing to provide one set of written comments to the bureau of planning prior to any SAP approval.
All exterior demolition, new construction (including additions to existing buildings), expansions of outdoor dining or any construction which results in increased lot coverage, modification of the building footprint, or modification of building façades that alters the configuration of openings, shall be subject to said site plan and building elevation approval as part of the SAP.
Any subdivisions, consolidations and replats shall conform to any proposed City of Atlanta future street plans in addition to the requirement of Part 15 of the City Code. When a conflict arises between Part 15 and this chapter, the requirements of this chapter shall apply.
Where the proposed development may require one or more special administrative permits, processing by the director of the bureau of planning shall include consideration of such special administrative permits. Where underlying regulations require variance, special exception or special use permit action, the special administrative permit shall not be issued until the necessary approval has been obtained.
3.
Exemptions from the special administrative permit requirement: Existing lots of record that have an underlying zoning designation of R-1 through R-5 or Special Public Interest (SPI) and not located immediately adjacent to the BeltLine Corridor shall be used and constructed as is otherwise permitted pursuant to the provisions of Part 16 and shall not require the obtaining of a special administrative permit (SAP) except as required by the underlying zoning district.
Any interior renovations or exterior repairs not explicitly set forth shall not require SAP approval. Said classes of special administrative permit applications may be exempted from detailed review requirements upon written findings that generally within these districts, the actions proposed are of such a character or of such a scale as to make detailed reviews and approval by the planning director unnecessary. Where applications for special administrative permits are determined by reference to such findings to be thus exempted, the permit shall be issued if otherwise lawful.
(Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(Att. A), 2-28-07)
Sec. 16-36.005. - Provisions for administrative variations from regulations.
As part of general action when plans require approval of a special administrative permit, the director of the bureau of planning may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings that either:
1.
A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accord with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree; or
2.
In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at the time or in the future.
Notation concerning the existence of such variation shall be made by written findings of SAP approval to be filed in the office of the bureau of buildings as public record. Variances and special exceptions from underlying zoning regulations shall be required from the board of zoning adjustment (BZA) in cases such as minimum yards (not adjacent to the street), minimum transitional yards, minimum open spaces, maximum building height, maximum fence height, minimum parking and loading requirements and signage limitations among others.
