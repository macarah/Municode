On sizes two (2) inches and smaller, a bronze strainer with 20-mesh stainless steel screen shall be installed between the first shut-off valve and the BFP head. On sizes larger than two (2) inches a strainer shall be used where required by the Administrative Authority.
A.
When the reduced pressure zone (RPZ) device is installed in a line subject to periodic no-flow conditions and the supply pressure is subject to periodic pressure dips, an auxiliary directional check valve with soft-disc shall be installed between the inlet shut-off valve and the BFP head. Makeup lines to chilled water systems and hydronic heating systems are examples of such installations.
EXCEPTION: The auxiliary directional check valve will not be required when a water pressure reducing valve is installed in the same line with RPZ device and the reducing valve is located upstream of the device.
B.
The two shut-off valves that are necessary for periodic testing of a backflow preventer need not be attached directly to the inlet and the outlet connections of the device. They may be installed remotely from the backflow preventer provided such relocations do not interfere with the normal testing of the device and provided there are no intervening connections between the backflow preventer and the valves.

Section 1300. - Potable Rainwater Catchment Systems

1300.1. - Preliminary Information.
(a)
An individual seeking to install a potable rainwater catchment system for single-family residential use shall request approval from the City of Atlanta. A building official or inspector shall recognize the installation of potable rainwater catchment systems in accordance with this appendix. The Bureau of Buildings, Chief Plumbing Inspector may maintain a list of registered City of Atlanta contractors and laboratories that may be contacted with specific technical questions regarding potable rainwater catchment systems and treatment. Maintenance of said list shall not constitute a warranty or create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any injury or damages that result from reliance on this list.
(b)
Rainwater catchment systems used for potable water applications present potential risks if not installed, maintained and properly operated. The City of Atlanta does not oversee the maintenance and therefore safety of private potable water systems. It is the sole responsibility of the owner of the system to maintain and use the system in a safe and responsible manner. This appendix is intended to set out construction standards dealing with the initial installation of the system components, recommended materials, water treatment and frequency of water testing. Following the standards of this appendix will improve the quality of the water collected and help the installer recognize potential safety problems. The proper system design, maintenance and use are the responsibility of the building owner. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any damages or injury that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
(c)
Building owner shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City of Atlanta, its agents and employees from and against any and all liabilities, claims, losses, lawsuits, judgments and/or expenses including attorney fees, arising, either directly or indirectly, from any act or failure to act by the City of Atlanta or any of its officers or employees, that occur during or arise from the rainwater catchment systems for potable and non-potable uses in residential areas. The building owner understands that he/she is choosing to harvest rainwater for potable and/or non-potable uses at his/her own risk.
(d)
The applicant shall provide an agreement holding the City of Atlanta harmless for liability for the construction and maintenance of said rainwater catchment system, and the owner shall record the agreement in land records of the county or counties in which the property is located that assigns all legal responsibility to the owners for construction and maintenance of said rainwater catchment system.
(e)
As used in this Section 1300, the term "Single-Family Residential" means one-family dwelling or single family dwelling as defined in Atlanta Zoning Ordinance Section 16-29.001(12)(a)(1), as amended, and includes a "Bed and Breakfast Inn," as defined in Atlanta Zoning Code Chapter 19, Section 19-29.001(78), as amended, with a potable rainwater catchment system installed prior to the effective date of this Section 1300. This Section 1300 shall become effective upon its approval by the mayor or upon its becoming law without such approval.

to install and maintain a meter on the supplies from the potable rainwater catchment system. Said owner or occupant shall instead be charged a flat annual sewer charge. Said flat annual charge shall be calculated by charging the lowest tier rate per 100 cubic foot of water usage. Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of the Department of Watershed Management that a significant portion of the water utilized from a customer's potable rainwater catchment system does not enter the City's wastewater system, then a 30 percent discount on the lowest tier rate shall be applied. For purposes of said flat annual sewer charge, 100 cubic feet of water usage shall be equivalent to 75 gallons of storage capacity in the potable rainwater catchment system's cistern and/or in-ground storage tank. For purposes of said flat annual sewer charge, storage capacity measurements shall be rounded to the nearest 75 gallon increment. Said flat annual sewer charge shall be in addition to any applicable base sewer service charge.

Sediment filtration of five microns or less shall be provided for reduction of contaminants that may mask bacteria or cloud the water before disinfection. All filters shall be of adequate size to extend service time. Cartridge filter elements shall be replaced as recommended by the manufacturer. All filters shall be NSF/ANSI 51: Food Equipment Materials (plastics, materials and components used in food equipment).
(c)
Carbon filtration shall be provided for improving taste and reduction of odor and organic chemicals. All filters shall be NSF/ANSI 51.
(d)
All filtration shall be installed before disinfection systems according to manufacturer's recommendations. Filtration and disinfection systems shall be located as close to the final point of use as possible.
(e)
Following the above filters an automatic disinfection device either chemical injection, ozone generators, or ultraviolet (UV) light shall be installed.
(f)
If ozone generators are used, provisions shall be made for venting per manufacturer recommendations.
(g)
UV light systems shall be sized based upon the maximum rated flow. UV lamps shall be maintained as per the manufacturers requirements but shall be replaced after not more than 10,000 hours of operation. UV light systems shall have a bulb life monitor that provides some indication when the bulb life is dying or dead. NSF/ANSI 55 standard for Class A UV treatment systems or units with comparable performance capabilities are recommended for UV light systems. Ozone generators or chorine pump injectors shall be sized and maintained as per the manufacturer's recommendation.

(b)
Testing for general water quality parameters at least every six months is recommended. Standard coliform tests for microbial contaminants are also recommended at least every six months. Potable rainwater catchment system owners should contact an approved analytical testing laboratory to learn the proper method of obtaining a sample for testing. If chemical disinfectants are used, chemical residual levels should be tested as recommended by the disinfection system manufacturer. Chemical testing for heavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, at a minimum) are also recommended at least once a year.
(c)
System owners shall remedy any failure of any water quality test. Until an approved analytical testing laboratory deems the potable rainwater catchment system safe, the system shall not be active. This includes reconnecting to the city water system until the potable rainwater catchment system passes subsequent general water quality parameter and coliform tests. A host of chemical contaminants can be found in collected rainwater from environmental sources, animal sources and from materials used in and around the neighborhood from which the rainwater is collected. Insects, animals, bacteria, viruses and parasites create potential sources of contamination of a water supply that is not properly serviced and maintained.
