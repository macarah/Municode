Sec. 16-28A.003. - Findings, purpose and intent.
The City of Atlanta finds that the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the city directly affect the public health, safety, and welfare. The city finds that signs have become excessive, and that many signs are distracting and dangerous to motorists and pedestrians, are confusing to the public and do not relate to the premises on which they are located, and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the city. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the City of Atlanta in enacting this chapter are as follows:
(1)
To protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Atlanta, and to implement the policies and objectives of the comprehensive development plan of the City of Atlanta through the enactment of a comprehensive set of regulations governing signs in the City of Atlanta.
(2)
To regulate the erection and placement of signs within the City of Atlanta in order to provide safe operating conditions for pedestrian and vehicular traffic without unnecessary and unsafe distractions to drivers or pedestrians.
(3)
To preserve the value of property on which signs are located and from which signs may be viewed.
(4)
To maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of established zoning districts.
(5)
To maintain for the city's residents, workers and visitors a safe and aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interests of the city.
(6)
To maintain and maximize tree coverage within the city.
(7)
To establish comprehensive sign regulations which effectively balance legitimate business and development needs with a safe and aesthetically attractive environment for residents, workers, and visitors to the city.
(8)
To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for the identification of businesses which are located within the City of Atlanta, and to provide for the identification of the availability of products, goods or services which are available upon site so as to promote the economic vitality of businesses which are located within the City of Atlanta.
(9)
To ensure the protection of free speech rights under the State and United States Constitutions within the City of Atlanta and in no event place restrictions that apply to any given sign dependent entirely on the communicative content of the sign.
(10)
To establish a permit system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts consistent with the uses, intent and aesthetic characteristics of those districts.
(11)
To allow certain signs that are small, safe, unobtrusive and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this chapter but without a requirement for permits.
(12)
To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances, without regard to the communicative content of the sign.
(13)
To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of said nonconforming signs.
(14)
To continue to encourage the display of public art as a vital part of the urban landscape, while imposing reasonable restrictions on such art in order to protect public safety and to avoid the abuse of a public art exemption as a means for evading the purpose and effect of these sign regulations.
(15)
To prohibit all signs not expressly authorized by this chapter, to provide for the maintenance of signs, and to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
(16)
To prohibit obscenity.

( Ord. No. 2015-54(15-O-1394), § 1(Att. A), 11-11-15 ; Ord. No. 2016-16(15-O-1409) , § 1, 6-15-16; Ord. No. 2017-50(17-O-1204), § 1, 9-5-17 )
Sec. 16-28A.005. - Scope of regulations.
It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, move, alter or convert any sign or cause the same to be done within the City of Atlanta except in accordance with the provisions of this chapter 28A.
( Ord. No. 2015-54(15-O-1394), § 1(Att. A), 11-11-15 )
Sec. 16-28A.006. - Computations.
(a)
Area of Sign Face and Distance Between Signs: All regulations involving the area of signs specified in this chapter 28A shall be interpreted to mean measurements of the sign face unless the context, text or usage clearly requires otherwise. All regulations involving distances from or between signs specified in this chapter 28A shall be interpreted to refer to any part of a sign, including both the sign structure and the sign face.
(b)
Computation of Sign Area of Individual Signs: The area of a sign shall be the total area within the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with the total area of any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets the regulations of Part 16 of the Code of Ordinances and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
(c)
Computation of Area of Multifaced Signs: Where the sign faces of a double-faced sign are parallel or the interior angle formed by the faces is 60 degrees or less, only one display face shall be measured in computing sign area. If the two faces of a double-face sign are of unequal area, the area of the sign shall be the area of the larger sign face. In all other cases, the areas of all sign faces of a multifaced sign shall be added together to compute the area of the sign.
(d)
Computation of Height of Sign: The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of (1) existing grade prior to construction, or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower.
( Ord. No. 2015-54(15-O-1394), § 1(Att. A), 11-11-15 )

(iii)
No flashing or animated sign shall extend over a public right-of-way.

(4)
Where buildings are set back along the front or side street to a depth greater than ten feet, such sign shall not be placed closer than ten feet to the property line; where buildings have setbacks less than ten feet such sign may be placed on the building wall or within the zone between the building wall and the street. No such sign shall be erected within ten feet of an interior side lot line.
(k)
[Reserved.]
(l)
[Reserved.]
(m)
Maximum Height of Signs: No portion of any sign shall extend above the top of the building upon which it is located. When attached to buildings over 30 feet in height, no portion of a sign shall be located more than 30 feet in height above ground level, provided that when the ground level is lower than the level of the adjoining street pavement, said sign may be raised so as to be not more than 20 feet above the level of the pavement.

(4)
The impact of the proposed cutting or pruning on Atlanta's urban forest environment.
(o)
Location of Freestanding Signs: Freestanding signs shall be located ten or more feet from the nearest wall of a principal structure and shall not project over the roof of any structure. If a building existing on the date of adoption of this chapter is located in such a way that there is no place on its lot that is more than ten feet from a wall of the building, and if a freestanding sign would otherwise be permitted on such lot, then the director shall permit a freestanding sign to be located nearer than ten feet to the building provided that such sign is kept as far as practicable from the building, does not result in an unsafe condition, and otherwise complies with the requirements of this part.
(p)
Building Signature Signs: Building signature signs where permitted by district regulations are subject to the following conditions unless otherwise modified by a more specific district regulation:
(1)
Only one building signature sign shall be allowed on any side elevation of the building and further provided that no building shall contain more than one such sign per side elevation.
(2)
Building signature signs may supersede the more restrictive height limit set forth in section 16-28A.007(m) including the 200 square foot area limitation imposed by the applicable zoning district.
(3)
Building signature signs are allowed only on buildings four or more stories in height provided no part of such sign shall extend above the top of the building.
(4)
The area of a building signature sign shall not exceed five percent of the area of the wall to which it is affixed, and shall not be included in computing the total area of signage imposed by each zoning district for other signs.
(5)
Building signature signs shall be allowed only for an owner or principal occupant as defined in section 16-28A.004. Changes in ownership or occupancy that result in non-compliance with this chapter shall require the removal of the subject sign.
(6)
[Reserved.]
(7)
Building signature signs are subject to the prohibition against roof signs. Walls erected on the roof of a building regardless of whether such wall projects above its top are not parapet walls and no such wall may be used as a building signature sign or to support a building signature sign.
(8)
An applicant seeking permission to erect a building signature sign shall provide notarized documentation that it has an ownership interest in the building or that it meets the conditions required to be considered a principal occupant and has permission from the owner to make the application. In determining the level of ownership necessary to qualify as an owner, the city presumes, based on the documentation required to be produced, that the applicant has made such arrangements with other claiming ownership interest as may be necessary to allow the applicant to claim that it may apply for the sign as an owner. As a part of the documentation, which may be, but is not required to be on a form supplied by the city, the applicant shall acknowledge and agree:
(i)
That neither the city nor its administrative officials are confirming whether the application is in conflict with the rights of others claiming ownership rights or others claiming to be principal occupants regardless of whether such claims are known or unknown;
(ii)
That the applicant has made the statements in the application subject to the state law penalties which apply to false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or entries in a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the government of a city;
(iii)
That the city and its administrative officials are relying on the sworn statements in the application in making its determination that the application meets the criteria set forth in this chapter;
(iv)
That the city and its administrative officials are authorized to audit the leases for a principal occupant to verify that the level of occupancy and length of the lease term meets the requirements of this chapter and that the applicant agrees to cooperate when requested to produce such documents.
(9)
The issuance of a sign permit pursuant to this chapter is limited to a determination that the application included the required documentation, that the building on which the sign is to be erected met the requirements of this chapter and that the sign erected or to be erected met the requirements of this chapter. Those determinations are, in part, based on the notarized documentation provided by the applicant concerning the allocation of private rights subject to contracts and/or leases with other parties and therefore the city's issuance of such permit:
(i)
Shall not be considered to be the decision of the city or any administrative official that such permit has the effect to determine, supersede, amend or modify private rights of ownership in any sign or in any building where such sign may be legally erected in that the city and its administrative officials are relying on the sworn representations of the applicant in issuing the permit; and
(ii)
Shall not be considered to be the decision of the city or any administrative official that such permit has the effect to determine, supersede, amend or modify the private rights created in or by any lease or contract between any parties in that the city and its administrative officials are relying on the sworn representations of the applicant in issuing the permit; and
(iii)
Shall not give standing to another party to request that the board of zoning adjustment determine whether ownership rights in the building or a contractual right or leasehold right gives such party the right to control the erection of or the content of the sign for which the permit was issued. While no building signature sign may be erected without a permit, the allocation of the right between private parties as to which party has the right to apply for and erect a permitted building signature sign on a building where such sign could otherwise be erected shall at all times be determined by the contractual, leasehold or ownership rights of the qualifying principal occupants and the owners, such that in the case of this type of dispute, the parties shall be obligated to settle such dispute between them in a court of competent jurisdiction in that the board of zoning adjustment is not empowered to make such determinations.

(5)
The content of the message to be conveyed shall not be considered.
(6)
Whenever in these regulations a certificate of appropriateness is required for a sign, the certificate shall be granted or denied within 30 days from the filing of the initial application.

Provided, however, if the commission subsequently takes action on the certificate, the director is authorized to take the appropriate action necessary to cause the sign to come into compliance with that decision.
(7)
Any appeal from any decision made on the issuance or denial of a certificate shall be granted or denied within 60 days of the initial filing of the appeal. If the appeal is not granted or denied within this time period, the applicant may proceed as if the appeal was decided in his favor.

Regulations for Changing Signs and Signs Employing Changing Sign Technology:
(1)
Each message displayed on any changing sign display shall remain static for at least ten seconds following the completion of its transition from the previous message. As used in this subsection "static" shall mean a display that is fixed in one position with no portion of the display being in motion or changing in color or light intensity.
(2)
When a message is changed mechanically, the transition between a complete static display of the previous message and a complete static display of the next message shall be accomplished in three seconds or less. The transition period shall be measured as that period between any movement of any part of the display of the previous message and the time that the display of the next message is fully static.
(3)
When a message is changed electronically, the transition between a complete static display of the previous message and a complete static display of the next message shall be accomplished in two seconds or less. The transition period shall be measured as that period between the time that the previous message is static and fully illuminated and the next message is static and fully illuminated.
(4)
No changing sign may include animated, flashing, full-motion video or other intermittent elements. The transition period between two fully illuminated static messages displays in an electronically changed sign shall not be considered an intermittent element so long as the purpose of the changing light intensity is to fade or dissolve into the next message.
(5)
No changing sign may have any type of changing effect on the border of the sign that is not fully integrated with a static message display and which does not transition to the next static message display in the same manner as the rest of the display.
(6)
No display or other effect from any electronically changed sign shall cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. Such display or effect shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this chapter.
(7)
An electronically changed sign which uses the scrolling of letters, numbers or symbols onto the sign face to form words or messages shall be allowed to appear on the sign face from only one direction for each static display. Messages transitions achieved by means of the scrolling of the letters, numbers or symbols shall be completed within two seconds and shall remain static for at least ten seconds following the completion of the transition from the previous message.
(8)
All signs shall appropriately adjust display brightness as ambient light levels change so that the brightness of the display does not cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. The failure of an electronically changed sign to appropriately adjust display brightness as ambient light levels change shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this chapter.
(9)
No malfunction of a changing sign shall cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. Any such condition resulting from a malfunction shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this chapter.

(17)
Any billboard sign which applies to employ changing sign technology shall be required to include as a part of its application, a statement which shall indicate whether the applicant is willing to allow law enforcement agencies to utilize its display capabilities to disseminate emergency messages.
(18)
Any changing sign currently in existence shall comply with the regulations of this part. If a changing sign currently in existence cannot meet these requirements due to the limitations of the technology being employed, the owner of the sign shall be allowed to continue the existing use upon a showing, satisfactory to the director, that the requirements of this part cannot be met.
(19)
Large screen video display signs which are permitted in SPI-1 shall be regulated by the specific provisions applicable to that type of sign.

West End/Lee Street Overlay Sign District.
a.
Creation of District . There is created within Chapter 28A the West End/Lee Street Overlay Sign District. The boundaries of the District are shown on the West End/Lee Street Overlay Sign District Map, which is incorporated into and made a part of this chapter and this section. The passage of this ordinance shall be a supplement to and an overlay upon the existing zoning and sign regulations already applicable to parcels within its boundaries and the regulations set forth herein shall continue to apply when the existing zoning is changed unless a specific property is specifically exempted from these regulations as a condition of rezoning. The regulations set forth in this chapter, or set forth elsewhere in this part when referred to in this chapter, are regulations which are applicable in those parts of the city designated as being a part of the West End/Lee Street Overlay Sign District.
b.
Authority . This chapter is enacted pursuant to the city's exclusive zoning and planning authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia, including without limitation Article IX. Section II, Paragraph III and Article XI Section II, Paragraph IV, as well as authority granted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to O.C.G.A. § 36-35-3, O.C.G.A. § 36-66-2, and O.C.G.A. § 36-70-3, the City of Atlanta Charter, Article I, Section 102(c)(42) as well as the general police powers of the city and such other authority as may be provided by applicable, state, federal and local laws.
c.
Findings, Purpose and Intent. The City of Atlanta finds that:
i.
The size, scale and character of buildings and uses in the West End zoning district (SPI-21) and along Lee Street, beginning West End Avenue to the north and Campbellton Road to the south directly affects the adjacent neighborhoods and the public health, safety and welfare;
ii.
Due to the large amount of vehicular traffic which is drawn to the West End neighborhood and Lee Street corridor, visual clutter created by window signs on commercially zoned or used properties can be distracting to drivers and may create unsafe conditions;
iii.
The visual clutter of window signs on commercially zoned or used properties within the West End neighborhood and Lee Street corridor detract from the aesthetically pleasing nature of the corridor;
iv.
The current regulations of window signs in the NC-6 (Cascade Heights Neighborhood Commercial) District contribute to vehicular and pedestrian safety as well as the aesthetic look of the store fronts in that district and that similar regulations should be adopted along the West End neighborhood and Lee Street corridor; and
v.
There is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to address these public health safety and welfare concerns through the adoption of the regulations set forth in this chapter which shall supplement the existing zoning controls imposed by this part and other parts of the Code.
d.
Definition: For the purpose of this section (52), the following definition as well as all other definitions set forth in the Sign Ordinance shall apply within the District:

e.
Type, Number, Area: Window signs, as defined herein, shall not require a sign permit prior to display but shall only be permitted as follows:
i.
On parcels commercially zoned such as, but not limited to, C-2, MR, or SPI-21, conditionally or not, not more than two window signs per establishment shall be allowed. Each such individual sign shall not be larger than four square feet. In no event shall one or more of such signs cover more than 25 percent of the area of each window pane in which a sign is placed. Such signs shall not be illuminated, except that one such sign per establishment may be illuminated. Window signs shall not be counted toward any wall sign total square footage allowed by the underlying zoning district sign regulations.
ii.
Any window sign in lawful existence prior to the effective date of this amendment shall be removed within a reasonable period of time so as to allow recoupment of cost to the sign owner. Cost shall be evidence by receipts or other evidence of actual cost in procuring the window sign. Removal of said signage shall be as follows:
A)
Any sign with a cost of $100.00 or less shall be removed within 30 days of the effective date of this amendment.
B)

Recognize that large scale sporting events, major conventions, and other large and significant entertainment activities in downtown Atlanta have unique needs for signage which is a critical consideration for sponsors and organizers selecting a location to host the event;
2.
Create the Arts and Entertainment District, as a sign overlay district, and allow, through certain limitations set forth herein (the "Regulations"), additional signage for the specific and unique building forms, mass, scale and use of the buildings within the Arts and Entertainment District;

Expand the economic base of the City, by providing additional employment opportunities and additional tax revenues to the City and the region by making the area of the A&E District more attractive through the management of specialized signage opportunities that will allow large scale sporting events, major conventions, and activities at major entertainment venues to choose the City when evaluating their choices of location;
4.
Manage the placement of the additional signage so as to balance the economic development needs of the City in attracting large scale sporting events, major conventions, and activities at major entertainment venues with the general welfare of residents and businesses;
5.
Create a process for the management of permits for the additional signage pursuant to a cooperation agreement with Atlanta Downtown Improvement District ("ADID") so that the sponsors and organizers of large scale sporting events, major conventions, and qualifying activities at major entertainment venues can deal with a single entity in order to create a "unified look and feel" for their event;
6.
Demonstrate the City's commitment to economic development through its cooperation agreement with ADID so as to allow the contractual governance and enforcement of a unified approach to the streetscape and certain aspects of the built environment for large scale sporting events, major conventions, and qualifying activities at major entertainment venues which will allow the City to focus on traffic planning, crowd control and other key elements of public safety;
7.
Enhance the general streetscape in the area encompassed by the district through the establishment of design guidelines providing additional signage opportunities permitted by these regulations;
8.
Contribute to the overall welfare of the residents in the district by providing a more lively and enhanced streetscape to encourage a walkable downtown with more activity and which could lead to increased property values;
9.
Allow for the management of supplemental signage, art, and other programs by the Atlanta Downtown Improvement District, with the input of other downtown stakeholder's that will protect the public interest and balance the commercial and economic initiatives with an approach designed to keep downtown aesthetically pleasing, safe for pedestrians and vehicular traffic, and respectful of interests of residents and businesses; and

If an application for encroachment is pending the fact that such permission is pending shall not prevent the director from receiving an application but no permit for erection shall be issued until a fully executed encroachment agreement approved by the Commissioner of the Department of Public Works has been received.
6.
All applications are to be reviewed by the office of traffic and transportation prior to the issuance of a permit to verify that no sign shall be erected or lit on a premises or location, in such a manner so as to obstruct the view of, or be confused with any authorized traffic signal, notice or control device, or with lights on any emergency vehicle, or so to create hazards or distractions to drivers because of direct or reflected natural or artificial light, flashing, intermittent or flickering lighting or real or apparent movement.

m.
Criteria for the Sign Plan. The Sign Plan, which is adopted as a part of the economic development purpose associated with these regulations, is developed based on criteria which are intended to allow flexibility in the development of signage in the district.
1.
The aesthetic and architectural compatibility of the proposed sign to the building upon which the sign is to be displayed or suspended;
2.
The use of the building mass and orientation in the placement of the sign so as to define and place strong visual emphasis on the street and other important public open spaces;
3.
Whether the sign will enliven building facades and avoid extensive blank walls that would detract from the visual interest and appearance of an active streetscape and unify a building's appearance so as to add to a street facade's interest, scale and three-dimensional quality;
4.
Whether the signage will direct attention to street level architecture and building uses in a manner that adds richness and variety to the pedestrian experience of the district;
5.
Whether the signage will assist buildings to display a clear pattern of openings and create shadow lines that enhance the street wall;

Where signage is at street level, it should present dynamic, state-of-the-art facades with expressive lighting, audio-visual effects, and dimensional signage;
8.
Signs should appear as an integral part of the building design so as not to appear as an afterthought application;
9.
Whether the sign uses means of illumination such as neon tubes, fiber optics, incandescent lamps, LED's cathode ray tubes, shielded spotlights and wall wash fixtures so as to provide visual interest during nighttime hours is appropriate for placement of the sign when considering the safety of vehicular traffic and the impact on the residential uses that will be affected;
10.
The relationship of the scale and placement of the sign to the building or premises upon which it is to be displayed.
n.
Cap on Sign Locations. Not more than twenty five (25) sign locations shall be authorized by this subsection at any one time within the district. This number is the cap.

In the event all supplemental signage is removed from a sign location, a new sign location may be authorized so long as the total outstanding sign locations does not exceed the cap. For purposes of this subsection, a sign location shall mean on the same building or parcel.
o.
Annual Inspection of Signs. Sign permit owners shall provide an annual inspection report certified by a licensed engineer that the sign installed pursuant to this subsection is structurally sound and continues to meet the state minimum codes applicable at the time of sign erection.

(ii)
No sign permit of any kind shall be issued for an existing or proposed sign unless such sign meets all of the requirements of this chapter, Part 16 of the Code of Ordinances, and all other applicable requirements of the Code of Ordinances or is a lawful nonconforming sign under this chapter.
(iii)
A sign permit shall be required for a change of materials or for the substitution of panels or faces on a billboard sign to verify that the sign is structurally sound, is at a location, and is of a size and height, which meets the requirements for a lawful sign under this part.
(iv)
No permit will be issued for any change to a legally nonconforming sign that enlarges or expands the degree of nonconformity, provided however that repairs and normal maintenance of legally non-conforming signs including the repairs and maintenance necessary to allow conversion of the sign face for the utilization of changing sign technology shall not be considered an expansion of the degree of non-conformity. An existing changing sign that is legally non-conforming shall be allowed to utilize this provision for purpose of installing a different changing sign technology.
(b)
Permit Procedures: The following procedures shall govern the application for and issuance of all sign permits under this chapter 28A.
(1)
All applications for sign permits shall be submitted to the director on an application form provided by the director. Each application shall be accompanied by the applicable fees established by the governing authority from time to time. No application shall be deemed to be accepted by the director unless all fees are paid and all information reasonably required by the director is provided by the applicant. All applications for construction, creation or installation of a new sign or for modification of an existing sign shall be accompanied by detailed drawings showing the dimensions, design, structure, and location of each particular sign, as well as total wall area dimensions when necessary to determine compliance with this chapter 28A. One application and permit may include multiple signs on the same lot where said multiple signs are otherwise permissible by this chapter 28A.
(2)
All applications for sign permits shall be either issued or denied within 30 days of their submission. If the sign permit is neither issued nor denied within this time period, the applicant may at their own risk erect a sign meeting the requirements of this part as if the application had been granted. The director is authorized, however, upon determination that a sign, erected for any reason, is not in compliance with these regulations, to take the appropriate action necessary to cause it to come into compliance or to be removed if illegal. After examination of an application, including an application which has been filed for more than 30 days, the director shall either:
(a)
Issue the sign permit if the sign(s) conform(s) in all respects to the requirements of this chapter and all other applicable City Code provisions; or
(b)
Deny the sign permit if the sign(s) fail(s) in any way to conform to the requirements of this chapter or any other applicable City Code provision. In case of a denial, the director shall notify the applicant in writing at the address set forth in the application.
(3)
No illegal display, feature, attribute or other part of any otherwise permitted sign shall be considered legally non-conforming and no illegal sign shall become legally non-conforming by reason of failure of the director to deny the permit within 30 days of the submission of the application.
(c)
Inspections: The director shall, at any time deemed necessary, inspect each sign regulated by this chapter 28A to ensure conformity with these regulations and other ordinances of the city. The director is hereby authorized and empowered to revoke any permit issued upon failure of the holder thereof to comply with any provision of this chapter 28A or other ordinances of the city, or to take other action lawful and necessary to assure correction of violations.
(d)
Lapse of Sign Permit: A sign permit shall be deemed to lapse automatically and hence be deemed illegal if the business license for the premises lapses, is revoked or is not renewed. A sign permit shall also lapse if the activity on the premises is discontinued for a period of 180 days or more and is not renewed within 30 days of a notice to the last permittee, sent to the premises, that the sign permit will lapse if such activity is not renewed.
