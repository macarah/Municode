In accordance with this division and article VII, division 2 of this chapter, it shall be unethical for any city officer or employee to participate directly or indirectly in a procurement, except in the following circumstances:
(1)
Procurement by competitive sealed bidding. Direct or indirect financial interest in or employment by or having any other interest in a business which is involved in a procurement with the city only through a competitive sealed bid shall not be a cause for a conflict of interest under this division or pursuant to article VII, division 2.
(2)
Disposition of real property by competitive sealed bidding. Direct or indirect financial interest in or employment by or having any other interest in a business which is involved in the acquisition of real property disposed of by the city through competitive sealed bidding shall not be a cause for a conflict of interest under this division.

Disclosure and determination of no adverse interest. Any city officer or employee who has a direct or indirect financial interest in any procurement made other than by a competitive sealed bid shall disclose the nature of the financial interest to the chief procurement officer. The mayor shall make a written determination as to whether the city officer or employee will be able to perform such officer's or employee's procurement functions without actual or apparent bias or favoritism and whether the award will be in the best interest of the city.

Such officer or employee requests or knowingly permits any person to proceed or to continue with the performance of any construction or services for the city, or to provide supplies to the city; and
(2)
The construction or service, or the provision of supplies was not duly authorized by the city council or the mayor or the mayor's designee, in accordance with the Atlanta City Charter and this code of ordinances, prior to the performance of the construction, service, or provision of supplies, and such officer or employee knew or should have known such fact; and
(3)
The contractor or supplier expends money, incurs liability or otherwise acts to its financial detriment in reliance upon the representation of the city officer or employee involved;
then in such event, if the chief operating officer and department head, in the case of an employee, or the mayor, in the case of an appointed official, as the case may be, determines that such circumstances exist, that there are no mitigating or extenuating factors sufficient to justify the actions of the officer or employee, and that just cause exists for the discharge of the offending officer or employee of the city, then such offending officer or employee shall be discharged from his or her employment with the city, subject to the labor-management relations ordinance in chapter 114, article VI of this code, where appropriate.
