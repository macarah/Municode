CHAPTER 19B. - PD-MU PLANNED DEVELOPMENT—MIXED USE DISTRICT REGULATIONS

Sec. 16-19B.001. - Scope of provisions.
The following regulations and requirements apply to PD-MU Planned Development—Mixed Use Districts.
(Code 1977, § 16-19B.001)
Sec. 16-19B.002. - PD-MU districts: Defined, intent, where permitted.
PD-MU districts may hereafter be established in accordance with the general procedures and requirements set forth in chapter 19, above. Such areas are defined as planned development districts for establishment of complementary groupings of residential, in combination with commercial and/or office, uses. Where such developments exist, or are previously approved, and where such developments are of a nature substantially in accord with the intent of these regulations, they may be rezoned to PD-MU status, and shall thereafter be subject to the regulations and requirements for such districts.
It is the intent of these regulations to provide for development of such districts at locations appropriate in terms of the comprehensive development plan and the transportation facilities plan, and in close proximity to mass transit facilities, in accord with standards set forth herein.
It is further intended that PD-MU development shall be in complexes within which mutually supporting residential, commercial and office uses are scaled, balanced and located so as to reduce general traffic congestion by providing housing close to principal destinations, and where convenient pedestrian circulation systems and mass transit facilities further reduce the need for private automobiles.
Within such districts, it is intended that uses shall be so arranged horizontally or vertically:
(1)
That residential uses shall be so separated from major vehicular traffic flows and other disquieting influences as to protect privacy and tranquility; and
(2)
That general commercial and service uses shall be concentrated for maximum pedestrian convenience and located for easy accessibility by residents of the district, workers within the district and visitors.
(3)
That residential uses are promoted within commercial centers.
Where such districts adjoin residential neighborhoods, it is intended that arrangement of buildings, uses, open space and vehicular access be such as to provide appropriate transition and reduce potential adverse effects.
